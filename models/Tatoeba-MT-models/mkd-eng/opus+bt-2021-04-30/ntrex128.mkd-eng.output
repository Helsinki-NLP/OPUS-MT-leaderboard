Members of the People's Assembly of Wales are concerned that they "look like mapettes"
Some of the members of the congregation are astonished by the suggestion that their designation be changed to MWP (the member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the congregation across the political spectrum are concerned that it may be the subject of ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party assembly said that his party is concerned that it "remits with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak Welsh: on Welsh twp it means "fooledness/insane", and pwp means "ca".
Plaid's member said the party in its entirety "is not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said works his party is "freely" for changing the name, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "mapet" is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Commission of the People's Assembly, which is currently preparing a bill to introduce name changes, said, "The Continuous decision for which any words to name members of the congregation will, of course, be made by members themselves."
The 2017 Wales Government Law gave the power to the Wales Congregation to change its name.
In June, the commission announced the results of consultations with the public on proposals indicating great support for naming the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of members of the assembly, the commission prefers members of the Welsh parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from consultation with the public.
Members of parliament propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus may cause headaches for Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on changes within weeks.
The Reform Law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules to disqualify members of the assembly and the design for the committee system.
Members of the congregation will cast a final vote on the issue of their designation when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was set up in an attempt to resolve the decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for changing the name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO entry.
St. Martin's bells quieted as the churches in Harlem face problems
"Historically, the old people with whom I spoke say that there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today, neither."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"People socialize in another way today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the daily rooms of neighborhoods where people go regularly".
And for churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of properties will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started from".
Churches, he added, can be replaced by residential buildings filled with a type of people who will not assist the remaining shrines in the settlement.
"Most people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and therefore will accelerate the day these churches close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built from the congregation of whites before Harlem became a metropolitan of blacks – Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white-metalists moved out in the 30s.
The conggregation of blacks practicing their faith nearby takes ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the confrontation of blacks during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who had taken a boycott of the vendors on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but since members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carilon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carilon "a ring of the poor".
The expert who played the carilon in July called it a different "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to play a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to the larger carilon in Riverside's church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merrivetter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has been going on in St. Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part brought by the unskilled leaders of the church, and part of the Episcopal diocese.
The Church Board – The Church's governing organ, composed of unskilled leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "will require the transfer of costs" to the church board, although the church board was not involved in the employment of the architects and entrepreneurs who sent the diocese.
Some parish members complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark injuries 13-year-old child diving for lobsters in California
Shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as diving for lobsters in California, on the day of the opening of the lobster season, authorized organs said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 p.m. near Beacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB television in San Diego that he was diving with friends about an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel stated that he first thought it was a thrill of catching lobster, but then he “found that he shouted, 'He bit me!
She bit me! ’
His whole key bone was visible," Hamel said he noticed after reaching the boy.
"I used to yell at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'," Hamel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Radi children's hospital in San Diego, he is listed as critical.
It is not known what kind the shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but decided that the shark was not of a dangerous species.
Gils added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries in the upper part of the tornado.
The authorized organs closed the beach from the Pontto Beach side in Kasabold to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Plans Enter the United Kingdom Beauty Market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty rafts in the style of department stores full of professional aides.
As part of a significant entry into the beauty market in the United Kingdom weighing 2.8 billion pounds, which will continue to grow as sales in the area of fashion and household decline, large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores all over the country, and will be presented in more stores the following year if they prove successful.
The beauty investment emerged after supermarkets began to look for ways to use the volume space that was once intended for televisions, microwave ovens and household appliances.
From Sainsbury's said they would first double the offer of beauty funds to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing brands L'Oral, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores such as Bots.
The supermarket also restarts its series of makeup Butique, so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something more increasingly sought by younger consumers.
In addition, the perfumer Fregrance Shop will test concessions in two Sansbury stores, the first of which opened in Cradon, south London, last week, and the second opened in Seli Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the tendency of buying smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets should do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cup, the director of Saintsbury's, said that the stores would increasingly look like department stores because the supermarket chain is trying to fight against the Aldi and Lidl discothes with more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's began placing stores on Argos in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habita stores after buying both chains two years ago, which according to them increased the sales of groceries and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and farming departments has ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Bots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement over the way of dividing profits from chemical means stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds was said to play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said, "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to fit any need, and the attractive environment and suitable locations means that we are now a compulsory beauty destination that causes the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "outraged" after Holly Villaubi withdrew from a contract worth 11 million pounds
Star Peter Jones of Dragons Dan left "angry" after TV feeder Holly Villaubi withdrew from an agreement worth 11 million pounds with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Villaubi has no time for their brand True for products and household supplements.
The couple's business is related to Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
This 37-year-old air anchor on the morning program told the Institute that it was leaving.
Holly Villaubi left Peter Jones, Dragons Dan's star, withdrawing from their profitable brand-new lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "rageous" when the television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Bukinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – mean she no longer has time to commit to their brand Truly for products and household supplements.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop and was said to double Villaubi's wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
As the 37-year-old Villaubi told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones hurriedly left Britain at one of his cottages.
One source stated that: “Truly was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was to be her long-term future that she would send for the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all concerned caught them absolutely unwilling.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, was so close to opening.
In Marlow's seat there's a warehouse full of products that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this anchor to a morning program, which is one of Britain's most paid stars, may cost the firm millions due to large investments in pillow and candle products, to clothing and household products and due to the potential for further delay.
And that can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Villaubi, mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Villaubi founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as president in March.
Twos go on holiday together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production firm.
Villaubi should become the brand's ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McCpartlin as the anchor of "I'm A Celebrity" (I am a star) on ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday "We are not commenting on his business exploits".
A serious conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and because he is so positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said with his voice disguised as "a news presenter".
"I haven't given up anything".
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump rated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearisation have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders of the UN Main Assembly that the North sees no "suitable response" from the United States for North Korea's early moves to disarm.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressures.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his speech at the rally.
"We agree well with North Korea," he said.
"We were supposed to be at war with North Korea.
Millions of people were going to die.
Now we have this great collaboration."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results – rocket trials have ended, helped free hostages and the remaining American soldiers have returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to a conversation about relations with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'll have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunamis and an earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island and claimed hundreds of lives
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no elemental disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international help, so it presents a challenge," said Mr. Sumbung.
Although "Save the Children" is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if they will be allowed to international agencies to contribute to relief efforts.
Due to earthquakes that constantly affect Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not a common sight in other coasts.
The obvious lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best of times, travel across many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for treatment of earthquake victims headed for Palu, but would take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The main point in the election campaign of President Yoko Vidodo was to improve Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and stripes.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of re-elections the following year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows, and arrows and other old weapons.
See: Daniel Starage of the Liverpool team tied against Chelsea
Daniel Starage saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss with a goal in 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to Starage to about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team was losing 1 – 0.
He transferred the ball to the left before leading it to the far stout.
The ball moved high above the sixteen as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally went through the jumped Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get to that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shak always pass as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Starage told LivepolFC.com.
"I saw Cante come close and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led 1 – 0 in half after Belgian star One Hazard scored in 25th minute.
The striker of "the blues" handed a heel back to Mateo Kovacich in that attack, before kicking the ball almost to half the ground, and then with a sprint went to Liverpool's half.
They sold themselves quickly with a Kovach in the middle of the field.
He then sent a missile, leading Hazard into the sixteenth.
Hazard passed the defense and finished in the grid of the far stet with a left leg kick alongside the Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoli in the Champions League group phase at 15:00 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in UEFA League Europe at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that fell in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit Friday and caused waves of 20 feet high, a spokesperson for the Sutopo Purvo Nugrojo agency said at a press conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was buried by a shot from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched since a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Mercyside this morning.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. with stab wounds on Grayson Mows on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard statements.
Detective-inspect Brian Ohagen stated: "The investigation is at its beginning, but I would ask the people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially cab drivers, who may have recorded something on the cameras from the cars to contact us because they may have information that matters to our investigation."
Police spokesman that the woman whose body was found was a local Birkenhead resident and found in a facility.
This afternoon's friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and as police have said, they will inform the victim's close men.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mows just tried to return to his apartment, but the police told him that no entry was allowed, no exit from the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The tenants have now been told that it would take hours before they could go back.
Someone heard a police officer tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman dressed in tears appeared on the scene.
She keeps repeating "it's so horrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, and another one was outside.
Numerous police officers were standing in the cordon watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters on 0800 555 111 quoting a 30 September entry 247.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament has become the latest memory blow in the argument of "subscription to history"
Its persecution would be poetic justice for its "taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "mentality" and "an attempt to copy history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell's Society, stated: "In the current debate on removing statues it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure before Westminster's Palace would become a target.
The iconoclassit of English civil wars was neither commissioned nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The beautiful presentation of Cromwell to Sir William Hamo Tornecroft is an evidence of opinion in the 19th century and part of the histories of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many think, perhaps more in the late years of the 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is a fully accurate play is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protecter are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
Murdered pig and killed Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a southwestern China market, according to local media reports.
The husband, identified only by name "Juan", has been found dead with a torn artery, dressed in blood near the cost of a market in Liupanshui in Gizzou Province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pigs on pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Kinghai Province, China.
He apparently travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yuan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighboring pigskin.
He stated that in the chariot he was a great boar with blood on his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound boar ripped up the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken up," said the cousin, given with a surname "Vu", according to a quote in Guyang's evening news.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked to prevent an attack on other people, while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and those responsible in the market reportedly negotiate compensation for his death.
Though rarely, cases of pigs who attacked humans have been reported before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years earlier a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an "activator".
"They're just playing".
They like to snack, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to southwestern United States
As forecasted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as she moves across the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain floods to northern Mexico and southwest United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a 5 p.m. Eastern time hurricane on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to develop and is moving east toward the west coast of the United States as Rosa nears the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm begins to pump large tropical moisture north of the southwest United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to the parts of Mexico on Monday.
Thereafter, tropical moisture with the nearby depression will produce heavy rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause rough floods, flow of rubble and possible landslides in the desert.
The large tropical moisture will cause rainfall that in some places will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
The severe floods caused are possible due to the rapidly exacerbating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is particularly recommended not to go into the desert on foot in the possibility of tropical rain.
The heavy rain may cause canyons to become stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local strong winds and dust.
Depression approaching will bring local heavy rain to parts of the South California coast.
Rains from a total of more than half an inch are possible, which may cause rivers of rubble and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
Occasionally tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday morning, before the rain spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will expand into the "four corners" on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected everywhere in the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but tropical landscapes remain with high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be found in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
It is expected that most of the central and eastern United States will have a hot start in October with high temperatures in 80 degrees from the southern plains to the spacespace.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast suggests the possibility of over-prosecutive temperatures for eastern parts of the United States, until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavano's hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's exciting testimony of the nominated candidate for the supreme court, Brett Cavano, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 80s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the unprecedented political situation continued, with speakers interrupting regular programs on Friday's turn at the last minute: Jeff Flake, a Arizona Senator, compiled an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Cavano had taken up a piano and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Cavano, in passionate testimony, stated that he was 100 percent sure that it had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen reported, watched on Friday.
The company counted an average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who look at offices.
To make it better, it is an audience of the size similar to a playoff game in football or the awards of the film academy.
The Fox News Channel, whose hosts heavily attacked Cavano's appointment, led in front of all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the day-long hearing, reported by Neilsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, said by Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After moderately the Republican office issued a declaration that he would vote for Cavano, CNN's cameras and CBS caught protesting him telling him on Friday morning as he was trying to get into an elevator for the trial committee hearing.
He stood with dejected eyes for a few minutes while reprimanding him, and all that was transmitted live to CNN.
"They're standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?"
He was told, "you have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks all covered hours later, when the court committee was to vote to advance Kavano's nomination to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that he would consider the allegations against the nominating one in the following week, which was asked by the minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part of a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns and with several senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had great significance, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavano without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Cavano.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" about coasts
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for a conference of the conservative party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018
In another interview next to that with her on the main page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Bregsit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the mutual costs is "totally absurd".
The Wade Simms shooting: Police arrest suspect Ditheon Simpson for the death of an athlete at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in Wade Sims's fatal shoot-out, 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Ditheon Simpson has been arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the brawl.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, said CBS's WAFB partner.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the parish pathologist of the eastern Baton Rouge released the preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head towards the neck.
The Department of thanks to the Louisiana State Police refugee unit, the criminal laboratory of the state police, the police of the Southern University, and the citizens of the area for the assistance they have given in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The Athletic Director at Louisiana State University thanked police for its "activity in pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20.
The 6.6-foot Beck grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 caught balls per game in the last season.
On Friday morning the team's basketball team at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team was "destructive" and "in shock" of Sims's death.
"This is what you care about without letup," the coach said.
Volcano Drops Ashes on Mexico City
Expelling ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern settlements of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after activity began in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered within a 24-hour period.
The centre followed more thundering and tremors.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in the populated areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicians noted increased activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after a magnitude earthquake of 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with the Public Order and Peace Police and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarised vote for secession.
A group of masked supporters of the separatists retained by the Public Order and Peace Police threw eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets normally filled with tourists.
Later in the day, fights also broke out, and the police used the clubs to settle fights.
For more than a few hours, the pro-independence groups shouted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", and on the other hand union protesters shouted "Long to live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterised the October 1 referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, though turnout was low due to a boycott by people who opposed secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police forcibly attempted to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narciss Termes, who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia has the chance of gaining independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties struggled to keep the dynamic this year with many of their best-known leaders either in self-elected persecution or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, recording a protest to support police, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oril Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before trial from last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londondery: men arrested after driving a car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repetitively driving a car into a house in Londonbury.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Kresent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective-inspect Bob Blamings said that damage was caused to the gate and to the building itself.
At one point it could be shot with a crossbow at the car.
Menga's score brought Livingston 1 – 0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston provided victory
The enhanced Livingstone stunned the Rangers by signing Stephen Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 games, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved significant as Gary Hold's side climbed one level with Hibernyan to second position.
Gerard's side was left without a guest victory in the season championship and will face leaders Harts next week, behind behind with eight points.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continue undefeated in the division during six games, and coach Holt has not yet faced defeat since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingstone missed his chance against cruel guests
Holt's team should have led long before they gave the goal, and their directness caused many problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but pulled the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgow could only direct his efforts from a distance after slipping Craig Halcat's head hit over the goal.
The guests gladly left the Rangers to play before them, knowing they could create problems for them with the set stock.
And that's how the crucial goal came.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston received an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together set Menga, which only by touch gave a goal from the center of the sixteen.
By that point the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but could not penetrate the defenses of the hosts, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly did not play.
That scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of Ranger's goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgow took the ball away from another set action on Livingston.
Livingstone's sixteen were constantly passing through and was repeatedly selected, while two penalty requests – following Halcat's challenge for Glenn Middleton's replacement and one for hand-to-hand game – were rejected.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasder Lamont at BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and score for Livingston
They were great, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward track.
Their style and game character barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
The captain Halcat was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Waral on standby.
Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as they were once under Gerard's leadership, they now lag behind with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once managed to open the hosts – and that's a slight consciousness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Colonja
There were smiles and blue skies Sunday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at fixing relations between NATO-Societies.
They deteriorated due to problems involving human rights, press freedom, and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then headed for Kolonja to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police quoted security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 outside the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, have also spoken out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposite protesters reflect the visitor's split famous as a hero from some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat from others.
Traffic crash on the way to Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A bikeist died after a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city in about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance came, but the man died at the crash site.
The collision occurred several months after another cyclist's death in a car crash at Childers Street where the driver escaped, about a mile from Saturday's clash.
Metropolitan Police said officials were working on identifying the husband and informing his family.
Road blocks have been set up and buses have been diverted and drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Latin Prison: Six Policemen Injured in Riots · Global Voices
Six prison police officers have been injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the prison office said.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Martin in Warskill in about 9.30 BST on Sunday and still last.
The Tornado units were brought in to resolve the riots, which include eight prisoners and are limited in one wing.
Cops are treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman said, "Specially trained prison personnel were directed to deal with the ongoing incident in HMP Long Latin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and may spend additional time behind bars."
HMP Long Latin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, the public order and peace police were called to the prison to deal with serious riots where staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with rough floods (can be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely occurs to hit Arizona, but it is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwest region, bringing a risk of severe flooding.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible flash floods for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Soite Lake City.
Rosa is expected to walk down a straight track through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
Phoenix State Meteorological Station reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones retained tropical storm or depression status in a 200-mile range of Phoenix since 1950!
Katharina (1967) was a hurricane in a 40-mile range from the Arizona border".
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the edge of Arizona's Mongolon.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Rockies and the Great Basin will likely have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those out of the risky areas for a rush flood, Rosa's rain may be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of this rain will likely benefit as the southwestern region is affected by drought.
According to the U.S. sushi tracking organ, almost more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, second highest category," said weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path led to landslides all over the Lower California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds of maximum 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes in contact with cooler waters in the Pacific and decreases.
Rains in Mexico, therefore, are expected with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"A 3 to 6-inch rain from Lower California to northwestern Sonora is expected, with possible maximum 10 inches of rain," said weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and in southern Utah until the late hours of Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains are the very heavy rains in Lower California, southwest Sonora, and the desert southwest region of the United States," said the U.S. State Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to bring life-suffering flooding and debris protos, as well as landslides to mountainous regions.
Attack at Midsamer Norton: Four Arrested for Attempting Murder · Global Voices
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with trial wounds in Somerset.
The teen has been found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace on Midsamer Norton around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He is taken to hospital and is in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in Radstock district, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had a cell phone footage from the scene, to step up.
Trump said that Kavano "has suffered the greatest wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"A voice for Judge Cavano is a voice to reject the harshest and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at an assembly in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavano "has suffered the greatest wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Cavano testified before the convention on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blasi Ford's allegations of having carried out a sexual assault on her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her allegations.
The president said Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliantness, quality and courage" of Cavano that day.
"The positive voice for Judge Cavano is a voice to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an immaculate record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavano's nomination as he spoke about the significance of Republican turnout in early elections.
"Another five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I don't run, but I really fight," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates".
Trump said Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct".
Cavano's first key vote on the Senate nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP head told CNN.
Hundreds dead in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and total death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed, many being driven by huge waves hitting the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, officials said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves of 6 metres (18 feet) hit the shore at sunset, treating many in certain death and destroying everything in their path.
After the 7.5 earthquake, a tsunami struck.
"When a tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and not running immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugrojo, a spokesman for the BNPB agency for mediating Indonesia's disasters in a checkout in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, pulling cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the mainland," Nugrojo said, adding that the tsunami travelled through the open sea with speeds of 800 km/h (497 km/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos of air released by the disaster agency have portrayed many destroyed buildings and shops, curved and demolished bridges and a water-torn mosque.
The resulting porches continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Assessment and Applied Technology Agency (BPT) said that the energy released from Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times higher than the energy released from the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographic position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coast, may be enhanced by the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugrocho described the damage as a "bumble" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims have been found stranded under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people have been injured and 29 are missing.
Nugrojo said the victims and damage could be larger along the 300 km (190 km) coast north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the quake epicentre.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" by Dongala, Nugrojo said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a post, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading for affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised Saturday for informing us that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had come about the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media you can hear a man on the upper floors of a building shouting frantically, warning people on the street below about the approaching tsunami.
Within a few minutes a wall of water plunges to the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a blackout that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened for aid only and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo had plans to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total death toll in the tsunami in Indonesia rose over 800.
It's really bad.
While the staff of World Vision of Dongala arrived safely in the town of Palu, where employees sheltered in CD shelters in the yard of their office, they went through scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief groups started dark attempts to start aid for the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad may only start coming if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a disaster at the level of province," said Aulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we can receive international aid, but there is no status yet."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that would facilitate the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who was pinned under the kick for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian State Paraglidership Team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia.
The others who were stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandaghy, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliderry, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon related how, when news of the Roa Roa Hotel demolition began circulating in the paragliderist community, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp to competitors from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only ended with a gray check-in sign instead of a son.
"I don't think that means messages are delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 when loading an ATM at the Newport of the quay
Thieves stole $26,750 from an employee at Brink's on Friday morning supplementing an ATM at the Newport of the Key, according to a press release at the Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM into the entertainment complex and was preparing to supplement it with money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "run from behind the employee of Brink's" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses spotted more suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to the statement, but the police gave no specific number to persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information on their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kane West: rapper changed his name to Yej
Rapper County West changed his name to Yale.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote, "The creature formerly known as Canje West".
Forty-one-year-old West was nicknamed Yey for some time and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurred just prior to his visiting Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show that had to give up "emotional reasons", said the show's creator.
Although he uses it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there means 'you'," West said at the beginning of the year, discussing his album's title with broadcaster Big Boy.
"What it means to you, I'm us, it's us.
He set out from Caye, meaning the only one, to just Yeye, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a display of who we are."
He is one of the numerous known rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Didi, but this year announced his preference for the names of Love and Brother Love.
A former associate of West, Jay Z, also uses his name with either a dash and all major letters.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use the military on civilians
Vice President of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador has pledged never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza that he "will never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
The military fired at peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at the time left-wing student movements were rooted in Latin America.
López Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans giving monthly aid to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing youth to criminal gangs.
U.S. is due to double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, so the United States should double research funds in the field, investor and practitioner for AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
Comments arrived after various parts of the United States government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States does not have a formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aspires to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
"Admission of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Fund doubles may double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will make it the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNN Week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowerers: China, Silent Valley and the New World Order" (Supers in artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order) was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invest in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 80s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American ottel player, and later served as director at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee thanked for previous U.S. government technology matches as the challenge in robotics of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next game would be, in order to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard in order to obtain state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think 'green cards' should be offered automatically to doctors of artificial intelligence science," he said.
China's State Council issued its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Foundation of Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions similar to the way the Foundation of Natural Sciences and other government organizations distribute money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Achievement Intelligence, which should cover partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of an authorized committee for artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for the initiative called "AI Next".
As for NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in research of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation requiring the creation of a National Commission on the Security of artificial intelligence had no action for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its requirements for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that its northern neighbour's name is the laying of law on its territory and vetoing its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments merged in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 per cent required for the validity of the referendum.
The issue on the referendum ballot read, "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to enable entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they could live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Gjorgevska in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1300 hours.
The turnout, however, stood at 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last 2016 parliamentary election when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Djoshe Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko cast their votes in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on 30 September 2018 in Struga.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov, was preparing a small scene and chairs in front of tents set up by people to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go in with our heads up high, not from the rear entrance," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we do have dignity.
If they do not want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I believe the majority will be for because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the result "yes" would be a "proof for our future".
The poll, released by the Macedonia Institute for Political Research last Monday, showed that between 30 per cent and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is under the necessary turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 per cent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent will vote yes.
To make the referendum successful, output needs to be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since they came to power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero at Manchester City spent all of Brighton's defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly mastered Brighton's defense in a 2–0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etyhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed between three Brighton defenders before entering open ground.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "greens".
Round a quarterback before running a few others on the edge of Brighton's sixteen.
He then handed to the left of him, to Sterling.
The English striker used his first coming to the sixteenth to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right foot beat Brighton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with a single blow to the right side of the net.
"Aguero has trouble with its legs," City manager Pep Gwardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55 – 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored at that point."
But the initial advantage of "the Heavenly Blues" gave Sterling the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before he led Sterling to the far stet.
The attack on "the Heavenly Blues" brought the ball into the net before it went out.
City will fight Hofenheim in a 12.55 Champions League group match Tuesday at the Rhine-Nekar Arena, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play match against Rockys.
Since Nashnels were eliminated from the playoffs fight, there was no reason to force another start.
But always the competitive Shercer hopes to stand in the central square Sunday against Colorado Rockys, but only if there are still implications for a playoffs for the Rockys team, which lead with one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rocky's crew had at least a "jocker" for a 5–2 win over Nashnels on Friday night, but are still struggling to determine their place in the first division.
"Although we don't play for anything, at least we can throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be played at the highest level of any moment I face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nashnels still need to release a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to allow Sherzer to throw in such a situation.
Sherzer, who will start for the 34th time, trained throw on Thursday and throws usually rested on Sunday.
Washington's right-wing is 18 – 7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strakaut-poenes in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Tensions for Trump in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding his election to Brett Kavano for the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of Republicans' turnout in the early elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
This is one of the great, great – I don't run, but I really fight, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You see these terrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means available to them, you see wickedness, insolence.
They don't care who they hurt, when they have to run over in order to gain power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And you've been seeing it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "dangerous, vicious, obscene and untruthful".
He mentioned Senator Diana Finestin of the ranks of Democrats, set up by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, to which the audience reacted with voices of outcry.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, no, wait a minute – it was a very bad body speech – the worst body speech I've ever seen."
Laborists no longer accept different opinions.
Those who express their opinion are not tolerated
When activists of the current in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last in the order of members of parliament from the Labour Party to be told that we are not welcome – only because he expresses his opinion.
My fellow paralementate Joan Ryan received similar treatment as he took a decisive stance against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censoring movement criticized me for dissenting with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Nottingham's East Labor Party meeting stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party Parliament, council meetings Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately today, that is not the tone of most encounters, and the promise of a "milder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if indeed, ever begun.
It becomes increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is being judged whether it is acceptable to the leaders of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I felt we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect to completely change my thinking and take views that I would not otherwise take, whether it was national security or the EU's internal passion.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there is a critical harassment of social media calling for condemnation, denial of the center's policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one with experience like this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments directed at me are usually political.
I have great awe of professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist harassment every day, but never retreat.
One of the most devastating aspects of this era in politics is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every demand for "no trust" or a change of selection rules, the party becomes with more narrow opinions.
I have received much advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then "all will be fine."
But that's not the reason I came into politics.
As early as 32 years ago when I joined the Labour Party as a student, provoked by the neglect of the Tacher government which literally left my classroom to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those most in need, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of dissent with the current leadership.
To those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to tell them is that when the country goes coerced towards Bregzit who hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste the time and energy of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have one message that is not for Nottingham currentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how condemning threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will deter me from sharing in a way that I think is in the best interest for all of you.

Ear 38 – 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ear goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this beautifully entertaining match on the day of Scotland's Championship in rugby.
They are now at the top of the chart, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as to their improved used odds, which brought the home team, and coach Peter Murchi has the right to be content.
"We have been tested through our games so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose stated: “A praise for Ear, they took better advantage of their chances than we did. ”
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Ear the advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for Wariors' game, allowed Melrose to improve numbers, and Jason Bagot seized an unconverted point.
Klimo delayed Ear's lead with a penalty, previously, on half-time, he scored a point, so converted a solo point to score 17 – 5 for Ear at the rescue.
But Melrose well started the second half, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by Bagot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long retention due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, which was carried out on a stretcher, and from the return start, Ear went on to struggle with Stafford McDowal's point, converted by Klimo.
Ear's VD-capitent Blair McPherson, then received a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the extra man with Bruce Colvin's unconverted point at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Strugan Hutchinson received a yellow card to bring down Klimo without the ball, McFerson won a touchduran from the penalty line on the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Klimo converted, as he did again almost from the return start, after Kyle Rowe took the hit on David Armstrong and sent wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.

The duo announced that the next 9th season would be the last and it seems that Kiernan plans for life after Craigleng.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmour Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source of the Scotish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to engage in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
"The Sea is Ours": Bolivia Surrounded by Land Hopes Court Will Reopen Path to Pacific
Sailors patrol a cover-line naval seat in La Paz.
Public buildings have set up a sea blue flag.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are glued to the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to return."
Throughland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost in favor of Chile in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the largest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the momentum, spirit of unity and tranquility and of course expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Kalsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the International Court's decision on major screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will judge in favour of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of variable talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant her a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia of native origin, who faces a controversial re-election battle the following year, also depends heavily on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he dedicatedly said in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favour of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to judge in their favor.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign territory to Chile and has stated that it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
That the ruling of the international court comes only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And the last four years may have put Bolivian cause back instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration used the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to speak, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, the Bolivian Representative to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Kalsadia also rejected that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the sea problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past".
North Korea Says It Won't Take a Nuclear Disarmament If It Can't Trust the United States
North Korea Foreign Minister Rhi Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ry spoke on Saturday in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep their promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Yong Un.
Rhi says it is a "fiction" to think that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to the decorative completion of the Korean war would bring Servena Korea to their knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang to first take substantial measures to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Tramp's second summit.
Paris's fashion reviews reveal the latest line of massive caps that is en route to the largest stores in your vicinity
If you want to improve the size of your cap collection or completely block the sun, then don't look any further.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of twisted too big hats for their SS19 collection on the runway that blinded the style set on Fashion Week in Paris.
The ultimate impractical hates raised the Instagram this summer and these designers sent their creations falling in the eye of the runway.
The piece that came out of Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide-scale plumage of feathers that flooded the head of the model.
The other too many supplements included melons with cirkons, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than of high fashion.
One creation resembled diving equipment entirely with glasses and a dive tube, and another looked like a melted crusted ice cream.
And if you go on with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style holders predict that huge hats can come to stores near you.
The oversized hates came very quickly after "La Bomba", the grassy hat with two feet wide carrying all of Riana to Emily Ratajkovsky.
The cool fashion house behind the too impractical hat that spread across social media sent another great creation down the runway, a flat-sized beach bag almost equal the height of the model it was pulling.
The dark orange rafia bag, with a board of rafia and with a white leather handle, was the piece highlighted in the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquesemus on Fashion Week in Paris.
The styler of the famous, Luc Armitage, told the FEEMAIL: “I expect to see the large beach hats and beach bags in the stores next summer, as the designer caused such a great influence that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many supplements. ”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results of exams, only reinforced by individual and group success in sports, art, music and other ventures of the community.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to do the best service to their students and parents.
Independent school strives to prepare their students for further and higher education, a career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement adjusted school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable as an elective object in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he will do so presumptuously.
If you speak to him in his language, it will strike him to the soul."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on only English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
As of this year's recent test results, we can see that languages exceed all other subjects with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students learning foreign languages scored a higher score "5+".
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students scored a higher score "5+" in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also scored "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly gain in the future.
Languages are now, as an electoral object, seen at the same level as STEM-premers (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs as well as elsewhere.
The Bank of the Committee of Employment and Skills of OK in 2014 noted that from the reasons employers cited for failing to fill jobs, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills become increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more language - seeking jobs, these skills are essential in the globalized world.
No matter what career one chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot an advantage before competition.
According to a YouGov poll by more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to talk, and French was the only language they spoke over ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
So to invest in teaching languages is now important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding significant employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important in OK when viewed in the future by 2020, as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be numerous languages of which can be chosen in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an environment of learning that will prepare children and arm them with the skills needed for success, no matter what the future will bring.
At the moment it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this must be changed in schools.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be considered as "national communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
"Il fut bien le fair" (it must be done).
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will take the Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday
Waiting almost ended for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first game in Sunday's prelude against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers Reporter, Mike Trudel, wrote that James was likely to play limited time.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in a prelude at this stage of my career to prepare myself," he said.
Yu-Tyub rally channel at Trump in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of rallies as part of the campaign, tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled Trump rallies in the next week, including visits to favor places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While a vote to confirm his election to fill the blank in the Supreme Court is on hold, Trump tries to build support for the upcoming election in the midst of the mandate, because Republicans may lose control of Congress by voting in November.
At what time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Hour Zone on the East Coast tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally via the internet with live broadcasts on YouTube.
This week is likely to address Trump's hearing of the man he nominates for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, which has become tense due to allegations of sexual behavior by a pending delay in the Senate vote until a week, while an FBI investigation is ongoing.
The primary goal of the series rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election .
Hence, President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies next week were aimed at "inciting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The congressional control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to that more federal states with the start of the hard season of campaigns," a spokesman from Trump's campaign told Reuters, who refused to be named.
Scheduled in the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, tonight's rally may attract supporters from " Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia news Metro.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, a state in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not good for Morrissey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls," said Simon Hider, a political scientist from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Coup Raider 2018: United States team has shown courage in fighting to keep hopes alive at the start of individual games on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the fours Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what the Raider Cup needed.
The redundancy of happiness is a fully invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
Who would you say's got luck now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we have a little luck, I guess," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
Europeans have the advantage, of course, a four-point lead and another twelve games.
Americans according to Spit feel they have weak wind in the sails though they have enough incentive, if nothing else then the form of Spitt and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spitt was excellent and lead by example.
Those strong shouts of celebration grew stronger during his game , with a key blow leading to a leveling four-four when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His kick that won the game at 15 was met with a similar shout, one that tells you that he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to dig in and take care of your game," Spitt said.
That's all that every player has left now.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed story of the Raider Cup.
Strange, but a beautiful duo of Europe is four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
"Mollywood" were the only pair with no bad kicks on Saturday afternoon, but they escaped bad punches on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players to win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players to provide a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf Nasional, except Flitwood or Molinari.
Both are preferred simultaneously in different holes.
However, talks on European fame remain unjustified.
Bug Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of double pairs, when he merged with Alex Noreen.
Misfire and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swedish in a hole they never managed to get out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double pairs and fours are so fascinating to look close to because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give to each other, the advice that they do not listen to and the way the strategy can change at once...
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved considerable leadership on the last day, but the four-way season also showed that the United States team could fight although some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans led 10-6 on the final Day of the Raider Cup
Europe will enter a solid advantage on the last day of the Raider Cup after Saturday's lead in double pairs and 10-6 fours in front of the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the two-beat attack as Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead by now on Le Golf Nassional to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which struggled to keep the trophy you lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the US team that had many misses in the morning double pairs and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans showed more resistance to the fours, winning two games, but they couldn't catch up with the lead.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points out of 12 individual games a week to keep the trophy.
Flitewood is the first European rookie to win four points subsequently, while he and Molinari, called "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second couple in general winning four points in the first four games in the Ryder Cup history.
After "smalling" Woods and Patrick Reid in double pairs they played great and beat out worn-out Woods and American rookie Bryson Deshambu with an even more expansive score of 5&4.
Woods who got through two games on Saturday, played great at times, but now lost 19 of the 29 games in double pairs and fours and seven consecutive times.
Justin Rose, rested while the morning double pairs lasted, returned as the partner of Henrik Steenson in the fours with a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coupka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the europes did not have everything after them that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set up a two-point measure for Americans Saturday.
They scored a decisive 2&1 victory over Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Puller in double pairs and returned later to defeat Polter and Rory Maclroy with 4&3 in fours, but lost the starting, two holes.
Only twice in the Raider Cup history a particular team has recovered from a shortage of four points in an individual game, though as title holders, Furik's team has had enough equal score to keep the trophy.
After being the second two days, however, Sunday's counterattack seems to remain above them.
North Korea says "there is no chance" of disarming unilaterally without trust
The North Korea Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extended sanctions deepen distrust in the United States and that there was no chance that the country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" in the last year, such as stopping nuclear rocket tests, dismantlement of nuclear tests and committed against nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see a proper response by the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such conditions there is no way to unilaterally disarm first."
Although Rhi repeated North Korea's famous complaints about Washington's resistance to joining nuclear degradation "in phases", under which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral, nuclear disarming, without discussion, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ry alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit in general of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to work towards "nuclear disarming of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump provided a guarantee for the safety of North Korea.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States claims Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to yield to severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclel disarming above all' and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion and even object to 'declaration for the end of the war'," Rhi said.
"The perception that sanctions can get us down on our knees is a vain dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Rhi did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the American leader emphasized in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added, "If the other side in this nuclear disarming problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarming of the Korean peninsula would not end up in such a dead end."
Despite that, the tone of Rey's speech was significantly different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean rockets to the American mainland was inevitable after "the Lord's evil president" Trump called Kim a "charret" with a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year with "full destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim much for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain to the nuclear disarm of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for it, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "Sunctions of the Security Council must continue fully and without exceptions until full, final nuclear disarmment is confirmed".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to derail funding for nuclear weapons and ballistic rockets programmes on Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rhi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but last time it didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea only a few hours after "gangster demands".
North Korea committed to a meeting with Moon this month for the demolition of a missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "suitable measures".
He said Kim told him that "the proper measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves towards the normization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses to get enough rest
A new Harvard University course this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to combat the growing macho-culture of learning by staying awake all night with caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world's leading university often know nothing when it comes to basic care for themselves.
Charles Chazler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School's dream and specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designs a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech on the impact of undersleep on learning.
"At the end of the lecture a girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said that no one, ever told her about the importance of sleeping - which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to the students the basics of how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic results and improve general wellbeing as well.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive of health services at the university said the university decided to introduce the course after they found students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a student home where students press coffee glasses, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how undersleep affects athletic results and the importance of going to bed routines.
In another part, participants learn about how a prolonged sleep shortage can increase the risk of heart and strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then moves participants to consider their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the effects on health when you choose to smoke a cigarette," added Professor Chazler.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and in addition to modern technology and growing pressure on students means that the lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to move into a hunger mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sou, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Teazler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course in the entire student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar program before joining the competent institution.
Professor Teazler recommended that students think about setting an alarm about when to go to bed, as well as about when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "Blue Light" broadcast from electronic screens and LED-light, which alteres the cervical rhythm, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal overthrows Gerard's men
The Rengers suffered another devastating, sad day when the Dolly Menga strike sent Stephen Gerard's sting team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Aybrox's team wanted to register its first win after a 4-1 February triumph at St Johnston, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second loss of Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the tricky lead team Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half and the Rangers set lost inspiration and chance of leveling.
Now the Rainers fell to sixth place, and Livingstone climbed to third and are only behind Hibernanian by the score difference.
There may be additional problems waiting for the Rainers after the line judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical attention due to head injury after he was apparently hit with a long-distance object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Aer in the Batfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 of Livingstone who won a point with Harts last week and would be joyful in the way his well-trained lineup was choking opponents at every chance.
The Rainers may have dominated the site over the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score, two minutes after the start when Menga's first run missed Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
A long shot of Kihan Jacobs then reached captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgou could only play openly in defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should receive a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Stephen Lawles clashed, but Judge Stephen Thomson gave no sign of approval of the Colombian's appeal.
The Rengers managed to score only two brother-in-laws to the goal in the first half, but former Aybrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not suffer from the blow with the head of Lasana Culibali and Ovi Edaria's poor blow.
Although the start of Livingston's 34th minute may have been the opposite of the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Again the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' impact.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who with a cold head chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement was quick to influence when the wing player passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with a blockade.
But Livingstone managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoy, with Litgou and Hackett capturing many of the long additions.
Holt's team could expand lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor put himself well and prevented Jacobs before Litgou played head by corner.
Rengers' replacement, Glenn Middleton had another penalty request after collided with Jackobs, but Thomson did not approve again.
Almanac: The Geiger counter's inventor · Global Voices
And now one side of our almanac "On Sunday of the Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and WE BREW ... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of the device known as the gyiger counter.
Since then it has become the main stronghold of science, the gyger counter has become mainly a stronghold of popular culture as in the 1950 film "The Bell of Colorado", featuring those seemingly untrustworthy, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a gyger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the earpieces, you can hear the effects of atoms that release radioactiveity into minerals."
Evans: "Release, it's got to jump now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery bearing his name still exists.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the stray cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the curved cells and kill them
Vaccina teaches the immune system to recognize the sided cells as part of the treatment
Method includes extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them to a laboratory
You can "see" protein honor in many types of cancer and then be returned to the organism
The trial vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the sided cells, the cancer of the ovaliums disappeared in 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient, altering them to the laboratory, so that they can "see" protein honour in many types of cancer called Her2, and then return them to the organism.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the American National Cancer Institute from Bethezda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot."
HER2 "inciting the growth of several types of cancer", including breast cancer, ooriums, lungs, and colonektal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach with the extraction of immune cells from patients and their "learning" how to target cancer cells functions in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanje West made a pro-Tramp outfall, carrying a cap with his motto, after a Saturday night appearance live.
That didn't go well.
Kanje West was spotted in the studio during a live show Saturday night, after a useless performance praising US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
Following the performance of the third song that night, called the City of Ghosts, with which he wore a cap labeled To Make America Fame Again, he began criticizing Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"A lot of times when I'm talking to a white man they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The Saturday night live show began with satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavano's testimony before the Senate's legal affairs committee, related to allegations of a sexual assault on Christine Bleesey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage on West's dropout was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had been having a hard time behind the scenes for his cap.
"Behind the scene made fun of me.
They said, "Don't show up with that cap".
They made fun of me!
Then they told me that I was in a sunken place, he said, according to Washington's Egmidner.
West continued: "You want to see the sunken place?" he said that he would "put his superman-cam, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love."
His comments drew protests from the audience at least twice, and the team of the evening show looked embarrassed, reported Varyetti, one man told the publisher, "The entire studio we know".
West was brought in as a last-minute substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
West surprised many by performing the song "I Love It", dressed as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the leader of the TPUS conservative group, Candace Turner who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits: YOU TERRIZED ON THE TOLPA".
But show housewife Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was herself and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'artity') for which I believe he accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with he now being "formally known as Kayne West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Didi, also known as Paff Dedi, Puff and P Didi.
Fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has the name Snoop Lyon and of course the late musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist of previously known as Prince.

The star of the series Dance of Thrones, Keith Harrington, attacked toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as skilled swordsman as Jon Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series Dance of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho-hero stereotype, when he stated that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they must be tough to be respected.
In a statement about Sunday Times culture section, Keith said he believes "something is wrong" and wonders how to deal with toxic masculinity's problem in the # Segakasam era.
Keith, who recently married the Trones' Game star, Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted to having "strong feelings" on that issue.
"Lically I have strong feelings, at the moment - where did we wrong with masculinity?, he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is inborn, and what is taught?
What is learned from TV and what on the street, which makes young boys feel they must have a certain side of masculinity?
I think it's one of the great questions of our time - how do we change that?
Because it's obvious there's something wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in a Tronovs game overtime when the series ended the following summer, saying that he "ending with battles and horses".
As of November Keith will perform in rebuilding Sam Shepherd's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing to come out of a Trones game.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose played the Games, a character who had a love appeal with Keith's character Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/ Sida: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and Sida.
More than 820,000 have been covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new events were transferred through sex, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of transfusions with infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yuan Province.
From year to year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Sida in China grew by 100,000 people.
Translating HIV through sex is an acute issue of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT community people is large.
Due to the conservative values of the country, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data presented by a member of staff related to a Republican party senator as "dangerous lies" and "the theories of conspiracy"
United States Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia legislators' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured that the claims were on "ultra-right" sympathizers and web-locks.
"Lagi, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes the home address and phone numbers of American Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hech of Utah.
Information surfaced on the internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while the Senate panel lasted for questioning allegations of sexual behavior against Brett Cavano, nominated as Supreme Court Judge.
The information brought out appeared shortly after Cavano's questioning by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redstead announced that the IP address which identifies the source of the announcement is linked to Waters' office and information has been released for a member of Waters staff, Hill reported.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and present an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff's staff -- whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of those untruthful and false accusations - in no way is responsible for the information presented.
Unhappy accusations are completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism on the internet, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"These denials are nervous" wrote Fleischer.
"This shows that she does not have a temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He must not question the motives of the defendant.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher apparently compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticisms related to Judge Cavano, who was accused by critics for looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in mid-term elections, also sounded on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal" he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the overreaching institutions and police about false claims.
"We will allow offenders to be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions which are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff."
The opinion of Johnny English Attacks Again - undermined Rowan Atkinson's spy scams
It is now traditional to look for elements of Bregsit in every new British-link film, and that seems to apply to this restoration of the fake, excise comedy Johnny English - who began in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: again.
Will careful self-exertion of the subject of how obviously we are going to suck up will be the new export opportunity the nation has?
In spite of all, the face with large eyes and many nums of the incompetent Johnny English received a license to "fill" things for the second time - his name above all denotes that he is a comic creation with a wide scope, made for the viewers in cinemas in places where no English is spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who in spite of his bizarre efforts for careful glamour somewhat resembles Clouseau, has features of Mr. Bin and part of the boy who plays a note from the song Kochii of Fire from the London 2012 opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.
Its foundation is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in the now forgotten Barkleys TV ad, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor's fins hit on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift of physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Impossible Mission themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humour seems to be meant for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy accidents are not as inventive and focused as the silent that the Bean character on Atkinson is.
The subject that is leaked all the time is that the UK is in serious trouble.
Cyber-haker infiltrated a super-secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the agent on duty - a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a more humble and combative figure and is already suffering from a complete melting of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson gives his best in this character of quasi-Téressa-Mej, but there is nothing special in the script to work with.
Its intelligence advisers inform her that as each active spy is compromised, it will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling out Johnny English himself who now works as a private school teacher, but "in black" gives secret agents lessons: there are several good boys here, when English offers a school of spying that resembles a rock-academia.
English has been quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former Fellow Bow, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, regarding a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for screwing up all things in the Royal Secret Service are returning to action and meeting the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bultova, played by Olga Cyrilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd acts: disguised as waiters they burn a French restaurant; they make devastation after they smuggle themselves into the luxury yacht of Volta; and English starts rights anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All the brakes have been removed for the final sequence, but as pleasant and noisy as he is, there's a lot of children's TV in the whole film.
Nice temperate things.
And like with the other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry play Rowan Atkinson to use his talent?
Laborists deny that they are tailoring a plan for British to work four days a week, but to be paid in five
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week - but will be paid in five.
The party reportedly wants the heads of companies to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "responsives" with the party's economic agenda and with plans for the country to be more inclined to the workers.
A four-day work week transition is supported by the Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A highly ranked party member stated for the Sunday Times: "The review of the strategy should be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a pursuit that is consistent with the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labor Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated a four-day work week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, aspiration is not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said, "The four-day work week is not a strategy of the party and the party is not considering such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonel used last week's conference of Labours to present his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to capture the power of "directors without a face" and "profiters" in communal firms.
The chancellor's shadow plans also mean that the current shareholders in water supply companies may not get the whole portion back because a Labour government could do "deductions" due to unethical behaviour.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of companies boards and create the Funds for Inclusive Property with which 10 percent of private firms' capital will belong to employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy makes a statement about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI investigation to Cavano can change their mind
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Cavano has delayed a final vote for his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and has been acting on the issue of whether the bureau's findings can re-think some Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview published on Sunday, "60 Minuti correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could discover anything that would make them reconsider.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think of course," Kennedy said.
“ I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after this happened after the charges came out and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, looks like a carved stone.
"My decision is made for Brett Kavano and a shocking charge is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied energetically," Graham added, referring to Christine Blaze Ford.
"All she names could not confirm.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will feature the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring famous stars and has an impressive mission; an end to poverty.
It is now held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizen Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people who will come to the large lawn in central park, not only to enjoy appearances of names such as Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012 is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless they want to pay for VIP-billette), participants must fulfill several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email message to some world leader, a phone call or some other useful work that will help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Golbal Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to ask for something to be done or just another case of "click-activism" - people who feel they're making a real difference by signing a petition on the internet or sending a message on Twitter?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters, who acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped spur world leaders to suggest commitment and strategies that have collected more than $37 billion and that will affect the lives of more than $2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and hints as the result of their activities, 10 billion of which have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the collected funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the power of Food, a partnership of investors and amplementors, based in Britain, dedicated to "helping children capitalize on their potential", which has pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help with the country's insufficient nutrition after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from the Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of Britain, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernourishedness, a note in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Power of Excellence, told the crowd at a live concert in London, in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been taken related to calls for the improvement of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding of the project, the power of the Diet, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the often asked questions at their website "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
From Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and difficult road - we're never going to make it.
But, like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardy B, Jannell Mona are some of the artists to perform this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America may use navy to "blancade" in order to disrupt Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior
Washington may "if necessary" use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinki has discovered, as quoted by Washington's Egzemner.
According to Zinki, Russian involvement in Syria - namely, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a front for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of selling energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that the sea routes remain open and if a blockade is required to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki addressed attendees at an event organised by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group representing itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he was effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, raising the stakes and replacing fuels," he said, while for Russia he spoke of "a awkward point" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement came after Trump's administration launched a mission to spur liquid natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from Trump's administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to deviate from the "inadequate" pipeline project North Tech 2, which according to Trump, made a "convict" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Tech 2 pipeline worth $11 billion should double the pipeline's current capacity at 110 billion cubic metres is only an economic project.
The Kremlin claims Washington's firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to put pressure and customers should be able to choose the suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stand met with resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organization in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem when the third party interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kemf, the first man of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "be careful to consider" whether to run for president in 2020, Masachusian Senator said
Masachusec Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "be careful to consider" whether to run for president after the mid-term election.
During a city hall meeting in Holliok, Massacusec, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our non-functional government, and that means a woman on her forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After November 6, I will be careful to see if I should run for president".
Warren assessed President Donald Trump's work during a city hall meeting and said he "leads the state in the wrong direction.
"I'm too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominates as a judge in the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a number of voters in her electoral unit do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "credible" voters from Masachusec said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the University's Political Research Centre at Suffolk/Bostonia Globe.
Thirty-two percent support such candidacy.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former Governor Dewall Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a potential nomination and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known Democratic Party names discussed for nomination in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin discusses Trek Palin's more traumatic syndrome at a Donald Trump rally
Trek Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he applied in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident Monday night
"The news that my son has been going through, what she has been going through since she returned, I know how other families feel about being torn apart because of the more traumatic syndrome and the wounds with which our soldiers return," she told rally audiences for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peylin called the arrest a "slon in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "they return slightly different, they return reinforced, they return and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellows from aviation, and each other member of the military gave for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alasca and charged with domestic violence by attacking a woman's face, along with a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for police in Vasilla.
18 U.S. states, Washington City support challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen U.S. states and the City of Washington support contesting a new American policy that prevents giving asylum to victims who flee from domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and the city of Washington filed a petition to the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum-seeker contesting policy, Anne-B-Cy News reported.
The prosecutor's full name in the Grace vs. Parliament case, which the American Union of Civil Liberties filed in August against federal politics, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang", had abused her, but the American authorities rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state defender representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from where many requests for asylum originated in the United States, as nations with permanent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy invalidates a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington City Attorney-General Carl Racin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "extremes decades since the passage of laws at the level of federal states, federal and international level".
"Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be adjusted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such provision violates that principle," according to a petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, defenders in the letter argue that a policy preventing immigrants from entering is harmful to the American economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the needed labour".
Public Attorney Jeff Seschns ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave a native country for persecution or fear over race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Seshns said when presenting politics on June 11.
The Asian was never conceived as a solution to all problems -- not even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are made in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her baby boy at an evacuation center in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There is no clean water."
Residents return to their destroyed homes and choose from their wet objects, to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, rested in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated out for frequent subsequent minor earthquakes.
Tears came to his eyes when he described the powerful earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor in which he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed in the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "malting" with "propagand advertisements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page commercial in an American daily by listing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US media to spread propaganda.
United States President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about China Daily's paid addition to De Moine Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of interfering in the US elections for the November 6 congress, China dropped the charge.
Trump's charge that Beijing is trying to interfere in US elections marked a joint US service for Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to press China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington , they are currently in a trade war in which they level the tariffs for importing each other.
The holiday tariffs of China at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at the exporters of federal states such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party, have confirmed Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former, long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a column in the weekly edition of De Moine Register, "now doubles harassment with propaganda ads in our free press".
"In the desemination of propaganda, the government of China is abusing the cultivated American tradition of free speech and free media by posting ads in De Moine Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in a nearby newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see a genuine reflection of the desperate opinions the Chinese people may have of China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the solid hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China rejected his offer to publish" on the column, although he did not say which newspaper it was about.
Republicans move away from women's votes before mid-term elections, due to debacle with Kavano, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are not watching or defending Bret Kavano's nomination in the Supreme Court despite several sexual assault allegations, analysts warn there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming mid-term election.
Emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already made it clear that they want to continue voting.
Of such things there is no going back, "written Grant Riher, Professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell College at the University of Syracuse, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Riher said he suspected that pressure to investigate Senator Jeff Flake's FBI (Republic of Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the Progressive Group Moveon, said on Friday, ahead of the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" in protest in the Senate corridor, when Republicans, who have control of the legal affairs commission, decided to continue Cavano's nomination despite testimony by Dr. Christine Blesey Ford, Mick said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be high," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
"People are already saying they are tall; that is true.
But they may be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of a sexual nature attack against a judge candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts suggest there might be negative consequences if Republicans continue the vote.
"This has become a major mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to N-B-C News.
"It is not only about voting in the commission or the last vote or whether Cavano will go to hearing, it is also about the way Republicans have dealt with this and how they have treated it," indicated Guy Cecil, director of Priorities United States, a group that helps elect Democrats, for the news channel.
However, Americans are divided over who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Cavano, although a greater number accept the most remembered side.
A new Ju-Gov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably trust Cavano.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Cavano probably or definitely lied in testimony, while only 30 percent felt the same way about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one more, to Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate Legal Affairs Committee, under oath, last week that Cavano had attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez charges that the Supreme Court Judge candidate showed her genitals at a party, while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Network developer plans to start new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Bernards-Lee, the World Network inventor begins with a start-up business that claims to be a rival on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Legend's latest project in technology, Inrapt, is a company that is built on the open source platform Solid, on Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burns-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment".
The app uses the Solid technology to allow people to create their own "soft data box" or a cut POD.
It can contain contact lists, job lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outluk, Slek and Spotify to be all available on one viewer at the same time.
What is unique about the personal database on the Internet is that only the user depends on who has access to some kind of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data".
The idea of Inrapt, according to the CEO of the John Bruce Company is for the company to provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to all.
The company currently consists of Bernards-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development programmers with a project's work contract and a community of codrators-voloneters.
As of this week, the technologies developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the tools available on the website of Inrapt.
Burns-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a full change where their business-models are completely turned upside down overnight.
"We are not asking for their permission".
In a Media release published on Saturday, Burns-Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrapt is to enable commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid".
In 1994, Bernards-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the Consortium of the World Network of the Institute of Technology in Massacusec.
More recently, Burns-Lee has been an influential speaker in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even when launching Inrapt, Burns-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Network, the Foundation of the Internet and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the new era of the internet," Burns-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Famous First World War Victorian Cross holder · Global Voices
The only priest of the Anglican Church to receive a Victorian cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, honorary Bernard Van received the confession on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellengliz and Lehaukur.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military decoration.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was a "incredible symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the decoration.
According to London's Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Colonel Van led his battalion via Canal de Saint-Qventin "Nez very dense fog and under heavy fire from cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to where the shots were fired and with "the greatest courage" led forward, before attacking a cannon's nest on his own and incapacitating three of the servicemen.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's works were "something I know I will never be able to fulfill, but it's something that makes us modest."
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Van said that "it is a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support given by many people."
Fans of combined martial arts remained awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead received Pepa Prase
Imagine, you've been up all night watching the 206 Belator without having the opportunity to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card being shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 in the morning, only that Gerard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, spectators in Britain remained stunned when the channel switched to Pepa Prase.
Some were not impressed after remaining awake until the early hours for fighting.
One of the fans on Twitter described the transfer of a children's cartoon Phil as a "some sick joke".
"The law is such that at 6 a.m. that content was inadequate, so they had to switch to a children's program," said Dave Schwarz, Vice President of the Belator of Marketing and Communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Pepa pig", yes"
The president of the Belator Company Scott Hooker said they will work on a schedule that will include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think when I think about restarting, I think we can probably find a solution," Hooker said.
"But it's six in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution Sunday after our time and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, at the transfer, we got a lot of messages and none of them were kind.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights, instead of six—as we usually do—we tried to deliver more for the fans and we overdid it.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Discs on a Desert Island: Tom Daley felt "inferred" due to sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone for his sexuality - but it motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to high school that "they're not all like me"
Speaking on Radio 4's first free island discs presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the Long Years' Show Kirsty Young took a multi-month vacation due to illness.
Announced as a supporting character in Lavern's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, those feelings of lower value and diversity were the things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so that he would not let everyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two bronze medal Olympian became a famous LGBT-kampany supporter and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said of falling in love with a man - American film creator Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "surpriseed me".
Daily married the Oscar, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at an early age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it is difficult to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, to a son called Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daley said that "all of his views" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was related to "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than gold medal at the Olympics.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011, aged 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't say 'you won't be here to be in the first row'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died and finally realized he was invincible," he said.
The following year the Daily competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about all my life - jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Pride from Heather Small - that turned in his mind in preparations for the Olympics and still weighed on.
Discs on a desert island of the BBC Radio 4 is on Sunday at 11:15 British summertime.
Mikkelson, to the off-form, was on the bench during the Raider Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mikkelson will set a record Sunday when he plays at the Raider Cup's 47th game, but will have to change shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mikkelson, who plays at the binary event, a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Furik during Saturday's double pairs and fours.
Instead of being the center of attention, as it often represents the United States, the five-time winner, he shared the time to cheer and practice on his game, on the range, in the hope of fixing what he was spinning.
He was never the best leader, not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the narrow field Le Golf Nassional, where distant rough blows are a regular punishment of carelessness.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mikkelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces the precise champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who plays in pair with rookie Tommy Flitwood to win all four games this week.
If Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual games, start hard, Mikkelson's game can be crucial.
Furick expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see another.
"He fully understands the role he had today, touched me on his back and put his hand around me and said he will be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of self-esteem in him.
He is part of the famous and has given much for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it went that way and we thought we had to do so.
He likes to play, like everyone else."
Mikkelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Raider Cup games on Sunday.
It may be the end of a career in the Raider Cup where it never achieved the best results in its individual career.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven halves, although Furic said his presence carries something immaterial on the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's resourceful, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great man at team meetings," he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun in the game with him, like this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers a lot more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that considerable leadership before individual games in the last day of the Raider Cup can easily turn into an incompetent position.
The Danish debuted at a game in Valderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead in front of Americans, but "they crossed the line to the target only with the noses", with the lowest lead of 141–2-131′2.
"I remind myself that we had a great lead in Walderama; we had a great lead in Brookline, when we also lost in Walderama, when we won by a little," Bjorn said, graphicly, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a lead of 10-6 at Le Golf Nassional.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Go ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play it right.
This is not completed as long as the match lasts.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy and the focus remains on it.
All I'm saying, I'm focusing on 12 players in our team, but we're fully aware of the opposing side - the best players in the world."
He added Bjorn satisfied with the results of his players in a difficult golf course: "I don't want to give early grades on that issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Tomorrow we are expected by individual games, and that is a different matter.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all abilities as a golfer are tested.
That's the message that should be sent to the players, to do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he should do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furick will require players to play better individually than they played in doubles, exceptions are Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself was at both ends of changes on the last day, as he was part of the win team at Brookline before ending as a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medina.
When the momentum starts in a particular direction, it carries a lot of pressure to midfield.
We set the line appropriate and the crew's order is by how we feel, you know, we want to make a spell tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of resisting first and confronting Rory McElroy the most important game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Polter in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to perform in this way with the boys because I think that's how we'll cover everything," Bjorn said of the choice in the individual games.
The new German warship has been delayed again
The German Navy's latest frigate was to be delivered in 2014 to replace obsolete warships from the Cold War era, but it will not happen until at least next year due to the wrong systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The contesting of Reinland-Faltz, the new class frigate ship Baden-Wittemberg, has now been delayed to the first half of 2019, according to the daily Di Cate, calling for a spokesman of the military.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014 but problematic issues after delivery hampered the fate of an ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wetemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be a substitute for obsolete frigates from the Bremen class.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of antiplane weapons and naval rockets, as well as some stalt-technology, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trail.
Among other important features is the less expensive maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be away by two years from domestic ports.
However, repeated delay means that modern warships - which should enable Germany to have power through the oceans - will already be obsolete until they enter service, notes D.C.
The puzzle with unfortunate fate F125 reached the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to receive the ship and returned it to the Bloom and Vos shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a shipship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cites a number of key "softvers and hardware defects" for which the warship was useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software shortages were especially important because ships of the Baden-Wetemberg class will have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates of the Bremen class.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
"Rinland-Faltz" weighs 7,000 tonnes and is believed to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from troubled hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible $3.1 billion (3.6 billion) - an increase from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest frigates are particularly important because of warnings of Germany's declining naval force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence commission, confirmed that the Navy "has run out of ships that can be deployed".
The envoy said the problem deteriorated over time, as the old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wittemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust eavesdrops on bats' secret life
A new property survey is conducted in Scottish mountainous areas in order to discover how bats use the area in the search for food.
There is hope that the findings will give answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide protection activities in the future.
The study of scientists of the National Trust on Scotland will follow the common and soprano-lillians, as well as long-eyed brown bats and daubon bats in Inverow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bats' activities during the season.
Anne-Eech-Es' staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of sounds from all recordings will determine frequency depending on the type of bats.
A map of habitats will then be constructed to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, a Nature Protection Advisor in En-Tee-Es, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of living are the most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
That information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development that affect the beds and loss of habitats.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as well as sticky fly lanes and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
Yet, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
Anne-Tee-Es, who cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, inspections of the beds, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even features the first and only bats reserve in Scotland at the Triv estate in Damphris and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The manager of the David Thomson estate says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Trive we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good habitats.
But there are a lot of unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us learn more about what they need to progress."
He emphasizes that it is important to check whether there are bats before renovations are performed on properties because unconscious disposal of beds can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Lions Protection Trust encourages the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats and other species, we just don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and lawyers will sue German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called rape accusations "false news", and added that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiel, which published the allegations.
Portugal's striker and Juventus has been charged with raping an American, named Katherine Majorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375,000 to not talk about the incident, Der Spiel said on Friday.
Speaking on a live video of his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was brought out today is false news," the five-time gold ball winner said in front of his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine" added the player laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spigel over the allegations, which they called "inexplicable transfer of doubts from private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Sherc said the player would seek damages due to "moral damage per amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident that was the subject of the accusations occurred in June 2009 in a gig at a hotel and Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark district court in Nevada.
Majorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "a good boy", but caved under that "one percentage".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had had sex but that there was an agreement.
Majorga also claims to have gone to the police and images of her injuries were made in hospital, but later agreed to a treaty without court participation because she feared revenge" and was concerned "that she would be publicly disgraced".
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking to change the treaty because there are traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer moved to the Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth 100m euros.
Bregsit: Britain "will always regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain "will always regret" if it loses world leader status in car production after Breghsit, said Business Minister Greg Clarke.
He added that it was "an concerning" that Toyota-Britain had reported to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant, close to Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of the border standing in the case of Bregsit without contract would cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which produces Toyota Auries and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain ejects from the EU at the end of March there will be a stop in production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain have expressed concern over how leaving the EU without an agreement will operate cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-Em-Wess, for example, says he'll close his mini-fibre in Oxford a month after Bregsite.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistics chain in case of Bregsit without a contract.
The Toyota production line works under the "right on time" system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a halt to the border which according to industry could cause delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily supply of inventory at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr. Clarke said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "correctly made to avoid such border checks".
"We should have a deal, we should have the best deal that will allow us not only the success in which we will enjoy the present, but to seize this opportunity," he told Radio 4's today BBC programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but other manufacturers are that we must be able to continue what is very successful set logistical chains".
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but long term warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Tswallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and has been a representative of the union in the factory, said that its members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to one government spokesman: "We have established a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed by the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney of State Rod Rosenstein may be "deposed for another week" as the battle continues over Bret Kavano's nomination for a Supreme Court judge, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Muller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, links between Trump's and Russia's aides and the potential breach of laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire Deputy Public Attorney and thereby jeopardise Miller's independence, sparks gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein had considered wearing a device to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with reports published last Monday he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday as he was at the time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he "wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a clash at the Senate Justice Committee hearing where both Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI over lawsuits against Cavano, which would further delay the Senate vote.
Trump's Press Secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on "Fox News Sunday".
At the question of the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date for the meeting has not yet been established, it could be held this week, and it could also be delayed for another week given all the things that happen in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things work out and I always try to make the press properly informed."
Some journalists contest the claim: Sanders has not held a briefing for the White House journalists since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the small number of brilliants is not due to the involuntary towards the "great influence" of television journalists, though he added, "I will agree with the fact that they have great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president organises more sessions of questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding, without citing evidence: "We have considered those numbers."
There will still be brilliants, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than to talk to me.
We've been trying more often to do that and you're witnessing that we've been doing it all the time over the last few weeks, and talks with the President of the United States will replace the brilliants for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
It rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York the President may have shown why it is so with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance before the gathered journalists.
Health Secretary with a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system regarding fears related to Bressit
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system expressing the country's gratitude and the desire for them to remain after Bregsite as well.
Gene Freeman, an MP in the Scottish Parliament sent this letter less than six months before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of resolved status applications for EU citizens working in lower-level public services.
Mrs. Freeman wrote in his letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU to withdraw continued during the summer, in order to make the expected decisions this fall.
But the United Kingdom government has also intensified preparations for the possibility of no agreement being reached.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That's why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of his citizenship.
Fellows from around the EU and beyond share precious experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health service and are of useful importance to patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Kristion Abercrombs subjected to emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Kristion Aberkromby, the defensive player (linebacker) of the Tennessee State Tigers was subjected to an emergency operation after suffering a head injury to the match on Saturday when the team lost 3127 to "Vanderbilt Commons", announced Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reid, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline of the playground and only scrapped on the ground," Reid said.
Trainers and medical staff gave oxygen to Aberkromby outside the playground and then put him in a stretcher and took him to further evaluation.
An official from "Tennessee State" told Chris Harris of "WSMV" in Nashville, Tennessee, that Aberkromby had exited surgery at the Vanderbit Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/small of injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually happened.
Abecromby is a second year student and plays his first season in a red jersey in "Tennessee State" after the Illinois transfer.
He made a total of five clashes on Saturday before exiting the game, resulting in a total of 18 clashes this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher administrative fees when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay higher administrative fees when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
This move will neutralize Corbin's success in trying to attract young voters
Higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The ministry expects this move to raise up to 120 million pounds per year, funds to be used to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay higher administrative fees when they purchase property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move would be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's success of trying to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high-income people.
Higher administrative fees will be imposed on non-payment individuals and firms in the United Kingdom, with the government's additional funding to step up efforts to improve the homeless situation.
The additional amount that in addition to the current administrative fee includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it may reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects the move to raise up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London have been purchased by non-Americans, leading to an increase in prices and caused difficulties for persons buying property for the first time in this housing purchase process.
Many affluent areas in the country, particularly in the capital, have become "spirit cities" due to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
This new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major contractors of offering high prices to the properties by keeping the land, but did not use it and asked Mrs May to change quotas for affordable homes in order to fix the "shame housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including tenant controls and ending evictions without justified cause.
He also wants the advice to give them greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my Premiership to returning the British dream, or life to be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies to be able to purchase homes in as easy a way as the hard-working British inhabitants.
The dream of possessing his own home for many people has become too distant, and the humiliation of homeless people too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "ending ambition" is in the future to become manager of the Scotland National Club.
The Scottish man, 42, enjoys the challenge of bringing the club to life in the northeast which is currently in third place in the first league with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer he moved to the "St. Miren Stadium" after returning "St. Miren" back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told the Scottish "Sportstable" on "BBC".
"But I grew up constantly watching Scotland in "Hampden" with my father and always something was pulling me back.
However, I could only get such an opportunity if I were successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland are Dick Advokat, David Moies, Sam Alardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyette and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of "Alloa Athletic" says he felt no anxiety knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club after he had previously rejected bids from "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"My success at the moment is rated with 'May I return this club to the Premier League'?"
Given the structure and facilities in this club, he undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get this club there, but I'll probably think I've achieved success here only if I get the club back there."
Ross has been working as a manager for only three years, in which career he entered after working as an assistant to the boss at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the coaching staff of "Haarts".
It then helped "Alloa" recover from the third-league dropout and brought back "St. Miren" from the edge of losing the title in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played in "Clide", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St. Miren" and "Hamilton Academy".
"That was probably a true crossroads for me," he recalls taking over "Alloa".
"I sincerely believed that career as manager is the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds weird because I was doing well, I was earning enough of it, and I enjoyed certain high-level advantages.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in the sense of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager and I'm doing it now, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever throughout my adult life."

According to one study the perfect beer time is at 17:30 a.m. Saturday
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has imposed more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July, but restaurant profits dropped by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA company for business consulting services in determining these figures said "The Suntime and Longer than England's expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when pub profits increased by 2.8 percent, and the restaurants dropped significantly.
The decline in sales of 1.8 per cent of restaurants in June has deteriorated further during July.
The pubs and bars where drink is mostly sold recorded a much greater increase compared to previous years as opposed to restaurants where a decline was recorded.
The pubs that mostly sell food were also badly affected by the solar periods, though not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and liquor sales increased 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales by only three percent.
Paul Newman, a vacation and hospitality analyst from the RSM said, "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to market sales outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to be in a difficult situation, although the decline in sales of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly devastating as a complement of the ongoing pressures generated by the cost.

One out of five children has a secret social media profile that hides it from his parents
One study found that one in five children, some of whom are just 11 years of age, has a secret social media account that hides it from their parents and teachers
Research involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Instagram" profiles
The news raises fear that sexual content is published on such profiles
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" profile they show their parents
One in five children, some of whom are just 11 years of age, creates a social media account that hides it from adults.
Research involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid rise in the number of "false Insta" profiles, a cut for the Instagram website where photographs are shared.
The news increased fear that sexual content is being published on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they have purified a "main" profile they show their parents, and they also have other private profiles.
A mother who happened to find the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter of the same teenager who asks others to "rape him."
Research conducted by Digital Awares UK and The Headmasters and Headmisters' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them was secret to them.
"HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of "Scottish Athletics"
Elid Doyle has been selected as the non-executive director of the board of the "Scottish Athletics" at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland and President Ian Beatty has described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the lead in this sport to take advantage of its extensive experience internationally acquired over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities has a huge respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a board member," Beatty said.
Doyle said, "I'm ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really make my own contribution and help properly direct the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200m and 400m titles at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the won total of four gold medals at the Olympics and which now appears regularly as a BBC commentator, could not go after suffering a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
Doctors told me that only time would tell whether I would recover or to what extent.
The whole process was laborious, but I was able to recover completely, again I can go and do agillation exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
A breast pump commercial where mothers are compared to cows causes division of opinions on the Internet
A building pumps company has caused a division of opinions on the Internet when it released an advertisement in which breast-feeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the product said to be the "silver breast pump of the world", user-oriented technology company "Elvie" posted a funny commercial inspired by music videos to showcase the freedom the new pump provides to breast-feeding mothers.
Four mothers dance in a cow stable full of hay to song whose lyrics sound like this: "Yes, I milk, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed these aren't fangs, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pumpi, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, pump, milk my chest."
However, the ad that was released on the firm's Facebook page has sparked controversy on the internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it was emphasising the "fries" of the dairy industry.
"It is a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, need to be pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, with the exception of the fact that their children are stolen from them after only a few days after they were born," reads one of the comments.
"Elvie's breast pump is discreetly blending into breast bra ("Elvie"/ "Mother")
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to market a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "It's really inappropriate advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, and one woman admitted that she considered the song to be really "ridiculous."
"I think this idea is genius.
I'd buy a pump like this if I was still breastfeeding.
Silence made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a genius product," said one of the comments.
Another commented: "This is a fun commercial for mothers who milk milk milk (often at their jobs or in toilets) and feel like 'craps'.
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while the discrete pumps were shoved into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk milk milk milk-saving pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely quiet, no wires, no pipes, and discreetly fits into the breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, to keep their babies, and even to walk out of the house while milk is milked.
Anna Balarin, partner and RDR in "Mother" commented: "Elvie's Pump" is really a revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By setting parallels among women who milk and dairy cows we wanted milk milk milk milk milk milk milking using a pump and the challenges it brings to the center of attention, while showing the incredible sense of freedom that carries the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has been present in all titles.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the fashion runway for designer Martha Yakubowski carrying the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has increased significantly although passing the border at a monthly level remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the fact that sharp retories and policies introduced by Trump's administration made it difficult to accommodate children in sponsors.
Traditionally speaking, most sponsors themselves were unenforced immigrants and feared endangering their own staying in the country if they asked to be the sponsor of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to file fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official last week testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying for sponsorship of non-admissioned minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the family of sponsors reside illegally in the country and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
So we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
In order for cases with children to be worked out more quickly, authorities have introduced new rules that some of them will be required to appear in court within a month after being detained, not within 60 days, as workers in shelters say the previous standard was.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not personally, in order to present their case of legal status before the immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit to obtain relief will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, workers in shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where due to its size it is more likely to overlook signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent town, without providing them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends may increase the traumas most of them already face.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to step down immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces illegally resided on the territory of Syria under the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they would be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and this without setting conditions," he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to lead this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of which train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions were good for them to return and accused "some of Western countries" of "expanding irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicise the issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided for reconstruction aid until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to place a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and voiced hope that military action would be aimed at jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to the election.
Mualem established the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "seeing members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in it.
Why Trump to Win Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless an impersonation and scandal temporarily discontinues his presidential term, which likely many of the Liberals hope.
In what will no doubt be the "most dramatic final in a presidency ever seen!"
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in viewers.
As of 2014, the prime time rating increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nielsen says that "Fox News" averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, which is 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and The Rachel Madow Show's "MSNBC" reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news is reported.
"This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the main television producer of the "Designed Survey" drama of "ABC" for cabinet secretary who becomes president after Capitol is destroyed by attack.
Nell Scowell, veteran in writing Comedies and author of "Just the Funy Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
She recalls one taxi ride in Boston prior to the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He responded, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs. Scowell told me.
There's also some fun value in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, to whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
Excluding from all of this is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an uninformed citizen when you have been seeing a panel of experts who debate the use of the source of "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", the carber jacket of skin from an ostrich of Paul Manafort of $15,000 ("a coat of fat arrogance"," as he called "The Washington Post") and the implications of the shocking descriptions of the ap anthomy of Mr. Tramp Trami Daniels.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what he does and gives you a sense of how to watch a reality show is that every night he brings you something new," says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of "Weelhouse Entertainment" and creator of "Pawn Stars" for the rotating team of Trump's show and daily twists (caries with the NFL, praises Kim Yong-un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because then you won't be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Fleming this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside of his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was imprisoned inside and watched "MSNBC" while recording on CNN.
He could not stop watching, at least not when Brett Cavano was to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
"I remember making all those crazy shows in the past and people saying 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.'" Mr. Fleming told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Export to Foreign Funds in the Latest Midterm Race for the Upper House
It is not surprising that the 17th congressional area in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funds thanks to the reorganization of congressional areas from where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is run by Democrats Representative Connor Lamb, who was given a seat in another area in the extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th congressional area, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th congressional area.
Maps were amended after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas were manipulated in favour of Republicans, which contradicts the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional area is a tough campaign funding competition among the main sponsors of the parties, the Democratic Party's Congressional Campaign Committee ("DCCC") and the Republican Party's National Campaign Committee ("NRCC").
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the emergency election for the 18th congressional district in Pennsylvania held in March that was characterized by widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area by a 20-point margin.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
US decides to punish El Salvador over support for China, and then quits
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing under little pressure by Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump's organization managerial team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, a State Department spokesman in a statement earlier this month.
But only in terms of El Salvador were in consideration of fines, which received US aid of about $140m in 2017, including narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial aid and target visa restrictions, would have a damaging impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment rates and murders in it.
As the internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar assembly last year considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading towards the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administrative officials stressed that they wanted the conference to advance and in an effective way to end any thought regarding the punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Penns is scheduled to address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attributes to the assembly, diplomats say.
And the three American officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations on the condition of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that may happen is the publication of special advisor Robert Miller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is currently very solid evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller reportedly also directs his investigation to the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign connects with Russia in her attack on our election.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to bear responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again in front of voters and possibly before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many insecurities here and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is his counterparts in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic need to make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike a coup against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The flow of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy accelerates or postpones.
Americans now face several such points of change.
What will we do if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is in the hot chair after this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secretly recording the president and speculated that he was uninhibited for the function he is doing.
Mr Rosenstein says the information published in "The Times" is incorrect.
"What will we do if Brett Cavano's new investigation requested by F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress to charge Mr. Trump?
If we fall for all these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe it will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was Jewish by Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on a table with a swastika logo.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Doras of "Rangers" with an optimistic view ahead of the clash with "Rapid Vienna"
"Rangers" hosts a clash with "Rapid Vienna" on Thursday, while aware of the fact that after a played draw match against "Villarral" in Spain at the beginning of this month a victory over the Austrians will solidify their position to qualify to Group G in League Europe.
Graham Dorens, midfielder due to knee injury was prevented from appearing in the season until the 2-2 draw game with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that score as a stepping-down board to larger achievements.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and came back with a winning point.
We may have been able to do a little more at the end, but the unresolved score was probably a fair score.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and we were better.
On Thursday, another great European night awaits us.
I hope we win three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but I'm sure with the support from the fans we're gonna fight back and get a positive score.
Last year was definitely a difficult year given everything that happened, or my injuries and changes to the club itself, but there is now some positive factor about the site.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can now move forward, leave it behind last season and achieve success."
Women cannot sleep at night because of this fear related to pension savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of the way they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by the Nationwide said they had spoken to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but don't take steps to discuss the same," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's where you're supposed to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not share your wishes with them prematurely.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how care can be obtained because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid cash insurance policy, which can help you cover your expenses or secure your own insurance with your own means, if you have them.
Deal with your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the very beginning.
Draw full health care so that you can supply a reliable person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider, too, the full scope of your funding.
In this way you would choose a person of confidence to make the financial decisions on your behalf and to pay your bills if you were not able to do it yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your older parent needs immediate medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medications he drinks and his allergies?
Note these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about finance, but who are the doctors?" Martin asks.
"What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make one plan like this."
A man shot multiple times with an air rifle at the Ilfracomb
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle on his way home from getting out.
The victim of about 40 was in Oxford Grove District in Ilfharcomb when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Police officials described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (British summertime) as a "official act."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are appealing to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the suspension of communications, aid personnel cannot obtain information from Dongala County, an area north of Palu which is closer to the quake epicentre with a magnitude 7.5.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people from Palu were evacuated.
In addition, several key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The town celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was struck by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala represents a district extending more than 300 kilometres (180 km) on the coast in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which represents an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially on the coastal region of Dongala.
Nikel watering is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acheh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them being residents of Acheh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the area near the town of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentaway, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, while killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow focus earthquake hit Pidi Jaya County in Acheh, causing havoc and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the resort island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested over domestic violence charges
Trek Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and Vice President Sarah Palin was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report on domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by police officers in Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is located in the Mat-Su detention facility with the possibility of exiting if he pays $500, the KTU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he pleads to the court, the network said.
Palin faces three A-class offences, which means he could be given a prison sentence within a year and a fine of £250,000.
He is also charged with a B-class offense, I fined one day in prison and a US$2,000 fine.
This is not the first time they have filed criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called on police to report the alleged attack.
The case in front of the Alaska veteran court is under way.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in a crime report on domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after saying that her son's violent behaviour stems from PTSN, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami: Hundreds Dead · Global Voices
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit Indonesia's Sulawesi Island on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical energy and communications networks have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Videos featuring the moment of impact are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the Palu Beach Festival when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors require a rare death sentence for a New York terrorist attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfulo Saipov, the suspect of the 1953 New York terrorist attack that left eight people dead, a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30, in October allegedly used a rental truck on "Home Depot" to attack a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and riders who got in his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the intention of seeking a death sentence delivered to New York's South District.
According to court documents there is the possibility that a death sentence can be handed down on both of these foundations of the prosecutor's act.
Weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury filed a charge against Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight counts of murder for the purposes of racketeering, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
To carry out the attack, it was necessary to "dividual planning and thought", prosecutors said, with the way Saipov did it described it as "grossomorous, cruel and perverted."
"Syfulo Habibullahevic Saipov caused, injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's families and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Lore Decat, Daren Drake, Ariel Earlius, Hernan Ferucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damyan Pagnucho," reads the state's intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since a death penalty case was prosecuted in New York's South District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of plotting to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months that followed the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told the investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 grounds of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a confession of guilt and passing a life sentence without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma of these events to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
A MP from the Tori party says that the FRAZIL should be in charge of the Bregsit negotiations
Nigel Farraj today during a protest at the Tori Party conference promised to "mobilize the people's military".
The former leader of the "Ukip" party said politicians must "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's lawmakers suggesting he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bon said at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out of the EU so far" if Mr. Faraj were secretary for Bregsit.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May in terms of merging of its deeply divided members was highlighted by counter-Breigite members of the "Tori" party who joined in a special protest against Bregsite held in the city.
The prime minister tries to continue implementing the plan from Checkers despite attacks from pro-Breigite faces, counter-Bregit persons and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and would force Eurosceptics and Labour Party members to choose between her package and "haos".
Mr. Bonn said at the "Leave Mens Leave" pro-Breigite assembly in Solihal that he wanted to "reject the plan from Checkers".
He suggested that Mr. Faraj should have been involved and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge of the negotiations, we would be out of the EU by now," he said.
The MP from Welingborough added, "I will support Bregsit, but we must reject the plan from Checkers."
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said, "We did not fight in world wars to be subdued now.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
G. Bonn dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people changed their opinion and wanted to remain in the EU is completely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori Party and pro-Bregit was also present at the march and told reporters: "I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Hammers plan is not well received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually the ones who come out on the streets and who are due to our victory in the election.
Please give up the plan from the Checkers and start listening to us."
In a directed message to Mrs. May, she added, "The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farraj stated at the assembly that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over a decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to hand over Bregsite, and we're here today to tell them that 'we won't let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Bregsit, feeling the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country which allowed us a win in Breghit and which will not stop until we become independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, counter-Breigite faces marched through Birmingham, before holding a two-hour assembly in the centre of the city.
After the group's assembly, this weekend a small number of activists appeared wearing banners labeled "Torievians vs. Bregsite".
Lord Adonis, a Labour Party member mocked conservatives for the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference regarding the application created by the party.
"These are people who tell us they can establish IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for the border without controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Bregsite," he added.
Warren plans to think well of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "well consider running for president" after the November election.
"Boston Globe" reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party's presenter spoke of her future during the western Massachusetts city hall this Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run in the November re-election against Republican Party State Representative Jeff Dil, who co-chaired Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event at Holodock was her 36th meeting with the electors after Trump came to the presidential post, with the maintenance of which he uses city hall format.
One of the attendees asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for "the women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top."
Suspect arrested in shooting case and Sims basketball player's death from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Sims of the LSU team that occurred on Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Diteon Simpson's arrest, 20, at a press conference at 11pm east time.
They released a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wede Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and as a result of it died," Police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, he reported "247sports".
Wade interfered to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the crime scene, possessed weapons, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
As a junior 192 centimetres that grew in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with the 10 appearances of the past season, an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 caught balls per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders secured him victory over Sebastian Vetell
From the moment Walteri Botas qualified in front of Louis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that Mercedes's team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the gender position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in a cedillo as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his teammate.
Vetel entered boxing first and left Hamilton fighting the turmoil at the end of the group, something to have a decisive role to play.
Mercedes entered the box one lap later and came behind Wetel, but Hamilton went forward after the action one to one who made the Ferrari driver reluctant to leave the inside of his own free risk to stay side after a double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Versten began from the back row of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round finished seventh.
He then led in most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the box at the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen came fourth.
Today is a tough day because Waltery did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team made a really exceptional decision to have a couple of its own in the race," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Finestain at Saturday's rally over her insistence that she had not published a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Cavano for sexual assault.
In his speech at the West Virginia rally, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but made a comment that what is going on in the Senate showed that people are "evil and obscene and insincere."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's been going on in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and vicious and reckless and insincere," he said.
"When you see announcements and leaks of information and they say 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Finestain, did you publish this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Wait a minute, then.
Have we published it... no, we haven't published it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter of information was sent to Fienstain about the allegations against Cavano by Ford as early as July, and they were published in early September, but Fiinstain denied that the leak of information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish her story," Finestain told the committee, reported "The Hill".
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked."
But it seems that the president did not believe her denial, so he commented on the same thing at Saturday's rally: "I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body speech.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body speech I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who was charged with sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats used allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You can see their wickedness, meanness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to step on to regain their power and control," said the president as the Mediaite announces.

Flight controller died helping hundreds of people on a plane to escape the earthquake
Flight Controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he was killed helping a plane with hundreds of people to take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to wreak havoc on the area, and many are stranded in the ruins of the town of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their own life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower at Mutira Sis Al Juffrey Airport in Palu who had repeatedly swayed.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air aircraft with a flight number 6321 which was then on the runway would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was collapsing.
He died later at the hospital.
Johannes Searait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian "ABC News".
We prepared a helicopter from Balykpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll may reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Siggy and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is increasing as many bodies are still under the rubble, while to many it cannot even be accessed," said agency spokesperson Sutopo Purvo Nugrojo.
Waves that reached six meters devastated Palu, where a massive funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told "Sky News": "Fast aid brings bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The minimarkets everywhere have been robbed."
Jan Gelfand, head of Indonesia's International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia's president, Yoko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN published.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now say that one man disappeared after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated with the aircraft that fell into the lagoon in the Pacific in Micronesia now says that one man has disappeared, after saying earlier that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
In a statement, Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon they could not find the male traveller.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to demands for more details for the traveller, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Knock Island Airport.
Officials announced on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident as well as the exact order of events remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy reported that the plane hit the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
US passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's an extremely good thing," said Janes.
Janes said that he and the others were able to cross the water that reached them halfway and head to the sinking plane's emergency exits.
He said the flight attendants were in panic and shouted, as well as that he suffered minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working near port reconstruction also helped rescue a ship on an intake carried people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) water.
Air Security network data show 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered at PNG in the last two decades, but none included in Air Niugini Airlines.
Analyst determined a time frame of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended up presenting the case Saturday for the retrial of the man accused of having a woman in Misspi burned her alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as a coroner in the field of intelligence analysis.
He noted for the jury that he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contrasts with his earlier statements, said "The Cerion Ledger".
When based on the data it was shown that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from her phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.
"The High Breed: What's a succulent hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to refute the negative view of this genre by including positive messages in its music.
"The High Breed" by Bristol claims that hip-hop has distanced itself from its origin as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to return to its roots and repopulate conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Foughes" and "Common" have recently experienced their revival through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black girl?!
New York nanny sues married couple for being fired after sending a "racist" message
A New York nanny sues a married couple because she was dismissed on the grounds of discrimination after receiving an error message from the mother who complained about the fact that she was "another black girl."
The married couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit was actually a "success."
Linsi Plasco-Flaksman, a mother of two was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of the new nurse Giselle Morris learned that she was black.
"NEEEEEEEEEEE ONE FNKINS," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaksman in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flaksman had actually done, feeling "unfavorably" fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is African-American, had done her job badly and that she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines instead, publishes "New York Post".
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day of work and was then sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the married couple and seeking compensation for the $350 discharge per day for a period of six months, an engagement that will include living with the family, what she was originally hired for, but without concluding a contract.
"I want to show them that there is no such thing to be done," she told "Post" on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The married couple countered charges of being racist, saying that Ms. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable act because they feared they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told "Post".
"But would you trust your children to the person you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be realistic."
Saying the lawsuit was a "success", Plasco said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in "a very difficult situation."
"Will you attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately denounced the married couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
"Paddington publishers" fear readers will be unable to connect with a talking bear, it is revealed in the new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond who was born shortly after accepting the book, stated regarding the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who is reading the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very interesting that we now know all of this about the huge "Padington" success.
After saying that her father who worked as a cameraman for "BBC" before getting inspiration to write the book from a small bear-shaped toy, he would still be optimistic if his work was not well received, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For "Padington", whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt silent pride over his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and didn't want to brag at all," she said.
"But because you felt "Padington" so real, it was almost like having a child that reached something in life: and you are proud of him even though success is not due to you yourselves.
I think Paddington's success took him in that way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always credited the "Padington" himself.
My daughter was on her deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Losis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried vainly to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that it will not survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"Then Over called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say good-bye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I really love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the drugs the doctors were giving her to keep her heart pumping was slowly diminishing and they were coming out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all her systems were failing.
I just had to sit there and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I could not scream or shout or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay together."
Eventually, Mrs. Onen-Laperuz mourned the loss of her daughter boarded the plane along with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bent my head, and the tears didn't stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt tremendous compassion for Over.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Sad women set cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide are making an effort to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys set up cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to seek support.
Ms. Davis's son, Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidde says her son had great potential to become a chef, as well as a contagious smile.
"Everyone remembered him for his smile.
People always said his smile could light up any room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place."
His brother who was then 11 was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid it will have a subsequent effect."
Mrs. Davis makes the cards "to let others know that there are people out there who can talk to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis lost her partner Mark to whom she was married for 15 years shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, or said nothing," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of the day of Christmas when the children opened their presents, and he did not look them in the eye at all and made no contact with them."
She said that his death is a huge trauma for all of them, but they must find a way to get through it: "Such a thing destroys the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we must move on and fight."

Brett Cavano's future is uncertain after FBI launches investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something that resembles what he was looking for, or a limited-time investigation, with a limited range, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee "is breaking down" amidst a entrenched partisan inextrusive condition.
Why did Kavano and his Republican Party supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance is due solely to timing.
The medium-term elections should be held in just a few weeks, respectively, on November 6 and if as expected Republicans face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, while lobbying to support Mr. Cavano who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Penns to change the unresolved score and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea "cut down" under Kim's lead
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea declined after Kim Yong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korea MP said.
Park Bjeong-Seug, citing data from the Southern Korea Department of Unity that last year there were 1,127 crossings to the border compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs of human traffickers are key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
Most of North Korean refugees are getting citizenship over time in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Korean people illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape via China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can be more easily crossed compared to the well protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees and often repatriates them into force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on the halt of the denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Yong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the target - the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korea Foreign Minister Rhi Yong-ho on Saturday accused sanctions imposed by the United States of staggering in progress from then until now.
"If there is no trust in the United States; there will be no trust in our national security and in such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr. Rhi said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Kavano "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Prestituent House called Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano "hysterical" and said that considering his temperament he is inadequate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this statement in an interview Saturday at the "Texas Tribune Festival" festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if any woman did so, they would have said it was 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavano's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavana in an emotional way denied allegations that she had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
Cavano was very emotional at his opening presentation, sometimes crying and crying while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotesk and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by Liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes that Kavano's testimony is proof that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he has proved to be biased against Democrats.
"I think it disqualifies itself with those statements and the way it attacked the Clinton family and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to take Cavano off office if the allegations against him are confirmed and the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he is not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not even appropriate to serve in court where he is in office at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavana is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned with the possible rulings that Kavano would bring against the Access Health Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, as he is thought to be the subject of conservative justice.
In confirmation hearings for his candidacy, Cavano did not answer questions about whether to overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to enter the court and expect us to say, 'That's really wonderful, isn't it,'' said Pelosi.
Women should use it, too.
It's a really sharp review, months and years of collecting rage that she can't free from herself without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She went on, "A woman who has been doing executive work somewhere, who told me that she too is crying when she is furious, but she has been able to develop her own technique, so when she gets angry and starts crying, she tells the person she talks to, "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm furious."
And then she keeps crying.
I think it's genius."
Tears are allowed as an exhaust vent to anger partly because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in an office where men dominated me is when I once began to cry with unspoiled rage and an elderly woman, a cold manager from whom I always had some fear, caught me by the neck and dragged me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they've been able to get to you."
Patricia Schroeder was a Colorado Democratic congressman during that period and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987 when Mr. Hart was caught in an extra-branched affair on a ship named "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she should not consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well thought out decision," he told me 30 years later through laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and Seven Dwarfs".
Given the fact that the campaign was long ago launched it did not have enough funding, so promised not to enter the race unless it collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave the men $1,000 each would give her only $250.
"Do they think I should have a discount?" she wondered.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign she was so overcome by emotion, or gratitude to the people who supported her, frustrated by the system which made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger towards sexism, she began to cry.
"If you saw me, you'd probably think I was having a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted to the incident.
"You'll think "Clinex" is my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She Crys"?
How the U.S. and China Trade War Could Be a Good Work for Beijing
The opening of fire with the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China was deafening and although the battle is far from over, the clash between countries may be useful to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States gave the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly during this week with the introduction of new tariffs for $200 billion worth of goods $1.50 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States of China.
Beijing returned each time to the natural world, which recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to pay back to the United States at an equal extent, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give up the same thing anytime soon.
To get Washington to step down means to accept his demands, but the public bow to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressures of the trade war with the United States can result in positive support for China in the long run because it will reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that with a quick political decision in Washington or in Beijing, conditions can be created to start a dramatic decline from an economic aspect in any of the countries is much more dangerous than it was previously established by the observers," said Abigyl Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, which represents a tank-tank.
Syria "ready" for refugee returns, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country that has remained ravaged by a long war that lasted for more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and secure, due to the progress achieved in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew areas ravaged by terrorists in order to bring the situation back to normal.
All conditions are now provided for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to abandon due to terrorism and the unilaterally introduced economic measures that affected their daily and life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime welcomed aid in the restoration of the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept parole or assistance from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe hits substantial Raider Cup win in Paris
The team of Europe beat the United States team in the 2018 Raider Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in "Le Golf National", outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six straight in the European field and has not won the title of the Raider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the primate after Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points that were needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mikkelson who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, led the ball into the water into the pair-3 in the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari took note in all laps, becoming one of the four players who scored 5-0-0-0 after the tournament began to be organised in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost with a score of 5:4 from the European team's lowest ranked player, Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranked player lost 2 and 1 to Ian Polter of England, who may have last played on the Raider Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Raider Cups, became the european who won the most titles in the tournament with a 25.5 points won during his career.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't stop.
This year was really difficult.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the title back.
Teamplay is the most important and I am happy that I could have helped," said the emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He now gave away his fellow John Ram, who on Sunday one to one beat Tiger Woods, American golf legend, by a score of 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost in all four matches in France and now has a 1321-3 career record in the Raider Cup.
It is the amazing statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking for Jack Niclaus.
The United States team worked all weekend to direct the game to low grass courts, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finalu, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furick said after his team's disappointing game "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
At one point this morning, we gave the team a hard time from Europe.
We fought.
A hat downstairs for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the Association of Professional Golfers of America and our Raider Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it to them.
They outplayed us.
