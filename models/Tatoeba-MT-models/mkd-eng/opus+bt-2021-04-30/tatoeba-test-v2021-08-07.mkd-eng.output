I read his book.
I read Tom a story.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like this wine.
I love your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I'd love to learn French very much.
It would be really nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the queen.
I despise his harsh attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I got one.
Iron is tougher than gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring him in.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is something wrong?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying facility.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him over there.
I saw my sister break the letter.
I just didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far?
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are the potatoes caloric?
I don't see any conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Is everyone happy?
Is everyone having fun?
Is everything there?
Are you breathing?
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
I've been shaking my head.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I need to feel sorry for them.
I should take her home.
I need to pack.
I should go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more polite.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed her my room.
Is it cold out there?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Daddyba really very slow today, or does she seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I put a slap on him.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a throat.
I slept in the shun.
I slept on a bus.
Nacoso cut the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I'm smiling.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this the previous time?
I kind of like it.
It's been all day cleaning up snow.
Is she a cabbie?
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I found something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
That means "yes" or "no"?
Is that word even there?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that Sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you won't help him?
Is that why you won't help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge secure?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house done?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paid for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is this diamond real?
Is that moral?
Is this correct in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place available?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your purse?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Is Tom contributing?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom fun?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did Tom talk to you?
Is Tom alone in there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm learning a history of art.
Suddenly I felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
I need you to lean down.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I suspected.
I think Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't mess with you if you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I spoke to my advisors about what items to take.
It all makes sense.
Everything looks pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
So, no, no, no.
It can't be!
It concerns you.
It was a lot more than I expected.
Never, never really, could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It would be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappointed him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It won't get any better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; either way you have to.
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't seem to be helping.
Doesn't sound like who knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm teaching him English.
I'm so sorry.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do with.
It had to be done.
It's got to be made from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
She's getting out.
It happens.
It's cooled off.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy.
It has sentimental value.
I mean it all day long.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think she's right.
I think he's hiding something.
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I better help him.
I think I better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see what it's like.
I think I love you.
I think I've made a nice plea.
I think I'm pretty good at writing.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom some money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel is gonna be a little expensive.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's callous.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's tiny.
I think Tom's a plapidlak.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's a bit of a screw-up.
I think Tom's vain.
I think Tom's resourceful.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going to go.
I think we can get him.
I think it's better if we don't drink the water.
We better not go out on a storm like this.
I think we're going to join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done here.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've had enough.
I think we found one.
I think it worked.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you're familiar with the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what interests me.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're overdoing the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you're gonna help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've been living in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you need to deal with this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I meant you.
I thought she had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was seeing things.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom went well.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
So didn't we get along?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you'll have work to do.
So you didn't want the prize, did you?
I thought you found another one.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
Well, don't you hate him?
She seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls lower than you.
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
Well, didn't you say you could swim?
Well, didn't you say you wanted to go with us?
I thought you were better at playing chess than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
It hurts like hell in here.
Mary gets annoyed when Tom leaves the toilet lid up.
It's a multiphase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance of doing the job in one day.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It's out of the question.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get into our heads that we can't outrun nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a familiar passage of his essay.
He's writing to his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It seems kind of wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
Happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be Christmas soon.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
You looked funny.
I guess you're right.
It looks very delicious.
It looks different.
It seems familiar.
It looks like an egg.
It looks like I drank too much yesterday, and my head shoots, and I'm so hung over.
These two seem to be back in a relationship.
These two seem to have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks good.
That's how I got close to Tom.
It's combing me out.
It's ringing me.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a proposition, but it was an order.
It might rain tonight.
Maybe he's acting weird.
It might be a long time before you ever see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom it wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it would be hard to pull off.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen.
I told you this was going to get sick.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I took a shower.
I took the bus back.
I took Tom to lunch.
I broke my pants.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
Probably won't be worth waiting.
It was raining two days ago.
He's been working through a lot of difficulties.
I tried to explain it to him, but not a bastard.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I sincerely regret that.
I trust the teacher.
I try not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
It's about to rain.
It's a classic.
It was a real disaster!
It is recommended to check if there can be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while drinking the medication they prescribed for you.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over for us.
It's all over now.
That's all they talk about.
Everything's so weird.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's almost out of here.
It's so funny.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
That's an insignificant mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake lead.
It's a risky plan.
Too bad concrete doesn't burn.
We're getting on foot fast.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They took it apart.
You've caused me nothing but trouble.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is incredibly warm.
It would be best if you didn't talk that much.
You better be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and deceive than to be pessimistic and to be right.
"You die on your feet rather than live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's a new rookie.
You scared me.
There's nobody here.
It's closing time.
Colds here.
It's commonly known you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in prison than then run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I got it wrong.
It looks like her style.
It seems to me that it is the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's the way you're supposed to be.
It's evil to curse.
It's ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's just.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
It's clouded.
It's getting darker.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be beastly.
It's gonna get even cooler.
It'll happen soon enough.
It's nice to see you all again.
That's good practice.
It's good.
It's improved.
It's so much fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
What matters to me is what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
She's in great condition.
It's in a basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just made up.
Just sit tight.
It's a little forward.
It's locked.
It's made of skin.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's no big deal.
It's no big deal.
It's noisy in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That doesn't make a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
It didn't happen that way.
It will not be easy to do so without much help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
It's not necessary.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
Not often does one buy a thousand dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds really cool.
Sounds really good.
It's our job to help them.
It's totally white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
It's probably still available.
It's flat.
It's actually quite common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's entirely possible that Tom doesn't help us at all.
It's pretty simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really nasty.
It's a shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
It's so cool!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark out there.
It's still for sale.
It's still running.
It hasn't gone down yet.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
Strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's bitten by a spider.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
Time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too striking.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in place of their choice.
It's so cool.
It's bullshit.
It's totally wrong.
This heat doesn't last.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom immediately.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to grasp.
It's hot in here.
No matter what, I guess.
There's wind.
It's work.
You lose.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
The water only takes three minutes to boil.
It's been going on all night.
It lasted a lot more than I thought it would last.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
It turns out you're unexpectedly irrevocable.
I turned on the fan and I laid it against the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a talk.
It was so beautiful.
That was a disgrace.
It was after midnight.
This has been an arena day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was okay here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an amazing evening.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It represented a debt that I spent the evening with a smart, funny, and beautiful girl like you.
It was a remarkable experience.
It was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a hard test.
It was a hot night.
It was a beautiful day.
It's been a great day.
It's been a wonderful evening.
Such behavior was childish on his part.
It was nasty.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was from them.
Yesterday was fun.
She was sleeping.
He was stinking.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit that I had made a mistake.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty gross.
It has been shown that the fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those living on cats.
It was so magnificent.
That was pretty funny.
It was really cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really moving.
It was blowing up a lot.
It was remarkable.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
It was so obvious.
It was fierce.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was hung on the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was inevitable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very suffrage in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Bether.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
It won't help any lies.
That's not gonna help.
He's doing a good job.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch up with you to explain everything.
I need you here urgently.
I used to look after you.
I used to dream of becoming a ballet dancer.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything I needed to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always had to not say too much.
I've always had someone help me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked her a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I've been a little on edge with something else.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
It's been a lot worse.
I was betrayed.
I've been notified.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I wasn't.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I was gone for three weeks.
I was happy here.
I was helping her.
I've been giving them help.
They hired me to find them.
I've been kidnapped.
I've lived here for many years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I've been busy enough.
I've been looking for you for a while.
I've studied French since I was thirteen.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I've watched it so far.
I came for them.

We're back together.
We're bankrupt.
We're being childish.
We've been subverted.
We're being cheated.
We're paranoid.
We're both from Boston.
We're busy now.
We're investigating the entire area.
We're worried about him.
We're worried about them.
We're done talking.
We're eating apples.
We're calling her.
We're calling him.
We have experience.
We fly over the clouds.
We're lucky.
We're glad you're here.
We'll be fine.
We're gonna find her.
We're going to pick them up.
We'll have company.
We're here to help.
We're still warming up.
We're lazy.
We're leaving Boston.
We're like brothers.
Now we're looking for them.
They're the ones we're looking for.
We're models.
We're not gonna let you die.
We're not free.
We're not bad people, Tom.
We're not criminals.
We're not done.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
We don't hang out.
We won't find them.
We're not invited.
We have not yet escaped the danger.
We're not safe here.
We're not looking.

Aren't you going to leave?
Wasn't he tired?
We're good.
We're old friends.
We're on our way to Boston.
We ran out of gas.
We don't need any drama.
We're exaggerated.
We're playing on a computer.
We're playing with the computer.
We're pretty good.
We're probably just kidding each other.
We're ready to fight.
If you're ready to go, so are we.
We're very angry.
We're really good.
We're in real danger.
We're too fine.
We're sorry.
We'll stay.
We're the best.
We're playing with fate.
We're the champions.
Were there any survivors?
We're Tom's parents.
We're trying to help him.
We'll turn around.
We're very effective.
We're very pleased.
We're wasting time.
We're depending on work.
Are you scared?
Were you home at ten?
Was she one of them?
We're your neighbors.
Was he honest?
Was he sympathetic?
Did you see that?
Were you with anyone?
We wrapped the carpet.
We sat and waited.
We should ask him.
We should ask them.
We both should go.
We should do this again sometime.
We should give him some time.
We need to give Tom a chance to confess.
We should go home.
We need to help them.
We should let Tom get back to work.
We shouldn't have let her go.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
We need to set a trap.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
We should have quit early.
We slept in a tent.
We spent the afternoon fooling around at the beach.
We started talking.
We're gone.
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
We still need a plan.
We still want to help.
We stole it.
We talked until two hours.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to get them to come.
We tried to get them to tell us.
We were trying to hide it.
We understand that.
We appreciate our customers.
None of us were right.
We've all read that.
We've already cleared that up.
We baked their cakes.
That's where we started.
We're expecting her.
We've been looking for them.
We've been through a lot.
They lied to us.
We tried.
We've been waiting.
We've been worried.
We've both seen it.
We discussed this.
We did everything we could for her.
There's a big day tomorrow.
We have one rule here.
We have something to show you.
We have the key.
We have to find him first.
We have to find him.
We have to find them first.
We need to get him into bed.
We have to put them in bed.
We have to give them something.
We have to help her.
We have to try it.
We had meetings.
We humiliated Tom.
We've lost faith in humanity.
We made mistakes.
We've met a few times.
We only met once.
We've seen aliens.
We visited Loara's castles.
We were waiting outside.

We want more money.
We want to be famous.
We want to hear it.
We want to help him.
We want to help them.
We want to know about them.

We want to see Tom.
We got out of there at eleven o'clock.
We went to pick strawberries.
We went to the same church.
We were all rooting for her.
We were all shocked.
We've both been busy.
We didn't even have a broken money.
We were completely confused.
We were then eighteen years old.
We would hang them.
We had a fight.
We were in a hurry.
That's when we got here.
We just got out of there.
We've been looking for you.
We didn't fight.
We weren't hungry.
There were so many more of them than we did.
We were passengers.
We played golf.
We were ready.
We were very close.
The bell saved us.
We were so worried.
We were so young back then.
We're the first ones here.
We were under attack.
We were worried about you.
We're going to have a discussion about the forecast.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
We'd have fun going to the party.

That's what you said an hour ago.

You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
I guess you already know the answer.
You look like you're cold.

You should write Tom a letter of thanks.
You stink of shit.
You sound like it made you feel better.
You sound so sure.
You've twisted your ankle.
You're beautiful.
You really talk a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You only think she's weird because she's not white.
You traitor!
You two are so cute together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're back.
They've got you drunk.
You've been in a car accident, but you're gonna be fine.

You've got me all wrong.
I promise.
You do now, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
I made Tom miserable.
You jumped one button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been putting this off for too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
You were lucky he survived the attack.
You were wrong.
It's not like you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He drove fast.
You were great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the painting.
You will do as I command you.
You'll find your toys and your books.
You're not gonna need that.
You won't make it.
You won't win.
You worry too much about him.
I wouldn't want you to be late.
Yeah, I'm angry.
