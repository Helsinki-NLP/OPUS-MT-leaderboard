It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How do they treat you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take time.
Why don't you go after him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're cold.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the bike?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom doesn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We only met once.
Thanks for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's quit them.
How much is it worth?
The water was up to our heads.
Tom pretended he didn't notice Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you trust me, Tom?
Tom is not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still got it.
You looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
Nobody knows this.
The drain was cracked.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've watched it so far.
You chose well.
The Nudists consider nudity to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
Wolves stalked the herd.
That song haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll make it.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you fired a gun before?
I like that tattoo a lot.
You got a ticket for nothing.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you later?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they done so far?
Tom is a childless man.
I don't live in Boston.
They were suing the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a warranty.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did what Mary told him to do.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for that job is high.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom's aware that he wasn't a good father so he's trying to redeem himself.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have something to confess.
The alcohol affected him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looks around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little cold in the cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would've answered.
I'm in debt to help him.
He's critical.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spits out the gum.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to have a picnic with John.
Don't be so hard on me.
I think it worked.
We didn't come from monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It's been going on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too hot for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rough.
Sounds like Tom.
No one judges you.
Stop bringing it down tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom later had breakfast.
Are you helping her?
Are you two related?
He likes ham with eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take a subway than take a train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle it?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Have you done your best?
Mary rewinded the film.
She has a nice manuscript.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote this report himself.
Do you buy one of these?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can I have that back?
That was personal.
I better go, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
Acting is very good.
Please, don't mummlay.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at him.
We better not go out on a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Should we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you do it the other way around?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know that Tom and Mary had been married before.
Would you like to sing?
You're lucky.
I've been running my nose every time I'm cold.
We've met a few times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in such a way that you'll understand.
Everyone's looking for luck.
Did anyone else get into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom was terribly involved with me in high school.
Tom wore a cap that still stood the price.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
You have to make a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree to that.
Tom would lend you money if he asked.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open up?
Mike said he'd be here.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're cannibals.
Don't make a man with a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run!
Is it paid for the delivery?
I want a repeat.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
Komarci carry malaria.
You've been putting this off for too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry.
I think I know how to find him.
We get checks, too.
This newspaper cost a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You got one.
The Macedonian has four verbiistic ways: a testimony, a conditional, a commandary and resold.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected her features as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right.
I don't have a gun.
I need clearance.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw trash on the ground.
I remember meeting the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom looked furious.
What will the Japanese economy be like next year?
That's exactly how I got in trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think of myself.
I was trying to find him.
It's a big house for us.
It's a children's game.
Tom, you don't give a shit.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom fucking got me.
I was only gone for an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The play must go on.
You made a scandal out of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't draw attention.
I almost fainted.
Pick your favorite bat.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We ran out of gas.
Tom is a tralaika.
Who you got on the list?
He's got a hell of an alibi.
Look in the mirror, bro.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought flowers to Mary?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Should I go with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things that Tom complained about was food.
Make sure you don't get in the mud.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary did not wash dishes.
We weren't waiting for them.
Are the meals involved in the price?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the fateful day they'll try to escape.
Everyone's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's totally wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom the police have already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you won't help him?
Tom's got a rose in his room.
There are no survivors.
She was supposed to be quiet.
I'm not like you!
"You die on your feet rather than live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I put a slap on him.
Tom's not alone.
Tom should take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do it.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was particularly troubled at giving speeches, due to the heavy speaking manna.
She did not accept the invitation.
Tom looked surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is defective.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried to sink the submarine for nothing.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in prison than then run away.
You're covered.
When do you learn?
Tom found it hard to swallow the pills.
It is worth quoting a familiar passage of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right on that.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Why don't you take a walk?
Don't overeat yourself.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Take off the clamp.
I don't have any plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
So you didn't want the prize, did you?
Watch the game.
I'm glad you're glad.
They're insincere.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at this bright star.
I don't know how to help him.
Buckle up.
Make him confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory sucks.
We're bankrupt.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you just help me out a little bit?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the lights.
When are you supposed to renew your passport?
Mary has no courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not even a hint of height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Have them call me.
A beam of electricity warms the ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have money.
Dan came to see us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the forest, monkeys came down from the crossroads.
Let's forget about it for now.
Due to his father's sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're receiving data quickly.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize it all.
I don't know.
I couldn't stand him at first.
His sleeve's hanging.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
They all left except for him.
Tom is here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting darker.
Pipes are dead.
I've offended you, haven't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
She's acting like she's next to him.
Tom is not a vegetarian.
I think she's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I died.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do it.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
You need to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
I'm afraid you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How's that your fault?
Tom had a bottle of wine.
I fell off a bike.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does this play start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks broke.
Tom talked Mary into donating money.
I got him with me.
Isn't your name Cooky the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel so good today!
Tom didn't approve the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with it.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multiphase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom ran down the alley.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Mustard really heat.
We market our products on television.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom is too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
You hit me in the head.
Is anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they said no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30.
She's almost out of here.
You should try this.
I'm expecting a call from them.
They've blocked it.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.
I just fired them.
That was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom put his hands out.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says that the previous dentist told him that he would remove the stains from nicotine if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your opinions.
It was Tom who suggested it.
It seems kind of wrong.
Tom's a smart guy.
The powdered carrito is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It's been a hard night for me.
Tom drove through town with a raised brake without noticing.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you like camping?
Who broke the toilet?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't mean to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Save it for yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be rolling over in a grave right now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, not realizing that their own behavior is also undesirable.
He's wearing high heels to make himself taller.
Do you like bowling?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
All you need to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I like to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
I don't pet.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What does it matter?
We meet at last, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're so stubborn.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used indecent terms.
The coffee's giving you energy!
Tom was a nice man.
It's a big gauge for football.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom writes skillfully.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to let the idea go.
Tom's really upset.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as repellent.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose squad is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes lit with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible that Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve everything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, so are we.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "Me too."
There's a lot of birds in these woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
He was just about to meet me, Tom.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible that Tom is richer than we thought.
I never meant to fool you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that kind of wish.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
You apologized.
I can't find the hotel address.
Smoking means suicide.
The turrets, butterflies, and roaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to bring you this as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom took his knee.
Where do the pyñols come from?
Can I talk to you upstairs?
It's made of skin.
I have to rest.
Can I look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took his coat off.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom performed, and the crowd clapped.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but it didn't work.
Dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink sodas.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really moving.
Get her inside.
You cook a turkey with pears.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going what he wants it to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking overkilled.
I know how it sounds.
Tom seemingly didn't mind sitting alone.
I'm feeling a lot better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My father used to take me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try and find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm in love.
Tom arrived early.
He dried his wet clothes by the fire.
He always fins himself with his knowledge of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have covers?
No part of the pig failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom packed his bags.
What good does that do?
That's very useful.
Tom had his phone vibrated.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I was doing last night.
The girl was walking slow.
It turns out you're unexpectedly irrevocable.
Your prejudices save you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing facts.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room is packed.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't contain himself.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That doesn't make a big priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You won't make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know that I would do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
It's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works at the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems cheerful.
Tom's not very young.
There's a phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda had a sickness and suspected that she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 before the main gate.
The meeting began over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know and do.
I have money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom fixed everything.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't go cocous.
It's not safe for me here.
To my great grief, Mary came to the party in an fornicator's dress.
I'll say whatever you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get together.
Beekeepers remove the honeycomb to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
Nickad I won't forget.
Tom won the fight.
Bring them here right now.
Tom lives abroad.
Is this where they work?
Tom had his eyes flashed when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you help us at all?
It might be a long time before you ever see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't look possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many major cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom likes us to think he's richer than he actually is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than it seems.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got a lot of problems.
This isn't blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs usually kill them before they're a year old, so they eat people.
Could you get this arrow out of my leg?
I've forgotten how smart you can be.
Can I see that?
He spends his money without water.
We don't need anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not really convinced.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times you shouldn't overdo it.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
This book weighs heavily.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just saying be careful.
Tom keeps lying to me.
The rooms in this hotel are obviously very bad at quelling sounds.
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's walk through the market!
Try to be an optimist.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the keyhole.
Watch us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Do you know what I mean?
Please talk to me.
Angels guard us and lead us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Therapy didn't help.
My grace is weak.
Tom stood at his disposal.
Tom's going into town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
It's a yave.
Who saw me?
Tom's closing in.
Tom is the real hero.
Where did he come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
That did the job.
These goats are mischievous.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't think for a second that he'd try to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Should I use this pen?
Tom washs his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom sleeps hard.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He was standing in front of her.
There are more exits.
Tom has always been very protective of his children.
I asked her the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen tissues.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I have not yet found time to write that account.
I can do it without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
It's clouded.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't have been prevented.
I love walking by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Come down.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nodded.
I don't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm thirty years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you should hear it.
Do you know how to dive?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
What about a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the squads.
It was a terrible sight.
Dunn's knife was overslept with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
Today at noon we will eat cherry from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
That's a tough bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I was gone for three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sun cream.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsocial.
It's good for me tonight.
They were traveling east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The ceramics that fell from the roof were torn apart.
Who is the owner of this estate?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the tub.
Come by anytime.
Tom would have thrown us out.
Tom didn't get embarrassed.
I'm just completing my report.
Come on, hurry up, it's urgent.
You better go.
Tom missed the exit.
I have two apparatuses.
What were you up to?
Dan admitted to Linda that he was a heavy drunk.
That's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom dropped his drink.
They stole my wallet on a bus.
Don't argue with me.
It's kind of hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not here for you.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary yelling.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amoes are life-forms.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't mean Tom's dead.
Waves create the wind.
Get a clean glass from the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a possibility they'll kill.
I left her a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like how French write their word for "bubamara".
The lift can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think too risky without any help.
Are you good at that?
We're pretty good.
Pig's been cut on dice and fried.
Ask a professional face.
I love travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom found it difficult to deal with Mary.
Tom was seemingly trying to convince Mary to take action.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom erased his forehead.
This book is not yet translated into French.
Tom's here.
Gangsters suffered a large sum of money from the wealthy.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
A conscience bites you, doesn't it?
I coughed up blood.
I need a minute.
The main city of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his hand.
Get a tissue, your nose's running.
Tom was going with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just need to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think it was gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
If only you'd stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom stopped me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did this happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still dressed in pajamas and bathrobe when I got here this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're back.
The sentence is not exact grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can walk.
I was invited to their wedding.
Any more questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of town.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is precise and that her results are more indistinguishable.
I've tried.
A broken tree interfered with the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts failed.
Math is doing its best.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
He put his head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom likes to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
You hurt me and you called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's vain.
Some fish can change their gender.
I can take it from her.
Get some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do it.
Makes us work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants every wedding to be the groom and every funeral the deceased.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom was not surprised when he saw Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They're offering free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not native to semistrove.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom is never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom drew a pen.
Why should I be interested in what you're doing?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long should this drug be taken?
I don't need a bed.
Get us a face-to-face on Facebook!
Did you get us something?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy do not write down their happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.
I need to paint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm teaching him English.
What is usually the cause of the pain?
We're depending on work.
This box is made of tin.
She failed the test for a reason.
Trust your intuition.

Just try it.
I wanna play, too.

Is Tom interested?
Here it is.
I want to talk to you about Tom.
Tom is not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We had turtle soup.
We can work out in the open if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's jewels.
That cake is caloric.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I blame Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
They've told me you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
What's wrong with her?
It's not usually a pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
We'll get paid well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I got hit by a car.
I'm no wiser.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of my day here.
Should we wait here for her?
If you go out like that, you'll catch cold.
Does it still hurt?
That was pretty funny.
I set him up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say anything?
Is everyone busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's forgive this.
Tom got shot.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom did not resist.
We were doing a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Pass me the wine.
All the stores are closed.
You've made white again!
Stop sucking your dick.
Tom's done with the dishes.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
We don't need any drama.
We believe in God.
We have to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go alone.
I was the one who dug up this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom agree with his associates?
That smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is an adult responsible.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I've forgiven you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
What's a shortcut from?
Thanks again for coming.
We're being cheated.
The wounded soldier barely walked.
The sun's just up.
I actually know the answer to that question.

Tom takes down movies a lot.
I was beautiful.

The light is rejected by water.
Tom spilled the soup.
I'm not fucking you.
You can ask Tom.

Return to your seats.
Can I touch you?
Anything wrong with you?
Sit down a man to cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We went in the trees.
Anyway, I'll do it.
I knew you'd side with Tom.
He couldn't avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too striking.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom acted like a cavalier.
Now we're even with him.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more polite.
Have fun with Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This is a perfect pass.
He was watering his garden with a hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give any gift to Tom.
Tom was industrious.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He went down the alley.
Should I make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's take a look.
The European likes to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He's got a lot of debt.
She knows the bigger capitals.
What's under the covers?
Nobody wants to play with her.
Tom's giving everyone a drink.
Are you ready to go?
Tom's obviously out of his mind.
Tom approached them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom certainly didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary prided herself on her glige.
Teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rough.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I have my passport.
It was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she'll be back.
I don't have any pen.
When are we supposed to start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you embarrassed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship sank without fail.
Did you buy the cure?
Has Tom been drinking?
My work hurts.
The question is who will do it.
I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Is everyone happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy pisses me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would really like to see you.
I was wrong at all.
Please ask me anything.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
How do you look?
Tom is a Wunderkind.
He's walking to school.
It's starting to get into our heads that we can't outrun nature.
I don't understand why you won't help.
Tom seems very arrogant.
Now the question is, what do we have to do?
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He finished fourth of 56 runners.
I don't pet.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he was obsessed with the girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom broke Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what you were looking for.
I'll be in my chamber.
They didn't act quickly.
I'm weak.
A pair of wool sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever, unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to hang out with Tom.
They'll never let you into that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is Tom looking for them?
There's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are threatened.
Tom made a proposition.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned around to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom's done.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We've heard carefully so we don't miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell backward.
We're exaggerated.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house done?
Tom's vices are hilarious, and they get even better once he drinks a few beers.
You've got million eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yes, yes, it will... when the willow will give birth to grapes.
Tom's an advisor.
Can I talk to you?
You offended me by calling me a donkey.
Since when have there been fireworks?
It's possible that Tom is lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing as you.
I didn't give anything away.
Just yesterday I thought of you.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
I'm losing my hair.
The big question that no one has ever found an answer, including me, despite thirty years of researching a woman's soul, is "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
Villagers reap harvest.
Tom's not gonna like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the break-in?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the object?
At each part, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you sick of me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom seems ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was hilarious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer can also scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that painting is.
Everyone's up.
Money is not the criterion for success.
I want to know when it's your birthday.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Hold my luck!
The concert ended with the folk anthem.
We've been looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not going to move.
Wait a second.
I have something to do with.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He was running as fast as he could.
I won.
Each shade is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
No comment.
I think he's hiding something.
I hope there's a fair amount of air here.
She married a man for zero.
The wind's down.
Nothing has changed.
You don't need to wear anything like this.
The old man is subverted before death.
I don't like this book.
I'm lucky to have.
What would Tom be looking for that for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I caught measles.
Can anyone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you Google her?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is settled.
Tom was admitted to a hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, there's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's true to me.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
The one who can hear the butterflies laughing knows what the clouds taste like.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't deal with them.
They drew lots to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar isn't about eating like goods!
But if I was in Brazil, I'd be so much more afraid.
Have you worked as a bartender before?
Have you forgotten that again?
I don't like it at all.
I've just finished my work hours.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food has cooled, heat it up in the microwave.
The creek is right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
This guy's a bandit.
It's possible that Tom saw it.
Tom's a little limp.
Tom is very immature.
What are you up to?
How is the volume of a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's drunk.
I got your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom put a fork in the socket.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are a species of mammals.
Dan waved Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shaken up.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, and you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
It's about to rain.
This will make our work considerably easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He has wine.
His feelings were not returned.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably just kidding each other.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you want to know, let me know, so I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
I'm good at it.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family, like myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I've got a bunch of questions.
Who runs things here?
I've heard so much about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Each nation has its own language.
I would never take it.
It's gonna get even cooler.
What are you drinking?
The way it came - the way it went.
His legs ran out.
Tom picked up his keys.
It's all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The significance of music is underrated.
Can you show me this place on map?
Tom's unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went on a pilgrimage.
Look forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom bothering you?
This is my latest draw.
I've been out of it for two days.
It's corny, it bends too easily.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Coming out of the rain doesn't come into consideration.
I'll tell them to go now.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
I got asal.
A living soul wasn't in town.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom shot Mary with a rotten egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you even doing here?
Don't despair.
I like watching lesbian porn.
And who the hell are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that admin on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom was worried right now.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already do.
She's writing her mother a letter.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
The boy found it impossible to swim the river.
Tom was here earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old cabin has a certain charm.
This subject is taboo.
We barely made it.
Did they hire you?
It's leaking gas.
Tom could see Mary was texting.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little freaked out.
Let's do this right.
In Hawaii you can cruise for a year.
Tom was motivated.
You may have to help us.
Most feel that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Dude, you can't just approach a woman and crush her - that counts as sexual harassment.
I've decided to tell her I love him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You lose.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom is seated.
You can't do what you think you do.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I go on?
It was blowing up a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That's not what's happening here.
It is better to be optimistic and deceive than to be pessimistic and to be right.
The water was lukewarm.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
The boy was silent.
The ship's hull is divided into more water-prospersing parts.
Since you cooked, I'll be washing dishes.
Let's leave this matter to ourselves.
Tom knows something he doesn't tell us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose a condition.
It's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear a knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, yeah!"
He's not the shy boy he used to be anymore.
Contach?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We've got a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to grasp.
There were boys everywhere divided into groups, some playing marbles, some tablets, some with a ball, some riding a bike or riding wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed in.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk left in the bottle.
We both should go.
The pain that causes love is sweeter than any pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You miscalculated her.
Let me check the manual.
Energy comes from the inside.
No one believed them.
Tom did not accept Mary's apology.
He punched his head.
We're gone.
Put the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom carrying?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This is not normal.
Can I talk to you tomorrow?
Tom is cooling up.
I don't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
It's less wet today than yesterday.
Making new friends is hard for me.
Strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't determine who wants the baby, because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I gotta go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom was caught by a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim has never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a fake lead.
Tom fought.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Somebody's singing.
Can you fix a toilet?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're Russian?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Its skirts have pins on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom hurt his leg.
Go inside.
Tom and I made a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one went with me.
I know Tom's gonna be out of jail eventually.
The most expensive thing is land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is acidic.
We've run out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why do you oppose it?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'm going to ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Count on how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much is that one over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Do you get up at six o'clock?
Tom sat down again.
What state is Boston in?
Tom is very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had burned on my lungs, I was just combing into my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me now.
My cat's happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard exactly.
Tom's got a headache.
Hey, let's not.
There's nobody here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did his best.
He's a greedy man.
First of all, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
Mom buys me a toy.
I won't take that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm impressed, Tom.
Tom's an errand boy.
Tom can't hear us.
They want what you told them you'd give them.
Tom wrote stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's been decided?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
Better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well dried up.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe it'd be best if you called them.
Some people like it.
In accordance with our deal, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What do I have to do with this?
Is your dog barking?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German donuts.
We were then eighteen years old.
I make thirteen bucks an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I love brucule but I hate carphiol.
I don't give a shit when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran.
Get on with it.
This is disgusting.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he doesn't know what Mary wants him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
Is Tom hurt?
They've got you drunk.
Tom began to complain.
I think you should choose her.
They're comfortable.
You're blind.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out your candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom had a rough look at Mary.
Tom was wearing a hoodie.
Tom seems determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you done already?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, preferably.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joker.
It's been a lot worse.
Tom went to great lengths to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be dead.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I only drank one glass.
Nobody's writing to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to talk with his mouth full.
Everyone was in control.
Each customer has its own rights.
I'm just calling to hear you out.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What was the last thing you did?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
This statement is flawed: I go to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little bit.
Who's Dunn talking to?
They cursed us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his father at all.
Tom's not exactly a threat.
It was after midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Have you changed your shampoo?
Tom was looking around, you didn't expect anything to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's hot in here, so you can take your coat off.
I don't think I've been followed.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom is very pessimistic.
You're right on one phone call.
Skiing was actually much more fun than I was expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go back home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get that guy.
I do my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to crash.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.

Tom greased his toast with butter.
We have work to do.

Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there, on a hill.
I'll take whatever it was.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the children alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It's gonna be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom was seemingly used to problems like this.
You'll be fine.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on my mustache.
He rarely went there.
Tom's stiff.
Let's sing and dance.
After war, the winners are always right, and the defeated are the guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translating jokes is rather difficult, if at all can be said to be possible.

Oversow the weakness.
How many pushups a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
You don't happen to have a key?
Let's be realistic.
Tea with a lemon, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him just as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came in and found me, his whole body was bleeding to alcohol.
Tom's naked.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is heavy.
I'm not leaving with Tom.
Was she one of them?
He's got a little fit.
I'll make sure we finish this project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
The music is universal.
You push too much when you shake hands.
And if we don't?
Don't let me come after you, Tom.
He won first place in the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan smoked marijuana with Linda.
Tom often takes a walk before dinner.
Yesterday she stayed up late.
You're disgusting.
Everyone was quiet.
What exactly happened between us?
What's wrong?
You gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
Maybe he's acting weird.
No one can save himself from death.
That's not gonna help.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom's been in trouble many times.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?

When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
I got this song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.

Save Tom.

I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one's gonna find me.

Don't be longer than five minutes.

How can you help her?

I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not exactly old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Kids need love.
It's his job.
If only I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.

You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You've got to clean up the kid.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm feeling a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's sledge.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always cheers me up.
I hear they pay pretty good.
Tom was a fun character.
Did you get something to eat?
Boston is a wonderful city.
Look at me.
How many gallons of oil does it fit in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
It's possible there's another world out there.
We have nothing you want.
This pear is green.
Tom recalled what he told Mary.
Go find him.
It's in a basement.
Tom's freaking out.
I get you.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'm gonna scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom combed his hair.
Everybody sat down.
He gently touched her.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't like walking.
He looks a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
Let's get started.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobbies do you have?
So, I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a letter of thanks.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light faded.
Come on!
And if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan walks his little dog.
It had to be done.
I flipped the lamp.

I'm not sure that's exactly what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's testimony.
That's close.
We were worried about you.
Experience does not inherit - each acquires its own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
This takenina is greatly stretched when it is washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I blame him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom started talking.
I got out of class.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
No bait, it's gonna be hard for me to fish.
Tom was napping.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion matters.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs both his help.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom seems confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep as a abyss.

I think Tom's hurt.

Everyone has drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a stern critic.
I've cured my cold with this cure.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?

Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a good place.
I've got a lot to do.
I came here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim, because it was cold weather.
It's not necessary.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom wears new shoes.
I'll make the call.
We don't make it this way to Tom's house.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom's out.
Please repeat.
You're very dramatic.
Tom's covered.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She went to school.
They say Maria Antoinette was responsible for the French revolution.
My family starts where your family ends.
He's my partner.
That's awesome.
Why don't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
It's so cool!
We're like brothers.
Let me make you something.
You've got too much work to do.
Is that possible, Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I'm a wildling of your boldness.
He was voted mayor of Boston.
The police found shoe prints at the scene.
That's what I asked.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom saved the letter.
Tom would love that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom next to Mary was sitting.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Are we allowed to come?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that Sarcasm?
Tom's a screw-up.
I'm gonna have to try and handle this on my own.
They probed the spaceship.
Tom wrote me over thirty messages yesterday.
Do you know for a fact that this isn't made diamonds?
You let Tom escape.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
You wish you knew.
I looked at her.
A great crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've been living in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is erratic.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm warm.
Tom was a boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.

Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were being chased.
Let's get down the street.
A living soul wasn't in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I don't dig you wells.
I've got a few minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom loves you anyway.
You're a good cook.
There's no shortcut to the top, just to the break-in.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's getting paid a lot.
It was sad.
I can tell you cared about her.
Come dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automobiles are now spread out.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom wears chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's a new rookie.
I waved Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my snack?
The eagle was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you're gonna help me.
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making a kennel.
I want the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take a bribe.
Don't sugar my coffee.
Tom gave her daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with it, it will be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the bagpipes?
They picked her up pretty good.
What does it all mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It represented a debt that I spent the evening with a smart, funny, and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of parental control.
Tom's a punk.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census took place in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said that by texting me at night, but you lied to me, obviously.
Get a guess.
He cut himself to bathe.
A river of sweat began to fall on my face.
Mary gave up moral values and became nihilist.
Let's just let it go.
I'm learning math.
The clavires are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How did you make out?
Movies are a great distraction.
At first, I didn't see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me like jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you plan to leave.
How many guests do we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I got it wrong.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone laughed.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
They canceled our flight due to adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what's the question?
Tom sat there patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They may be back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world shines the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom was all made a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
Don't come out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary likes to have hot coffee, and Tom likes to drink hot coffee.
I gave her a false address.
I took a shower.
I don't see eye to eye anymore.
Chances are Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
What matters to me is what you think of Tom.
They're firing.
Tom's stuck.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'll really try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy it?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How could anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
Everything is quiet again.
That's an insignificant mistake.
I really hope so.
Get out of here.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me now.
Let me help.
Tom's got anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new guy.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether or not he can or not.
Tom ran up.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I've done.
It's still there.
Aren't you gonna eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls lower than you.
I have to tighten my seat belt.
Tom almost collided with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom disobeyed his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Have you spoken to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is not a place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He's seen a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm weaker and weaker.
Thortana looks good.
Has anyone broken your heart?
That's how I feel.
What's wrong with you?
We want to see Tom.
Where were you, Tom?
Who won the award?
Please come on time.
The Germans have a loose attitude towards nudity.
Now we can't help her.
Please don't move.
You can't deny it.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you won't help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a big grave.
Women love men with mustaches.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They're both screaming.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I had no luck.
His body was covered in brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I really pissed Tom off.
The seventh consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anybody.
The island's settlements are friendly.
Let's try it with Tom first.
I've always liked mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to have a pineapple for breakfast.
I meant to tell you.
What's the cap cover?
Tom is one of the most prominent American songwriters.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't leave Tom alone.
Tom might never come back here again.
Nobody likes crying.
He was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the far mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I would if I could.
Tom's a total freak.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We're the first ones here.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's nice to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary very much.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'll be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a quick learner.
We ate a lot of good food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one's gonna bore you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought scented trash bags.
I suffer from asthma.
He became accustomed to working in the garden after two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom caught malaria when he traveled to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where he hid the Tom Diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're very strong.
How come you made such a mistake?
It's a good memory.
Is he allowed to do whatever he wants?
The time has come for us to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is still not quite aware of what happened.
Cocaine is drugs.
This is a little harder.
I guess you already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood plundered the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who's the owner of this ship?
Yeah, and?
I said where's Tom?
It's been a big help.
What do you usually do on your own time?
I'll come and save you.
I've got a dagger in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We got drunk.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a second.
Her long hair was chestnut brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for handles.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
That's where we started.
I didn't mean to boast.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's with the bolt?
I love someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got a couple of donuts.
I'm learning French.
Don't let me see you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
Girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's wits.
We have to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You're not gonna need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wear suits.
The beam is broken.
He's gone.
His clientella consists mostly of poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women love men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around at the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname stands perfectly for him.
Can you make that stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
You took your sword out.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom was reluctant to go.
Tom seems a little depressed this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked a mule.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that subject with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works in a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took his hat off and gave it nicely.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book, I need it again.
Marco thinks he's writing skillfully.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a punk!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's been experimented.
Tom wouldn't give in.
Tom got suspended.
They were smokin'.
He's going to become a teacher.
I have no intention of telling that to Tom.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom looks odd.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think it bothered us?
Maybe we can get help in the nearest village.
We hope she's okay.
You're capable, but you're confused.
He works at an embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
We might get a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's freaking out.
It's work.
We'll figure it out.
Commendations encourage the students to work hard.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom's about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom measures himself on a waga.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom looks a little shaken up.
He's drunk.
I'm just so proud of you.
At the time, the title "lady" was only used for nobility.
Tom has studied French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How to choose a man just one?
I came to feed Tom the fishes.
I'm actually here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on the dirt bed, with a dagger plunged deep into the heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They pay me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She slipped the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your child laugh.
Tom's suggesting that Mary and I are doing something we're cooking.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty lame.
Tom usually wins a fight.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thundering?
Stay out of business and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
You put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy working.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent's unlocked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got out of the couch.
Don't make Tom mad.
I turned on the fan and I laid it against the wall.
This is a home jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's corpse in a shallow grave behind the chaff.
Tom's writing very well.
That's not entirely true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you water.
Let her bark like a dog.
I'm sick of Boston.
Tom had a really bad headache.
As soon as he got naked, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank lent the company $1 million.
I've got a lot more to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the terms?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you and I'll do my best to destroy it.
Play more relaxed.
My son always interrupts me as I speak.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive alone.
It looks like I drank too much yesterday, and my head shoots, and I'm so hung over.
Tom was running.
Tom said he didn't remember the guy's name.
I'll get to your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
Sports interests me.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have a book to lend to me?
Tom was moving waryly.
Just go inside.
He forged a sword of steel.
I moved to a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I told myself.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom is an only child.
The woman calls the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
There were so many more of them than we did.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't trust you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan's freaking out.
I don't even know which one is which.
I don't call them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What are they up to?
I'll have him stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in a hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are the following.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim in.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me in front of the post office.
Which college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't fire my arm.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't fuck with Tom.
It was a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
A blood vessel burst into my eye.
Tam visited Mary yesterday.
You overdid it!
He's got a son who's missing.
I'm trying to work.
What flavor do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the play will give up; they haven't sold anything much cards.
Tom's coming.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl's asleep.
Go do your homework.
Do not force a child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're funny.
Tom paid me.
It's a measure for me to read books.
He was executed.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom's acting silly.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Give me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone's got their own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What are we doing with them?
Tom knew what Mary was planning to cook for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I get the impression it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful to you.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase less than I did, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live at all?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in this orange.
Tom's here to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cooky.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he was going to water the garden.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please do not add comments.
It was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you wore when I met you?
Lightning usually accompany lightning.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I go with Tom?
Tom seems nervous.
I have a little fever.
Tom put it on the ground.
This lecture doesn't end!
The cups are in the cup cabinet.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to make out with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while you're driving a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom is British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm just as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the psychiatrist.
How come you're not sleeping yet?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the guts to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the waste.
We've both seen it.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I've made a nice plea.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the watch.
Isn't this the previous time?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Is that what you're thinking about?
Actually, I'm back in touch with my ex-boyfriend.
Just get this thing done.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he could play tennis, but he didn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What's the sign over the door?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way she holds her head remind me of Maria.
Don't interfere with my path.
Now we're looking for them.
I've had my shoes soaked.
Tom would have fought back.
She always works hard.
What state are you on?
The ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm meeting Tom.
I prefer cat dogs.
There is still little space in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom is the father.
You know what I need.
This heat doesn't last.
These two seem to have calmed down.
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
I need you here urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I made this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
That's not how I wanted it.
Did Tom do something?
I see you're awake.
Get on with your work.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a recluse, you can say.
Unable to handle this assignment.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go looking for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I understood nothing.
I went to a bath with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We do almost everything together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary yelling at John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits long.
Go with the stables.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchens.
Many people in Africa died as a consequence of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'm gonna get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought she had bigger tits.
Maybe soon I'll be ready to go.
Tom can't feel it.
There's some more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car another time.
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
The noise was annoying.
This is justifiable.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know things.
Was It All Just a Dream?
I can't sleep, I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me at the beach.
Tom changed into a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is Tom like that?
I'm having trouble with sinus.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's running out of water.
Esperanto belongs to no one.
She skillfully handles a saw.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any Internet site.
He left the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I've got three turrets.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
He is slowly recovering from his illness.
I want a tern.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really furious.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get to Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them might be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's on the ceiling.
Her face was covered in sperm.
Tom is fair.
You should do this first.
We met around noon.
Nothing's been done to me tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so he was ordered to leave the firm.
I'd understand what was from you.
Tom tends to become a teacher.
Have a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people in the house?
Tom should go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
Too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was a bosonog.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom's upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, I can't even remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what just started.
We're a team!

Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the other night.
That's so terrible.
I'll bring her home.

I can't stand that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use for that.
It hasn't gone down yet.
Give me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was he honest?
The cup was empty.
Don't talk.

They're close.

Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.

If I shower with hot water, the mirror is clouded in the bathroom.
Tom took pictures.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately I don't have enough money on me right now.

I made it all up.
I'd like to know why they erased my name from the list.

There's no time to explain.
Are they going to arrest me?
Unfortunately, it breaks all the rules.
What are you doing here?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound dropped a rot.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't contain himself.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.

You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?

Look around.
Pass me the French key.

Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun is constantly varied.
It was Tom who told me.
Tom looked Mary deep in the eye and smiled.
It was very suffrage in that room, because all the windows were closed.

Everything's fine.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
To find them.
I couldn't get any sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be notified in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.

You're wandering.
We'll go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a grouch.
I just cut my finger off.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does he have to leave, Tom?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive character.
It's possible someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure in dust.
We were walking along the coast.
I don't want you harassing them.
It depends on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom reacted badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was checking you out.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're so cut off.
Aren't you a banker?

She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think you're up for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So didn't we get along?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems reluctant.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't hold back.
I'll never forget it.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I am.
I've lost my computer.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.

There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel is gonna be a little expensive.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom wouldn't help me.
You were wrong.
We're glad to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.

It's our job to help them.
He suffered heavy losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint?
Why would you do that to us, Tom?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll come down here.
We're paranoid.
This is not silver.
A blood vessel burst into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't the kind of man you'd be easy to get along with.
I don't like pork.
She likes to run.
I need a sea nut.
This was a deliberate crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom read the note.
The kids were drawing pictures on the chalk sidewalk.
You wonder what took you so long.

Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom seems to not often realize what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?

I'm not a local.
What's in the plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You stink of shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning a piano.
They need the money.
He swims well.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as it took me to finish this.
I watched TV when Tom came in.
You're following us.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually quite common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Did I do something to get mad at me, Tom?
Triangles don't have four corners.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom's got it all worked out with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary broke her lipstick.
I'll give you a shot.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what he told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've looked everywhere.
I'll do the talking.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom would be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon returns.
Tom wears John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a suspicious response.
Wake me up as soon as it's morning.
Mr. Gorbachev, knock this wall down!
Tom seems stunned.
Tom's in a jam.
It's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't feel well retired.
Thanks for asking.
I have a good reason not to like Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These are her shoes.
Let him call me.
Rooms are vacant.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl wearing a scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's on his way.

I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick her up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.

Tom doesn't really like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom will be here.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school with a car.
Did you see that?
I'm gonna have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Are you writing your proverbs?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
Last time I was home Friday night when I was thirteen.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think is going to change.
That's what I do for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
You've caused me nothing but trouble.
What was Tom up to now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's just mad at each other.
Tom's going to sleep.
To protect our peace!

I'm unarmed.
Do you hate them so much?

I've got a glass of beer to fill my thirst.
Tom's on time.
Today's boring television.
Oh, great!
Tom found four-listed clubs.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to say hello to them.
Have you been smoking?
All visitors must be investigated.
Where did you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was established in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds totally valid.
It's awesome!
The water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom got here safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
There, I like challenges.
He doesn't sit on a bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of the sparks flying from the fireplace.
It's just made up.
Tom kept Mary quiet all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream of you all the time.

We're on our way to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?

I bought these medicines for my father.
Kids love cakes.
Bill's pretty reserved.

This is from us.
On an emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch it.
Who's in charge here?
He confessed to having to lie.
Mary picked up all of Tom's money.
Enough of this nonsense.
By the way, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.

Tom's got a big mouth.
That looks like tea.

Tom started hooking.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work early.
We have everything.
I baked his cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the start.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "bye"?
How much instrument can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.

These must be fakes.

We agreed to start immediately.
Is it over?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?

The tribe was not too happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open up.
Put an apron on.
It's possible you're wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still at school?
It's been an honor.
I spoke to my advisors about what items to take.
I already wrote everything I needed to write.
Make sure you don't care about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's nobody in the classroom now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe it was Tom who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say what you want for a year.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in the room below this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my bedtime schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure of anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in her ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're so cheeky.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Daddyba really very slow today, or does she seem to me?
You call me Google?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just in the shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.

That's the way you're supposed to be.
I fell in love with you.
We're models.
What do you want?
Tom got a new job.
Tom's not coming back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see a thing.
He's quite an unpleasant man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
You better be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and put another one on that spot.
Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll get her for you.
He gets tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are by no means clear.
That was very sloppy by Tom.
It's flat.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got angry.
Let them cut you.
Securing is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehabilitation.
They'll pay them well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time you're difficult and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I can't live with either without you.
Let's say for now you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's hot in here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I understood.
Tom is spineless.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all do.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm running an account.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a pan.
Tom will kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a habitat.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fusherical.
You should help them.
Tom didn't even cry.
He wrote a book, and it's great.
Tom turned the handle.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I see ghosts.
I was tired and I was cold.
Nothing is more sad than stupidity and indiscreet.
They're all on their way.
Tom did not protest.
What are the websites coming from?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
It's been all day cleaning up snow.
His paralyse is getting worse and soon, it won't be able to get out of bed.
You want to race?
I need Tom.
Changes are never easy.
Is Boston far?
They pay me to help you.
I'm too young to call.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could get it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very effective.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll have fun with that later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train as he went to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that was hung on the chimney.
Gullabs symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
You traitor!
I will do anything for the sake of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Enja's music is beautiful.
Is she a cabbie?
I must be losing my hearing.
It's over now.
I'm having a nap.
It is not scientifically proven that there is a connection between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid excessive smoking.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a man's product.
We've been looking all over for them.
I love your website.
I'm gonna get you.
Push this button.
Tom can really fight.
What's actually bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom broke his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom wouldn't break Mary's heart.
All lizards lay eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We're at peace.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is very much like mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, just go outside.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees crashed.
Lions don't know colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer is tricky.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look over here.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really good time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the crash.
I can imagine you getting married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm humbled by you.
I'll quote a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed his wallet was missing.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I'm getting a lump out of my right ear.
The cardboard box is fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're in real danger.
Tom has never told me he doesn't speak French.
These guys didn't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging my calendar on a wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
What couldn't you sleep from last night?
They put a curse on us.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
Just turn to him.
You can't deny it.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote Mary a letter and thanked her for her help.
I've decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
Turtles live long.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom sleeps very well.
Are you helping him?
She looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yes, I remember.
Did you get here in a car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over for us.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're amongst friends.
You've lost something to me.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a hot night.
Thanks for seeing me.
Susan is actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer the eggs to the pomological.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for lunatics.
Why would I help him?
Tom's got his shoes lit.
We've lost faith in humanity.
Tom is shaking hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom lent me some money.
Am I bothering you?
End violence; fight for peace.
Watch how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom is still unable to talk to us.
They'd love that very much.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Get off, Dick, it's dinner time.
I'm in pursuit.
He drove fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He swings into the boss.
The next morning, he found a hand-written letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
Nobody talks about us.
I think you're overdoing the problem.
Have you paid already?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom has worn his face.
What good is it to you?
Let's look closer.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It turns me on when he's wearing that outfit.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor below this one.
They trusted her.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to a wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but not a bastard.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a species of mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the Future Be Like Science fiction?
Tom's making fun of you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to look after his child.
I signed the word "Alice" to point it out.
Third time's the charm.
We should go.
This is a windy dough popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.

It's you.
I'm against this project.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm too late.
I could tell that Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom is quite harmless.
There are reports of writing.
It hurts here.
You're upsetting Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just picking on you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep and finish tomorrow.
You jumped one button.
Diseases often occur at the least convenient times.
This dog is staring at me like he wants to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin and were not real people at all.
The man is starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is passing, but the good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What were you thinking, Tom?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies sooner or later.
I know how to stay calm.
We love beauty.
I mean it all day long.

They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, people!
This tree is a monstrous structure.
Tom was not disappointed.
Can you write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We fly over the clouds.
I love it!
Is this correct in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She has ears like sails.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is ginger beer.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not misunderstood,
Tom is harmless.
I'll be waiting for Tom.
I guess you read my report.
Tom stepped down.
Don't repeat yourself.
The corns are wormy.
Maybe we can find something.
You look really good.
I made Tom miserable.
Melt it.
Tom seemed to grumble.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become both physically and mentally stronger.
She's a funny girl.
If I could stay, I would.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.

I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your bike dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have any professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You are my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two lines.
The titles should get readers' attention.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than bow down.
I actually work here.
Tom is suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.

Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's disease is false.

Call us.

What's it like out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.

Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's working from nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
It hurts like hell in here.
I hate this carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom got interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'm gonna get my gun.
That's where you belong.

What the fuck do you need, Tom?

Help us as much as you can.

Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to peer through the keyhole, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you limping?
Come on, Tom.
I'll make sure I get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause disease.
Up and down we're ready.
Tom has a sharp hearing.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the cork off.
I helped him break the table.
I had a potato steak last night.
It's better for your health to take the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We've given them a sedative.
Your faith sucks.
I'm sorry I even said something to them.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up in two and a half.
Tom Proppy.
I slept in the shun.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could really work.
Don't you get cold in short sleeves?
Tom is the best.
He has an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Asian Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
French was first sleng.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked their cakes.
The knife's fingerprints determine her guilt.
Can I wait here for them?
We can look in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I baked you cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe you should help them.
I sent Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
The bell saved us.
He woke me up in the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems stunned.
Your party continues your youth.
You're free to go.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
It was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
This meat smells ridiculous.
Like I should know you?
Tom skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
No matter what, I guess.
She's running slow.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in misery.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just ripped Tom's room off last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I would have sold this dog if it were higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everyone's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
You got there before they did.
Here you go, bro. Half of it.
Tom had the new missus on the table that he just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's pissed off.
The landscape is over-the-date.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't go in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating the wine win.
We don't have a week.
I'll try to cover it up.
Fall came.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
The water only takes three minutes to boil.
I could get fired for this.
What's the intent?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so magnificent.
Dan was with Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I'd like to enroll in a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, they are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat one another in the spirit of general human affiliation.
Being disgusted was an accident.
This building has a lightning bolt.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do everything by himself.
Which one's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
Supewa is oversolved.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Tom went on to practice.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
That means "yes" or "no"?
Tom looked into the tunnel.
How could you ever want to be my friend?
It seems familiar.
I envy her.
I offered to suck his dick, but he replied that he was not in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
The bosilot, the sage, the rosemary, the teaman and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a discerning man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
I don't get paid much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew Tom could not be trusted.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
So I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
She may have fooled you, but she won't fool me!
Let's just get out of here.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm sick of it.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled a few coins.
The room was a buyer.
It's simple to solve this task.
They must remove the bullet that was stuck to his spine.
It's so funny.
Does Tom look upset?
If you don't mind, this weekend.
I know what it probably sounds like to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sonzobed.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect has confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
I guess you don't know how it hurts to have a crush on you.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a thick vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I guess it's out of the question to ask Tom.
My brother arrives tomorrow morning.
You shouldn't like everything.
Are the potatoes caloric?
They'll get it soon enough.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary off for the turnip.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make a face for him.
I was waiting outside.
You're impressionable.
You should grow up and grow up a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I got lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
How about your name and phone number?
Tom shot me with a rock.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom's gonna be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They were standing right in front of the store, to avoid the rain.
I've got a couple of reasons I've got in my head.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't know Mary had cancer at all.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't quite get it.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I'm supposed to break your neck.
Why would I be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all sub-watered.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found out that there is a film called "The Russians Are Coming! the Russians Are Coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thanks.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom is not yet able to write his name?
Tom put the journal in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I'm not good at it.
Tom has a collection of bugs.
She was making tea.
Thanks for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The mice are the carriers of the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's having a sniveling.
I start tomorrow.
I haven't been honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not predict the fall of the monarchy.
I'm fucking Tom.
I love roast bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving and caused an accident.
They gave us a hug.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom salutes Mary with a wave.
That's okay.
Tom looks worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use this camera?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Don't overdo it.
Tom is a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with something?
It's so beautiful.
I don't speak English, not German.
It'll take us approximately three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would you do that, Tom?
Who are you in there with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You worry too much about him.
The President has announced that the United States will launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweeter.
Tom helped me a little.
Have I come too soon?
Sounds really cool.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his shoelaces.
I can't shut it down.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You're really good at it.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America had no right to vote.
My neighbor called a firehouse.
Tom said I need to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did you give him the dog?
Tom can't hear us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom drove off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The Buddhist rang.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's a heartless fact.
Is it delicious?
Look out!
We need to give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's getting a little carried away.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom has surrendered to his destiny.
I don't need it right now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogotá, and Osaka is similar to Madeline.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't Tom stop?
I said I'd bring him in.
Survival is a species of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I cook soup in a big pot.
If I get to know Jesus, I'll examine his stomachs.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're ready to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
He wiped his wet hair with a towel.
If an adult is lying to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
It's possible I don't graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of that.
Tom pulled a screwger out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was waving his hands.
Open notebooks.
You can't let that get thick.
Tom opened the front.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom went to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you write skillfully.
This area is located in a valley.
Do you really want to stay till Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please excuse the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
I'm sorry, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary this morning.
I'm saxing my toast with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom kicked his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's thrilled.
I almost didn't come.
I was making a cake.
Watch the count.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call you anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn everything off.
Tom was choking.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hey, how you doing?
Last month I had a bladder infection.
Watch the girls.
I'll take the weight off.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I value foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What good does that do us?
I'm just with the one I want to be with.
He invited me to his marriage.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
I just didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thanks!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be embarrassed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is quick talk.
The lock is broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom's got a lot of good things.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he needed to redeem himself.
This message is for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom raised the knife.
The war lasted for two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm no match for you.
The firm fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We don't hang out.
Where's the mailbox?
Internet is a serious matter.
Mars is the red planet.
He waved the dog with a stone.
Tom kept staring.
It's already seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Like you wrote this book yourself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be presumptuous.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were satisfied.
How do we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must drain it.
Tom's not well today.
We're not looking.
Mahmud can't stand to lose.
Nobody listens to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
I'm ready for him now.
It can't be!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgottenness and oil usually go into a pair.
Tom didn't know it happened.
I'm at the library.
I broke my pants.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly.
I agreed.
Tom confessed to pouring the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near a dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is a virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited Loara's castles.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little forward.
I think about him every day.
I'm gonna help find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
It would be a pleasure to preserve it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as you like soul.
Just grab me on the crab.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into it.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very particular in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short while.
How many stomachs do I make a day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned around to leave.
Tom is kind.
How was the party last night?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come over here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan changed into a beggar.
You have very piercing eyes.
Isn't that implied?
She seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want them all shot.
I think I'm pretty good at writing.
Will you go back to work?
I'll be with you soon enough.
Dopushi so go inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems more angry.
Would you like a drink of water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the amount is not true.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
The squares have four corners.
I kept working.
You've developed an addiction.
Would you like me to go with you?
We'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and kept silent.
Get a shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary switched to her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
The mass is over.
Tom erased the knife blade from his jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I could get that to happen.
Do your gums bleed?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer mug on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I speak French.
He gave me an insufferable view.
Don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna get another one.
Will you get off?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
He looked at me sharply through his glasses.
Linda convinced Dunn that he was stalking her.
Why would they mind that?
Let's not bother Tom.
This rope is tough.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do it.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave yourself.
I need to free us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom hurt himself?
Who can break the aquarium?
I'm sick of it.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has struggled with depression at many times in his life.
Should I get your bags?
I would trust my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's there to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class went wild.
There were penguins' footprints on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a clapper.
I want to brush my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much of your soul as you like.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the test results?
If you want quality, pay up.
Tom was looking at something.
She's studying analystically.
With such a rich dream, he will become either a famous writer or a lunatic.
We both hate her.
She's getting beat up.
Tom opened the bedroom windows.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spits the gum.
May it be my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended that?
How did you pull that off?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to develop bad habits!
She's started acting weird.
Probably won't pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dunn asked Linda how she was born an interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're just as strong with you.
The President looked strong.
What do I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked out.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'm gonna be in Boston this whole week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were better at playing chess than me.
Is the bridge secure?
Give an example.
Kennedy talked about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a tight town.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What's that, Tom?
He's very handsome.
Let the buyer watch out.
Tom runs away from class a lot.
Now is the time for compensation.
Most virgins have read hymen.
You can make it through.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor call me a saint, when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a Communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was held up, we waited in the rain for a long time.
You'll figure it out.
Does she have a dog?
He's resting on me.
Mary wore false eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French better than he really spoke.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Mary didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
I've had my shoes soaked.
That doctorship calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look foolish.
His mother is an American.
Relax a little bit.
Is Tom fun?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help finding her.
It means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fushersky did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed pissed off.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blind.
I've been looking for him for a while.
He's doing a good job.
Tom got sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait here?
Enjoy your day.
Tom just got dumped.
I prefer cow cheese.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy products in a while.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everyone having fun?
I've been waiting all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was fierce.
Pillars cut wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Ziny to the end.
The singles shouldn't be able to get married.
The cow forgot it was once a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Smokin' is a hand job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I need to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister break the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put out the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why should I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting over there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
There is still no trace of nor a voice from Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The Alligator ate the hound.
Lies give birth to other lies.
I'm out of money.
The chair is plastic.
The sun's light is reportedly the best means of delinfaction.
You're gonna get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
Get serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary did.
That was very useful.
You stood me up.
Did you call an ambulance already?
Donness after lunch, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
It turned on a red light.
John's at the airport.
Tom should have been ready an hour ago.
Let a conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Today the first snow fell.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?

Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't really mean that kind of thing.
There's wind.
I'm just kidding with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.

Tom's not much of a talker.
You guys were right.
It happens.
There were no others injured.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you can handle it.
Are you going to eat at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'm sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I'm drinking milk.
Don't make Tom mad.
It's a painful task.
You need to get him to listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
If only he were here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom calls Mary a lot.
Thank you, darling.

When did I try to give you money?
How's your mom?

She didn't show.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him on your behalf.
Don't tell my mom.
You can avoid such problems if you have this advice in mind.

What's in it for me?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good dog name?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You shouldn't be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're so passionate.
I've had my headache.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars, and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a tissue.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't feel bad about it.
Isn't that unusual?
I got off a wall.

Tom has to be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?

I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning to stay with us?
Give him everything we've got.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you doing?
This is your house now.
Why don't you try some sushi?
How do you manage?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
If only I could live my life doing only what I love.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, no charges have been made.

When's my turn?
Tom failed.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a print error.
Not often does one buy a thousand dollar hat.
Will the police come?
We have to find him first.
Dan made the assistants laugh with his comments.
You shouldn't go.

I can't get involved.

They shut up.
Tom soon came back.
I'd be in.
History is written by winners.

Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're calling her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I acted like that.
I was on three corners.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner today.
I don't eat in restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
It looks like you have an infection.
I can't think of anything better.
The sky is red in twilight.
I came to wish you luck.
It would be a pleasure to have you too.

Would you like a cookie?
Who brought this?

Dan might have had a fight with Linda.
It was quiet in the room.
Everyone loves him.

Go to Tom's house.
Is your dog barking?
Beautiful!
The palace has a high tower.
Kids have homework to do.

It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was threatened.
I wish I hadn't.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
The hole is tight.
You should go help him.
Are you enjoying it?
I had a great night.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll kick you out.
Step aside.
Let's get started!
How long does it take?
I'm fine, thank you!
Don't be late for your meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.

Tom, I only put on one shoe.
You don't want to do something that reminds them that you're actually not big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.

I can give you a ride.
Is Tom safe?
However, there is a solution.
You're unorganized.
I insist.
I'm sure Tom can handle it like this.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you complete the task?
We have to go back for him.
You're rude.
Do you do any sports?
It just sounds boring.
Get him inside.

I swear.
We have three guards working alternately.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Could you present in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Is Tom contributing?
This is a little embarrassing.
We've both been busy.
I'm three hours away.
I want crossroads.
I was expecting them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
Well, don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not crazy.
He never hired them.
I love cakes.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.

I've been shaking my head.
Tom told me he was planning on going to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a whole other story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going to end it.
I'm gonna go change.
He hung up on me.
It may have sounded like a proposition, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom went on to work.
Please find me a header.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom disagrees.
They've rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, my movie's gonna pop.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, never really, could have happened here.

Here's your schedule today.
Tom didn't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom is an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The game is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is, what are you going to do?
Tom told Mary she loved her.
Well, we're not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find it.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It was raining two days ago.
The job is not shameful.
If you bite me, I'll eat you too.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I baked apple pie.
The horse's hoof cannon put him at ease.

These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom hooked up with Mary.
Are you cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask Tom for permission.
His joke made us all laugh.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need to.
This is pointless.
They did.
How many cups of coffee a day is too much?
Tom hates to run.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I've rolled with my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
And you would have done the same in my place.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I'm smiling.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Will you go?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling each other.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I take a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom earns three times as much as I do.
I got one.
Write your birth date.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.

We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary wouldn't be able to come to our party.
Just try and find him.

I think Tom's tiny.
Is the difference visible?
Come visit us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom hasn't actually done it.
Is this your purse?
Sleep will help her the most.
This is Nina, your niece.
I'll do the dishes.
They've been chanting for half an hour.
He's been doing a lot of intense things lately, but he doesn't see the slightest result of it.
Dan found out that Linda was looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to my house next Saturday, if you like.
I'm not convinced.
That's not necessarily necessary anymore.
Would you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was wandering.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where is your sister?
Tom sleeps hard.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You got a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thanks for stopping by.
I'm just as tall as he is.
Tom wouldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
Dan spent the last night drinking in a meat bar.
I'm in.
Do you need a rend?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really sweet.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is no other joke.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen a rainbow.
I don't think we've been followed.
I feel like I'm free.
Just smile and keep smiling.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom doesn't have tea.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
But that's no argument at all!
Tom got a pie.
What do I tell the kids now?
Leave him alone, Tom.
I've been through the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom this tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How was your vacation?
Then we were just a few people in the middle of a group of gorillas.
She started pushing her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
If I don't invite Tom to my party?

Are you traveling much?
Have you told Tom about the back pain you've got?
That's what they all do.

Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.

You'd be happier if you three came back out.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
Kids blow bubbles.
Tom practices violin for at least half an hour every day.
I still get angry with Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so much fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered along with them.
If only Tom had more time for me.
I long for him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a big shock.
Your car's on fire.
She was able to learn to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have strength of will when it comes to exercise.
Let's go to Tom's.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room is a rubum.
To your service.
I like watching football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need this much food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed to be a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my home.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for the money.
The more things I have, the more I have to clean up.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to rub cream against the sun.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice was barely heard.
Don't sound.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that be?
We'll have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom is good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is only love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom will be waiting.
I need you to lean down.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon was dropping slowly.
Who likes insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps, then jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You've never thought about it before, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew right away something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures to me have no meaning.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; either way you have to.
It worked.
Are you ten?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny eat pizza.
It's no big deal.
We need something that will get our mind off our problems.
I called her yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells sea schools.
Guard the prisoner.
We all like you.
The boy cried and cried for hours.
I'm gonna go ask them.
Tom is nothing like his brother.
Tom was spiteful.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom couldn't possibly do it alone.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
Maybe you'll be needed.
I have chest pain.
I can't untie this knot.
Give me my money back.
You have to show yourself first.
My father is a quiet man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
You stole my new wristwatch.
It doesn't look very different.
He's re-edited.
Tom made room for Mary on the bench.
We're calling him.
It's good.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if to be happy or not.
Did you arrest her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his trip.
Your proposition is up and down accurate.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary walked out of the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the jewels last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom is your teacher.
I already packed.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do it myself.
You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other one.
I'm sure that's what Tom did.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost there.
Married to me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and the night is shining.
No one's getting fired.
There's no one else.
On my way to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
You pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom got off the hook.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The one who pays the bills has the right to be masters.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, get me some mush.
When will you visit us?
Tragedies occur every day.
We didn't get you anything.
I'm good at hearing.
Give me those papers.
You can have mine.
Tom's not gonna like that.
All the comments are inexorable.
Did you do this for me?
Can you get them some help?
Tom burst his mouth.
That smells like cheese.
Tom's not wrong.
Patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
The virtue without gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want any milk.
Tom seems offended.
We know him.
I stayed there for hours.
Tom had a drink in his hand.
What a pair they are!
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your complaints have upset me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom loves his job?
It's noisy in here.
What can be taken?
I guess you found it.
Don't take it too badly.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm going and I'm going.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom cooperates.
The snow is a deep one rate.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom's been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby swallows the bell.
I'm gonna go look for Tom now.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This will do for now.
They should talk.
It didn't happen that way.
It's not like you were wrong.
Tom listened immediately.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
There is no life without you.
You've got me all wrong.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Don't call me a jerk.
You're very attracted to me.
What's for dinner?
Open up on page nine.

Iranians are a peaceful people.
What can we do for her?
I really like this wine.
He doesn't like fish meat.
We had a fight.
Does Tom eat grapes?
Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't curse or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a gift.
I'm not quite happy with Tom's explanation.
I guess you're right.
He got away so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom has not yet returned.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to dance with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
We need to set a trap.
Tom's parked, he'll be right there.
Love me a little, love me long.
Tom is in the living room watching cartoons with the kids.
There's no answer for everything.
Tom was afraid to tell his own about what had happened.
It was in mud to the knees.
You told Tom about it, right?
Tom's calling Mary.
Tom's not generous.
There's nothing you can prove.
Tom hates green peppers.
Don't you panic?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom's resourceful.
He's an honest man.
Those pyjamas are too big.
We'll turn around.
Is there anyone else?
Not all people are equal, it is, however, good news, because it means not all people are bad.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.
The objective of punctuation signs is to help the reader.
I'll be happy to do that.
Will you come to Boston with us next year?
Why do you hesitate?
We already know the truth.
That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to figure out where you put your passport.
That's really great.
Tom wondered if Mary had already woken up.
Do you want to get you home?
That house is made of bricks.
We didn't draw any conclusions.
Tom came in about 2:30.
Doesn't sound like who knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I've got a cat storm.
The crowd clapped.
I let childlies grow on the edges.
I think Tom's mean.
The door was locked.
I'm gonna get your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what do you see?
We've been subverted.
I was too tired to go on.
Everything has its own sound.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
He's writing to his forehead.
I got a call last night from a man named Tom Jackson.
Can this page be used similar to Twitter?
It shouldn't be too hard to complete the report by 2:30.

She's got nogopics.
Are these your bags?
For what reason do you learn English?

I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch up with you to explain everything.
Dan returned to London.
My dad bought me a digital wristwatch for my birthday.
You know me too well.
Tom's human-free.
Don't you feel lonely?
Did you make coffee?
Don't get so excited about it.
Stand up when you talk to me.
He's always cheerful.
The forest was very calm.
I have to go back for them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's intrusive.
Most of the clothes worn by Europeans are produced outside of Europe.
Tom is still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can look online.
When I was younger, I always traveled on a highway.
I couldn't determine exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will object.
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
I got myself a pair of shoes.
You're so negative.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the internet.
My wallet's in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait here for them?
When I pee, something like a puss emerges.
You beat her.
The stars have appeared.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I often play volleyball.
Where's the shirt I bought you?
That'll teach them a turn.
I have to sit down, my soul is in the nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like that.
Tom Douchy.
We're ready to fight.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.
I don't understand why everyone thinks this book is so good.
Tom was hired.
It's been a while, especially fast.
There's no way out.

My wife is hiding something from me.
What can we offer our guests?
Tom lost his temper.
Watch the count.
There must be a key.
He cut the apple in half.
All the balls are yellow.
I have a white cat.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
Get on the couch.
Did they get anybody?
The factory produces toys.
Tom didn't mean that.
Let them help us.
I'm very busy here.
What were you singing?
I can figure it out.
The room has an ocean view.
I don't need a ride.
Don't eat like cattle.
There was water all over the kitchen floor.
Cancer is a great enemy of humanity.
It's still for sale.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
From time to time, I would have been taken by a carriage.
Tom put the gun down.
There's no theoretical chance of doing the job in one day.
You almost freaked out.
Suddenly I felt old.
They're annoying me.
She was sleeping.
I'm ready.
You killed him to avenge your late father.
Tom took a cookie.
I've studied French since I was thirteen.
Men are actually not so different from women.
Eugenia shared with us her favorite face purification oils and skin care.
I'm sick of French.
I don't care if there's twenty chicks.
The bull fly.
Tom's walking.
Are you open tonight?
They don't understand.
Born in 1960.
Can I have one?
Baburs are usually mild to taste.
I'm fired.
It could rain today.
We were ready.
Let's go to Boston.
Here's my membership card.
Somebody told me that.
You're beautiful.
Wash yourself.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have a minute?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I'm not gonna bother you.
Stay here and keep her safe.
Wouldn't you start pulling hair out of that?
How will you escape?
Let's start with this wine.
My leg is broken.
How are you going to make that happen?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd like to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who ever met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That's exactly what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these minions from my grandmother.
I don't have a drinking problem.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong one.
She's in great condition.
I grabbed Tom for an elbow.
Mary likes fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom listened.
I think I was wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be true.
You look imaginary.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
She's getting out.
The noise will wake the baby.
I'm late, spinach.
Do you know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom sat on the sofa with Mary and watched TV.
Nothing bothers us.
I think I should have asked for help.
Tom wears a stethoscope.
Glad to see you, Tom.
How are yours?
I'm not usually at work on Monday.
I'm a fool to believe them.
Tom might need a little help.
They went to worship every day.
Tom was a teacher.
He'd be broken.
There's a crowd at the bar.
You've lost the idea.
Tom wondered more and more.
Who gave them that kind of money?
We've got to get them a present.
When did the war end?
Did the dish machine work?
Tom is a married man.
Like Tom said, this soup is oversolved.
Did I miss a lot?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come outside?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a fen?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Can I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this all about?
You'll have to study harder next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There's algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
Nobody likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Wow!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die than grant your request.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?
Tom caught two seats.
I'll send you the prescription.
It would look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like most.
Your transgressions dishonored the graves of your ancestors.
Don't get discouraged now.
It looks like her style.
I've had enough wrestling.
He's not like us.
What do you think Tom did?
I'm a journalist.
Sarah has 31 pens.
This is very confusing.
I bring scary news.
If possible, I'd like to experience such bitter sweet love again as in primary.
I saw Tom in the area.
They're surprised.
I'm from Rome.
Tom's film broke.
It's a stupid rule.
Is this what Tom suggested?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with his homework?
Tom doesn't know what it's like to be poor.
Tom thinks Mary should be happy.
We're all eager to watch the movie.
I'll be in Skopje tomorrow.
We're done talking.
I'm training.
Cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He cannot focus on his academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They became addicted.
I just want money.
I'm not saying a lot of shit about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
I've recovered completely.
I was the only one who knew where Tom went.
How badly was Tom hurt?
Was he sympathetic?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time anything unusual happens, they blame me.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that mean?
I'm sick of being called a liar.
The beggars can't overhear.
Is there any sugar?
Dan and Linda eventually moved to London.
She suddenly passed out.
You looked funny.
Tom plays in a band.
We live together now.
You've been busy.
I'm sorry, isn't it a mistake?
I didn't say anything.
The ship has changed direction.
Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I have no intention of explaining anything.
Aprils-li-li-li!
Tom used to say that.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I've decided to stay where I am.
I think you'll have work to do.
Open up, sesame!
Tom looked out.
Tom enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-handed.
Take a picture with or without a flash?
He and his sisters ate ice cream while the radio was released.
Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom's in Australia.
I think I can solve this problem by myself.
They're too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom's an adult now.
We don't sell alcoholic beverages and cigarettes to minors.
I took the bus back.
Here's how we do it.
Tom doesn't act like a typical college teacher.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe it was a cat.
The struggle is seemingly not the end of it.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom's devastated.
I forgot to tell Tom who was picking him up at the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom's not kidding.
Did you get anything?
Let's do it now and we're done.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mom put the collage in the top drawer.
You've been in a car accident, but you're gonna be fine.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?
Don't ruin our fun.
I can make that happen.
I don't discriminate.
I'll go if Tom goes.
We'll be back in a month.
It is recommended to check if there can be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while drinking the medication they prescribed for you.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry I barged in.
I like to swim.
It was from her.
We can talk to Tom.
I assumed it was free.
You're gonna need help.
Do I need a lawyer?
We need to get to work.
I went on a trip to Boston.
Tom started climbing.
Tom likes you very much.
Tom rang Mary.
This is the first time I put pepper on eggs.
I'll manage.
The cure worked.
Tom can play guitar.
Who broke it?
The liner's short.
I'm sick of Tom.
I like you so much.
I want to take you somewhere I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, that's not what I meant!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I can't remember buying this.
He saved a sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up, you lazy fuck!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd be avoiding Tom for a while.
I'm not waiting to find out.
Let's continue this conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.
I feel like I let you down.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?
I'm stuck.
You're with Tom, right?
This orange is really delicious.
I kind of like it.
I love golf.
Nobody likes us very much.
It's very rare.
I'm not good at this.
Tom took a candy.
You won't find them.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Tom was very busy.
All set.
She's moody.
It's all in the file.
Let's not ruin it.
Just get it over with.
Have you decided yet?
Tom's listening.
Can anyone hear me?
How do you keep up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come by tomorrow.
When did you get up?
I have a crush on you.
Tom is in his bedroom talking on the phone.
It's been hard for us.
Sharpen your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on a leash.
I'd much rather go alone.
It was from them.
I want to lie down and get some rest.
Tom is in the hospital and recovering from what he overdosed on.
He snapped the nut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were cooking to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him, she hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They look busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's the guy.
When you go on a date with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this is neither the right time nor the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom's untrustworthy.
Mary gets annoyed when Tom leaves the toilet lid up.
That's good practice.
This chair is self-specified.
I should have refused.
I had to consider what might happen.
That was my tactic.
I've lived here for many years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my lobe.
I know you've done your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside cover of his notebook.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know them both.
I need to feel sorry for them.
I don't bargain.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I don't comment on them.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
That's a hell of a gun.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.
It's just words.
There was a brief silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met last year in Boston.
Tom curses excessively.
No one's walking in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't mind.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was adorable.
I agree with this plan.
Justice is expressed through works.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America you're expected to tip the waiter.
Such behavior was childish on his part.
I'm walking with her.
That would be fine.
Sorry about yesterday.
Go away while you still can.
Tom was a little embarrassed about Mary.
I don't need those.
Did Tom give you that?
Cars replaced carriages.
I've been kidnapped.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
This tea is so delicious.
We're on the same level.
Tom was surprised and a little confused.
Tom is very strict with himself.
She's a nerd.
Lemonada is cold.
The lamp swayed back and forth.
Tom seems uncertain.
There's nothing else to look for.
Tom is a materialist.
He can't do that.
Why should I worry about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my umbrella.
Tom has no manners.
Pray for her.
Can you hold on for a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at her pole in the square.
Didn't anyone let you know you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell out of the tree.
Tom told Maria he'd never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Let me know if you get a boyfriend.
It was remarkable.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was half asleep.
Do not expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the mild things and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna wander.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
It stinged me.
Don't you ever assume anything?
I was staring at the man.
Watch him, Tom.
They look familiar.
We have work for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river runs through the valley.
Put her through.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I want you with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom became deeply interested in art history.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you get any sleep?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town and he needs a job.
I was surprised tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
He had a great concert.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a painting.
This is really easy.
Are you going to walk?
You should try it on.
You've been worried enough.
I don't think Tom's gonna help us much.
Tom looks worried.
I'm worried about him.
Tom is outstanding.
I think Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting close.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom is sympathetic.
Make it short, Tom.
Tom called to ask if he had any help.
We could've handled it.
This is no one's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go have lunch.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It's got to be made from somewhere.
The weekendtime was fully equipped, with a pool, barbecue, a football field and a pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking questions about me.
While eating pizza, he bore his sister.
We should have quit early.
That's close enough.
Tom is polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been futile.
"Why are you doing that?" "I can do it."
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom's heating up.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds completely acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and reliable and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I won't give in.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not going to freak out.
She shut down the computer.
She bought it in a butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why should I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two genders in Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed talking on the phone.
These are amazing.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was in the middle of something.
I'm eating a pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need to pass them on now.
The noise knocked out all the city.
One who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They flashed.
You're mean.
Did you hand the note to Tom?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You've got little chest.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was busy.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She's always wearing attacked clothes.
Tom was a boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Chicks don't like you.
Time to get up.
This isn't your problem, it's mine.
Before I went to bed, I drank three cold pills.
It's possible that Tom is wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom acts like a spoiled derries.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is eternal.
For one thing, you have no right to make conclusions, and secondly, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience is seemingly bored.
I grow goods.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom's got mustaches.
There was a war going on.
Was Tom involved?
The thief's changed to a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom is angry and scared.
You're mean and you're repellent.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom no longer sees.
I think we're done here.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the facade of the building, when I passed her by with a car, I didn't recognize her.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's just.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting in circles on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Invite him to join us.
It will not be easy to do so without much help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
She was given a sedative.
This isn't about the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed to be deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, the same will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'm gonna get divorced.
That dinner.
My jar's leaking.
They'll make you wrinkles.
Tom is a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes burst.
The geyser releases hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting that we give all the money to Tom, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home I could go back to.
I'm here on my own.
It's to protect you.
I've always had someone help me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you connect with him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
Above all, be kind to older ones.
The gemstones include the aquamarine, the amethist, the serragd, the quartz, and the rubin.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother for permission before.
I'll take Tom's place.
What did you think of coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom offended Mary.
I know I packed it.
Enough with the chickens.
It was a beautiful day.
I got him to take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I had a quick lunch.
Tom remembered various things that no one else remembered.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I have learned, French has been the easiest.
Tom did his homework.
I counted to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
Her boyfriend looks like a monkey.
Pepperuges are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We have a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you get the money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Say the idea specifically.
Can I get a tattoo?
They've all been so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'll lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's terrible.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Are they getting there with a car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do what suits me.
Tom's got a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I found something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
It's a beautiful link.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom yelled at Mary.
Were you home alone?
He surprised a large sum of money from her.
Can you help me sort this out?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only desire was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'm gonna go find another one.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make webs.
You really talk a lot.
It might be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom shouldn't always believe what they say.
He's in love with his head to his heels.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate purpose.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's a pain-install.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're smart!
It seems to me that it is the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I'm gonna do when I'm retired.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom can do anything.
Soon the sound is gone.
Who threw you?
I don't quite get it myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how palm trees are planted.
How do you know about him?
Just keep walking.
Tom's a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired that he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom gonna get in?
There's someone on the porch.
Tom didn't leave.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try and call her.
It's been a great day.
It's been a wonderful evening.
I think I might sneeze.
Go ahead.
Peter may need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom's not talking to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'm gonna scream.
I'm not your errand boy.
What's our status?
Do you want me to keep it?
You're a real human-free man.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's in charge?
I'm serious.
I think it's better if we don't drink the water.
Nobody's talking.
What's it to you to contact them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why that's so hard to believe.
I don't want to be treated differently than before.
They should be fine.
I followed the rules.
Tom is a widower.
I think Tom's callous.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You already have.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed while painting themselves with their phones.
He thinks that old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who's laughing, but not who's crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing a red scarf around his neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
He was stinking.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He splits up listening to music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom did not accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say his party was gonna start?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would be happy with Mary.
Dan was doing his job very well.
My legs still hurt.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I passed out.
It's hard to assess his ability.
That's good.
I know the man sitting right there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I'm open to everything.
I used to look after you.
Stand where they are.
Are you a subterranean?
"She loves music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber was cut.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna get lost.
Her sister gave her a flu shot.
Did you try talking to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a ladder while cleaning his gutters.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Quiet, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the compositions were good except for yours.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
The next year, my birthday falls off on Sunday.
Everyone laughed.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom does push-ups.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to this cave?
Dan didn't want to go to an orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I still think about him.
I thought I was seeing things.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one's come.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how it's used if you don't show him.
You bought something for Mary.
Nothing resembles a lunatic more than a drunk.
Take Tom.
Tom started taking his clothes off.
I know Tom's suffering.
It looks good.
We stopped in Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate on all this fuss.
Deal cards, Tom.
The bandits tied his mouth.
Smile at him.
This drug will ease the pain.
I'd like to buy you dinner.
Can't you just wait for that?
They'll pay for their overpower.
Dan didn't miss any episode of that soap opera.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom went well.
I hate her just as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard him.
We're investigating the entire area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me I'd like to come visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everybody.
We'll be right here.
Why do they do that?
I went to college for four years and got nothing but a miserable bachelor's degree.
This is priceless.
Do you like to draw?
It was pretty gross.
Tom is listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, there was nothing left but ash.
Tom likes all kinds of vegetables but cabbage.
Try putting yourself in his shoes.
Tom used to write lyrics.
We'll take Tom home.
Tom should know about this.

Humans cannot create miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to turn it off from their company.
Those who mix the verb endings "-ts" and "tsya" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened darker than that?
Do you know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're all over the place.
I didn't count on it.
I wasn't.
It's been the past week that I've seen Tom.
This shouldn't take long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom's got to clean up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everyone knows how to drive.
Tom planted two tubes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences for the whole month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You've made some money.
It's really nasty.
Would you like some cheese?
They say the eggplants contain a lot of nicotine.
I guess I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is all wise and pious.
I'll pass it on to Tom.
I don't think I can pass the test.
I think we're going to join.
Tom leaned forward.
Tom's keeping his car pretty good.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All the people on earth came from a common ancestor.

I'm neat.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent's open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom doesn't go to the market.
I came to bring him a gift.
I asked her to describe him.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What is she?
Can people really be so brilliant as to think that the whole population of Georgia, which speaks Caucasian language that there are no common phoneys or common letters with English, can completely master English in just two years?

Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom is the right one for me?
Tom is studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that a wonderful sound?

It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate's very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is difficult.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Take care of this mess.
Blood flows in the blood vessels.
You borrow books.
I can barely move.
Tom wondered what a good singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I sing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I'd love to learn French very much.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan got a lesson the hard way.
You showed my friends the fake.
I give my workers the right to leave early.
Are you here alone?

They're doing it now.
Thanks to the win, he became a hero.

Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.

The virtues are in themselves a reward.
It all makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying facility.
I asked you how you were doing.
I don't know how to act here.
We should advertise on television.

Yesterday I prepared a mushroom roast.
I hope it works.

Cover him up.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the pit?
The bread is fresh out of oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'm gonna get Tom to examine him.
That was a disgrace.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.

That was so bad.
This must be yours.
That's when we got here.
I kind of felt sorry for you.
The cigars are adult sculls.
Tom and Mary left hand prints in liquid cement.
Cavaller would never do anything like that.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was inevitable.
This is beautiful.
Tom, don't do this to me on Toshaw.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I got him something.
I would say no.
Nobody deserves to die.
I didn't know what that meant at the time.
Tom never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would you do that?
I'd like to lease a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold coins.
Fortunately this shed is stable, otherwise the storm last night would have knocked her down.
I heard she got caught.
Tom's got it all written down somewhere.
There is no good news.
And who do you work for these days?
I'll quit.
Maria’s eyes dawned on her.
It's evil to curse.
I only have one minute.
Tom never quits.
I think Tom's conservative.
How good are you guys?
I'd love a piece of pie.
I'm tired of your repeated complaints.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballet dancer.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's being mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too fast.
You scared her.
Tom tricked us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom won't come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The seller tricked him.
It's all in the room.
It's Tom's office.

I don't need a cardiogram.
Do you want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I don't wait to see Dadba's new version.
Everything looks pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did he really do that, Tom?
I didn't know how to play basketball at all.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to be asked to give a talk.

I can't see anything.
Ride your horses.

Tom felt so lonely.
I'm very fond of trying out new things.
Tom was not the only survivor after the massacre.
Let's talk about you.

He did miracles.
Irons secrete chemical substances into the body.
It wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It would be best if you didn't talk that much.
This is a new model.
I was helping her.
The music unites.
This is just a simulation.
It's good to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He's overly generous.
Tom slept outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bike.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Get over here!
You could've refused.
Why wouldn't I let me help?
It'll happen soon enough.
Get me out of here before I choke.
It'll happen what happens.
I heard that story.
It's still dark out there.
That's what Tom was trying to say.
Is Tom alone in there?
I'll find her.

I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak up?
Where will the meeting be?
Let's play "The Truth or Challenge".
His conclusions have been narrowed to unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom started going through the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom loves flowers very much.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I passed out.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
Do you know who I am?
Why aren't you listening?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren's song to me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.

The ambes are single-celled organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long were you in Boston?

How late was the train?
Let's park over there.
That's so stupid.
Yesterday it was hot, but today it's more sustained.
I'm cold.
He was walking in front of me.
Give that back to me.
Are you breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This is not right for me.
It's possible someone was following them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a bank.
I wish I'd met her.
You smiled.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather strap.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This won't work.
He's soon gone.
The kids were so excited about the party that they couldn't sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel very guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard on him.
You defeated me.

It's ringing me.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The study covered mathematics, physics, and chemistry.

Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Well, didn't you say you could swim?

Attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of how you gave a speech.
This sentence has five words.
She ate lamb steaks, potatoes and mushroom soup for dinner.
We were waiting outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.

I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not really an option.

Maybe we should stop.

There's no way it was Tom.
I'll kill you.
Most people have great resistance to getting up early, even when they are necessary.
Give me the gloves.

Who's there with you?
What are you getting so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should be understood in oils and motor lubricants.
How was yesterday?

I'm married to Lori.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm salting my omelet.
Tom explained to Mary the rules in detail.
Did you get him a dog?
You're sick, right?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remained unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled my knife out.

I should go change.

Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
I'm Klaustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom soon got lost in the crowd.
For the record, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a baby.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
I'm not surprised.
That surprised me.
This is the job we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly gender transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn to the corner.
She ratted me out.
Why do you close your eyes when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I've got it all wrong.
It's almost over.
I didn't say yes.
Did you know my father?
Tom was cooking to shoot me.

Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
Anything or nothing.
This information is classified.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
Nobody talks about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
You and I will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom can't hear us.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does an hour begin?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years back.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm rang.
The bird raised the twig with its beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to make time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom struggled to free himself.
What do they need me for?
Tom didn't tell Mary anything.
It's not the right time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It lasted a lot more than I thought it would last.
Tom ran past Mary.
I got scratched by a cat.
Tom's not old-fashioned.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Did he have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best great-looking one.
I can't ask them now.
Tom's got the waves of hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's so cool.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's a simple question.
The bush is on fire.
Tom was affected.
I'm just a little bit bit of a conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Each state has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Toads are amazing creatures.
He's got three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom got drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You've had enough trouble.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something to him.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you trust us?
I respect you.
Be merciful.
Follow the others.
Before I sleep, I hear music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was it a good trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You should create a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom picked up the ridges.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the king's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where did you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed his job.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to start your car.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
You lied to me in the eye.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to get drunk.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware that Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll walk away.
They'd just mind Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I've learned the cause.
I don't have anything to give you.
They found an isolated beach so they'd spend the day there.
Nothing has changed.
They were all on alert.
It's a little fake, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It concerns you.
That's a very dry explanation.
The walk before breakfast is refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in place of their choice.
Wasn't it terrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his harsh attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
He was framed for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the film.
It's pretty simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom's got his shirt on from behind.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
The dinner was so good!
Control yourself.
The scale is communicative, and the sharing is not.
I'm teasing.
Tom took off his hat and gave it away.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's going to go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what's in today's paper?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks from three to six coffees a day.
Tom carved out loud.
It was Bether.
Tom started growling.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We're saving two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed to her.
Maybe Tom dies by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be on time.
Tom was freaking out.
This tin is empty.
There's grapes in the cooler.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom the first time?
Tom relaxes his arm.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The parrea clouded my glasses.
So, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
It's a fact.
We were all rooting for her.
Haven't you seen the al- flag?
Chill out!
I told you it would be hard to pull off.
I think I found one of those.
You'll try, won't you?
Tom's been out of food for a week.
I don't really understand you.
Even though I'm a noble man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so angry.
A lot of people are hunting.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does the same thing Mary does.
We have to examine something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How's your chest?
Tom drank in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary put him down.
We met in a meana.
How was Tom acting?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
There was nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
Lekov must be drunk on an empty stomach.
Tom's not in.
I guess it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is space black?
I dropped myself.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
Pigs of marzipan don't gartaate.
Tom regained consciousness.
Tom made Mary angry.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good for it.
Tom might be coming today.
Tom distinguishes us between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom has no strength of will.
Will you help?
Don't you pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I stopped by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, already.
Better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
They dig a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We got out of there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of family are you?
You deserve a higher pay.
He found someone to talk, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
I'm bored.
How's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they have invented a cure for it yet.
Every member must attend.
She didn't get her joke.
This is the worst snowman I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom dead?
Do you understand his name?
Doesn't seem to be helping.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
Marriage is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on the subject.
You're just.
I'll go.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy any presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're beautiful.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What's luck?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You brushed your collarbone while playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The play's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom is blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was nasal.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something amazing happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please inform them.
I have to call her.
He asked me if there was something cooking for me.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom as a hill.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't be wasting my nerve over it.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look furious?
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's closing time.
Leave it to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to a hairdresser.
Tom's insane.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't cost him the heart.
It should not be commented.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin's so cute.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was okay here.
They look stunned.
I could make your job easier.
Put the phone down.
I'd never get out of my house in slippers.
I think Tom's a plapidlak.
A tooth from a terrible infection and the ovator and it swelled.
I don't need counseling.
This isn't right.
It's out of the question.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's acting weird sometimes.
We would hang them.
Now is probably not the time for this.
I'll be back in a moment.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we just take it all?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a blackberry cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is so relaxing.
Call him now.
Stick to the subject.
She really wants to gossip.
I have questions of tons.
This is an interesting, ridiculous, and even stressful story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pyjamas on.
This way.
This is holy ground.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just don't talk anymore.
It's my birthday in July.
We have everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where did you find her, for God's sake?
This was the top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a pagan.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we got home.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found another one.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's pretty hot for a demequare?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Do you have a crush on him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked her a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people fit in this room?
I already thought of that.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've twisted your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little wet.
Tom decided to become vegan.
I don't have time today.
Nobody wants to buy these things.
Neither here nor there.
Phonebooks are fascinating.
There's no need for you to be defensive.
This is the most beautiful pizza in the whole city.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
