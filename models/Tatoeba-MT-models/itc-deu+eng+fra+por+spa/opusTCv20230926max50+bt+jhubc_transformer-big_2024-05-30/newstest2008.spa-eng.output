European inflation slipped into food
Accelerated inflation in the euro area is primarily due to the dizzying rise in food prices.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, registering - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent, announced the Statistical Office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only likely at 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and reduced forced unemployment, would provoke a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "we have to negotiate" on inflation so that later it does not have to intervene in this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, broke the twelve-year record; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation surged in the euro area as a result of galloping food and energy prices.
Wheat forwards rose 88 percent and soybean prices reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching nearly $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while by 2009 it will already fall to 1.9 percent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stalemate, by early December support for the Alliance of Young Democrats had risen significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while Gallup had never before experienced such a low level – 13 percent – in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of secure party voters - due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) versus a support of one-fifth for the socialists (20 percent).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach even the limit necessary to have some parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the secure voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous low - it has never been higher, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as next year is concerned, the majority of the population is experiencing a deterioration of the situation and only a tenth expect an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, higher than any previous Gallup poll, said the prime minister is doing poorly than good.
Thirteen percent of respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány very much, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of respondents.
54 percent of the population does not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent does not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced in front of the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 percent thought it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, today this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believes that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the participation question responded that it would surely participate and another 20 percent said it is likely to participate.
By comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" would surely participate only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believe likely to participate. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
Seventy-four percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of tuition fees, 79 percent of the medical consultation service, and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of study fees, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The average price level increase of 16 percent was maintained by the hypermarkets of the Budaörs gold trading triangle, with the difference that this year VAT has not been increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the gold trading triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the newspaper Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth well above the thousand HUF.
As in December last year prices had already been "fired" in grocery stores, so there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is evidently frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below nine thousand HUF, today they cannot do it even for ten thousand.
The basket of Napi in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003, that basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in Auchan we have also found a kilogram of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with two-liter redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to Christmas prices last year, Cora rose by 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices listed in the Napi basket.
Comparing last year’s most expensive basket with this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was HUF 1206, so that during Christmas last year in prices we felt the increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of a product’s circulation, he may lose a significant profit on the margin that adjusts to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two holiday seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of consumer goods of first necessity grew more than 30 percent.
(However this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some staple foods registered in the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30 percent.
So for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, there was, in the worst case, only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all the indices, the suppliers of flour have a stronger position than those of egg, being able to impose the drastic increase in prices even to multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the golden trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers of the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking by pallets the preserved foods.
On Wednesday morning, large queues were formed in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that inside the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because the revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in that of appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year, several thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, primarily caused by the misapplication of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overloading of staff do not favor infection control, says the chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals, even disinfectants are saved.
Not long ago, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital earlier this year.
A man injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon after had to return to the hospital as a result of the contagion with MRSA and since then it has not been possible to perform a major surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his organism.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 cases of hospital infection caused by multidrug-resistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, department head of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections produced by multidrug-resistant agents has certainly been recorded, of the rest there is no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g., inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once it is over- or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics transform into highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and quickly spread in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, e.g. wound infections or sepsis primarily in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with the weakened organism, in the elderly or in people with low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the Hospital János there is nothing special in the infection of MRSA, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, nurses attend to them in rubber gloves and masks and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are pre-examined for the presence of MRSA in their body, but even so infection cannot be prevented in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital MRSA infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of formation and contagion with multidrug-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Because this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should screen hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA in their bodies.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient," said the doctor-head of the epidemiological center's department.
The European Union makes rigorous recommendations for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives for the treatment of infections and disease.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be done to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less common in the case of walking patients or in basic care,” said Karolina Böröcz.
Save money with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is transmitted from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, however also in this sense considerable faults are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted through drop transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
What’s more, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately you can also experience - added Karolina Böröcz - that in less favourable economic hospitals you save with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are implemented, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the contagion of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Program Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is fought against in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multidrug-resistant agents (among them MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative blood alcohol control of police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the commander of the police of district XXII has been made.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a stunned state can be excluded the since resigned commander of the police of the XXII district, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passer-by, said Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary blood alcohol control that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before putting himself behind the wheel.
The head of the police station of the XXII district on Tuesday with his private vehicle as he turned to Kossuth Lajos Street of the XXII district ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the area designated for pedestrians.
(The latter fact, that is, the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not extenuating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police officer resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also said the former police commander had initially collaborated with prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice President Marta Gajecka signed three credit limit agreements worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million in Budapest on Friday to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, to be carried out from the subsidy of the cohesion funds, of which the parties had previously signed a loan contract worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, the contract they have just signed refers to the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan contract is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this Hungarian target, on the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million will be decided later, when extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovations and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the issue of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
The agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will re-treat the issue of whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this could take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion of 113 projects in Hungary.
The interest on the loans is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for keeping the loan available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU’s real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that previously mentioned Balkan country.
What thing, where and who buy in the even cheaper EU market, will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments of the ski slopes and the chalets of the beaches.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
In the same way, the capital Sofia can be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, and can thus be a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the surroundings of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their lives and their way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Also present are the Maltese and Cypriot promoters and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in the ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100,000 euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15,000 euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, also for them is important the proximity of a big city, shops and usually a local doctor.
They constitute the second category of chalet buyers (Bulgaria in December was included in the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group are real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is constantly increasing, since the demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest property prices in the European Union, in the last five years they have experienced an annual increase of 21 percent.
The increase in the price of real estate considerably outweighs the growth in wages.
Fodor and the Six by Hundred Hungarians
As reported by the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor the expert level meetings will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at ministerial level on the post-2012 international climate regime.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are deliberating on the Bali Roadmap on post-Kyoto emission reduction efforts until 2012.
There are now lively discussions between developing and industrialized countries on this issue.
The United States has already indicated that for the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to reach an agreement that, compared to the situation of 1990, by the year 2020 the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological aid to countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, foreseen in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), writes the "Piac és Profit".
The Six by Hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to retain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from the 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the “post-2012 agreement” will be signed, and is willing to commit to decreasing even 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states committed to meet an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary’s commitment is to reduce by 6 percent the emission of greenhouse gases with respect to the period between 1985 and 1987, which our country will comply with – says the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
There is a lot at stake in Bali, since in two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because otherwise, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this case the UN Nobel Peace Prize reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of reduction of emissions, whose need was noticed in its latest report by the IPCC.
With this, the reduction of emissions would suffer a delay and could not prevent an increase of more than 2 ° C of the average temperature of the Earth, a fact that according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British army recruits on YouTube
British army units at a video distributor publish footage of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: special units deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are checked in Kandahar’s general body of operations, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been uploaded in this way to the Internet and its "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defense they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but inevitably has some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'être of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made a video game.
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the distributor, for example about the death of the soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers talk at most about losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fights.
In addition, the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have been uploaded to the Internet and numerous videos recorded in real operations, but the British army is only lately taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form of recruitment with freely downloadable shooter video games called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can stand directly in place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty cake at the Christmas party of ministries
Labour Minister Monika Lamperth doesn’t seem very sentimental: instead of the holiday party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with savoury cake and coffee.
There is ministry that will celebrate their party with live music, in another will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how power is fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, and at the Christmas of the Missionaries, the relatives of the soldiers who are currently on missions abroad will be invited.
This portfolio will allocate $25 million for the holiday atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and the six hundred workers of the ministry are expected to attend approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the wallet party there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be a tombola draw.
The ANF Christmas cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council for the Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the Lucy Day dance on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the greeting words of the minister and after dinner there was live dance music.
Answering the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear costume or evening dress.
The health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
Instead, Labour Minister Monika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a work meeting at the end of the year.
There are a hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will drink only coffee and savoury pastry, so the party will not cost more than HUF 350 000.
Minister for Local Governments Gordon Bajnai will instead simply toast with his colleagues in the Ministry’s classroom for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the reception with buffet and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres is the minister, the workers of the MF every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20, the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held in the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and as communicated by the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the one hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments have communicated to [origo].
In the press department of the portfolio of environment could not report on the budget of the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will constitute a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stoppage will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since rail transit will be completely halted and until 13 hours workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
In the afternoon of Friday, the League Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday, which they will hold jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
Also will be constituted the strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Drivers who will coordinate the actions of Monday.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means, that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the law on public health - did not inform about the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for a strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of Monday’s agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that the public health law will only be voted on in the very early hours of the night, or at best around midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: indefinite work will be stopped on the railways, in the morning a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the intercity transport of buses of the companies Volán may be stopped.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others indefinitely.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railways and the Free Trade Union of Rail Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day to 13 hours will be on strike workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike the LIG Unions of the Electrical and Thermal Energy Industry, the Educational Unions 2 called a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Union.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will strike nationally at alternate times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Sector Workers (SDTSSS) that are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is for the government to withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, for the case of advanced pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transportation on the railway sidelines and expect another proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: The Hungarian Guard increases the risk in the country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased from several points of view the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the company's "risk warning" it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is constituted by the fact that "with the aggravation of the existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They affirmed that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of the radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Roma and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country."
They remind us that: from the autumn of 2006 the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups in Hungary received increasing publicity and impetus, and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been established in the country that define themselves as "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civilian organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, of the army, that is, of the state."
They affirmed: all this is done in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
For highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, in many neighbouring states the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a similar way to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass riots of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to set up the guard, arguing that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain gypsy organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far has shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Gypsies too will react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense – can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, said: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and it has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that next year will be less - workdays are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America, holidays are not unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between a national holiday, a state holiday and holidays.
The festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical ephemeris.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is a holiday - the latter above all so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven holidays written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the State, on May 1st the Feast of Labor, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country are two-day feasts Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when there is only one working day before or after the holiday.
In exchange for the extended weekends, during the previous Saturdays you can not be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labor who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or following the feast.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and civil servants.
It is not compulsory for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work uninterruptedly even during holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the year: from December 24 practically stops life in the country, because according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with midday or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First the agenda will be modified around the Labor Day so that then, for four successive days, workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that in return Friday, May 2 will be a holiday.
The other change relates to the holiday of October 23: Saturday, October 18, will have to work instead of Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year during the end of the year party you can rest, since from December 24 you will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six small deterrents to make your colleagues’ lives bitter
Emails we forget to send, sound messages we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing it: all of them are part of our daily folklore at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
“I’m sorry, I forgot to tell you that you’ve been searched for in the marketing department,” says one of your colleagues.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to fix the issue, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message (this is the less usual solution).
Most of the time the issue is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to embarrassing explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can make your colleagues’ lives bitter and consciously endeavor to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, office supplies or your phone and you can’t find them.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen on the desk of one of your colleagues?
Do not take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for stealing their things.
Do not pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before time.
Do you gossip about the private lives of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what is he doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the private lives of your colleagues!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know the things about him.
Are you going on sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office on the phone and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or good, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others must do your work, your indispensible tasks, your work by term.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you should stay at home, let them know, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront you the next day.
Tinnitus, laughter, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but are you abruptly pulled out of it by your colleagues?
Have you involuntarily heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to hear?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your rattles, singing, conversations aloud (except when you do them above their head), patting, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontents aloud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not delving into a project right now (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something in time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
You don’t allude to the chaos eventually reigning in the office, nor to the noise your colleagues make!
You must acknowledge if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be distracted, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning jam.
A strange beat sounds on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I turn up the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the above tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a real jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays Zagar's song Wings of Love.
National musical life didn’t spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam seems totally different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2] digital [b3] national are gradually changing the image and although again is fashionable the rock style garage, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the ensemble of Yonderboi until he started his independent career perhaps because both can not be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, he tried to succeed, when asked for cinematographic soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider public knew of the ensemble that initially acted only in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, capable of selling itself also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his outfit are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether or not they are happy to wear this label.
The ensemble reacted as they should: they prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead will open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the early years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient ensemble of Balázs Zságer.
The reference about the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds loudest, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenaris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the mr2 channel Petõfi which recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought to the ears of the listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: what are you playing, to what extent is it a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally just for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the fifteen and twenty-year-old generations attend concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good to see more and more people attending our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career rather west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, even though they sometimes try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, rely on the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, since many of us started our career in his group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: In the hits list of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t intend to write big hits and sell our record with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it at the end of the record, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the record and the heavier tracks.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good-speaking soloists from our own national music stage.
Thus was created that choir of six women – namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh – which was later baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you compose exactly like that the song or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed long ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material of the album, we thought that something is still missing.
The chord attracted the song.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came practically on the first try and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I also needed the Divas.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), they have no role of their own, they sing all together and no more strongly than music, so music doesn’t just accompany their songs.
Also on the stage are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously didn’t want to distribute solo roles.
The song also talks about it, about forgetting for a while our ego, who from where it came and where it goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have liked to have others feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do the most work on?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition really none, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want the groove to work and then, little by little, everything was put into place like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and because I have already "released" the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is what he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Trade Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and undoubtedly with good abilities.
He intuited long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
“He has a fragile character,” his superiors, who sent him to the police, said.
But what is clear from Kerviel’s answers according to what French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, reveal is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he said.
Precisely in the summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity was already seen coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began about so-called sub-prime mortgages being offered to low-income clients or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those clients would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, its earnings exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I won my first $500 million, I didn't know how to notify him," Kerviel said, adding that nothing was left for him at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that their discovery would not be reached.
He even went so far as to deceive the bosses, even as the Eurex Exchange began to take an interest in their business.
Risk has become a benefit
Was he afraid it would be discovered?
Rather, no.
“I thought I had earned $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.”
Where did he get so much willpower to take such a risk?
In my position, I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
I knew I would never win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I already noticed that they looked at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this meant a boot mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
“This is like a snowball,” police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew of all this or that they rather suspected it.
"While making money, they closed their eyes."
Only then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day, he lost a billion dollars.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they locate him?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a vacation is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his file,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has the chance to get 365 billion
The Ministers of the Government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can get 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroner).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately SEK 125 billion will come out of seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the new entrant countries that use them the least.
Twenty-year sentence for former Nicaraguan president, court ruled
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua on Thursday decreed a 20-year sentence for the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 for the embezzlement of 100 billion dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to be placed under house arrest at his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002 will once again be behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will be up to the prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court showed how Alemán was constantly transferring government money to a company account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Some of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how we approved the budget.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, quietly approved the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Every government begins and ends with every chapter and budget item, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State Budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three defects that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as of expenses of the presidents that are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second of these is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State Budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, fees and credits from banks, often issued, meaninglessly, obligations to which they disproportionately indebted their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of which <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put order to the state finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to indebted itself.
The rest of the countries, except for a few such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan, or Egypt, saved far more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within global measures are less threatened by poverty.
That is why massive social programs are not necessary, which, unfortunately, in recent years have been uselessly swollen with gigantic measures.
And while they succeeded in eliminating some of the incomprehensible populist spending passed this year before the election, if the retirement age and pension reform are not changed soon, then it will be the end of any policy in this country, and whoever governs will only be a mere bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a bit, we can say that the politicians who govern will become civil servants, mechanical delivery of most of the money from the taxes for retirement and social benefits.
This is why this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the presidents’ expenses.
The planned deficit of more than $70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not wasted what it could in the last ten years.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become only officials so we must be patient and grant to this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is capable of obtaining from taxes and taxes, peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the crisis of the finance market.
Over one hundred billion dollars will be received through tenders in the Monetary Marking.
In these tenders the banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send out $40 billion to bid, and then another $24 billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest economic problem, namely the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to clients.
“This coordinated action by the central banks likely lowered the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, mostly in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks should really be afraid of what awaits them when they decide to take this step,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems with access to loans and therefore will have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend themselves money even as the Central Banks of the US, Canada and Britain lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another interest rate drop," Tempus Consulting's Greg Salvaggio told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism arose now with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
“The debates there are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, “often I only encounter the caricature of my ideas.”
Interested parties can now inquire about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that on the warming of the planet there is no agreement among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent possible disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable defenders of the environment but against environmental activists who do not take into consideration the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed the date and therefore did not manage to change their old driver's license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials will give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will find themselves on the roads without a valid driver’s license.
According to traffic, the license has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of license, the offices of the metropolis are full of applications and interest in the new license has increased.
The City Council estimates about 2,000 customers daily.
In the queues wait half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet been issued with the new driver's license.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card in a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their driver’s license and do not reach until the end of the year, but will take to the roads without a valid license will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the infraction with a warning.
In the event of an administrative infraction, the fine will amount to 2,500 kroner.
According to the above information, a person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices for moderate fines of a thousand crowns, at most.
According to the spokesperson of the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that every person must have valid.
People who don’t want to drive should hand over their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the licenses issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driving licenses.
People with the document from 1994 to 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's complicit detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych are going to spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The High Court of Prague decided as a definitive expiration the reduction of the sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the Prague department against organized crime were going to fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years.
Today’s decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also indicted in this case but he is awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance in the first place.
In other cases, however, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation in the robbery of 19 people and the Superior Court today dismissed 16 of them.
Most of the defendants’ allegations were dismissed by the investigation because they were fabricated causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped members of the criminal group avoid the penalties.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The indictment relates to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as the theft is concerned, its victims suffered serious impacts on their health but they are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without a gun permit.
At the home search, police found pistols, steel-core ammunition, a laser marker and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this trial, the court has already convicted Berdych and other defendants.
Other men related to Berdych’s case are still declaring other lawsuits, and in some cases have not yet appeared.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who have for now avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account to change a few children: 12 million
For exchanging children in the Maternity Hospital, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital’s legal representative, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, disagrees in principle with Veleba’s proposal.
"Such a demand we did not approve, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a termination value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>’s family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million kroner.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only it was prepared at the hospital of the Motol faculty in Prague.
The parents of the girls, according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry, suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stressful situation was better withstood by the men although they struggled with recriminations for the girls’ change.
Women take it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba added.
Veronica and Nicola were switched by the nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> Maternity Home last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermákov<0xC3><0xBD> to P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
The governor of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, gave at the end of October to each family 100,000 crowns as compensation for the error made at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and extraordinarily can ask the administrator for help.
The court so far has awarded them a proportionately low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily of a million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear today for oral hearing.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone comes to the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea has Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> as well.
“We have about 10 years of work behind us.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
“After years I have realized that the project is successful and that for this reason I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the trademark Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Polívka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
Then it was not a question of orienting him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comic origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> later created the society Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered his holders discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who were completely dedicated to it.
The collaboration, between the now decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetin.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Polívka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, culminating in the overthrow of "King Boles<0xC5><0x82>aw I, the Eternal Elect".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, resulted in the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company that has been rejected by the court to this day.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with his princesses, which is already preparing Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
From him should come the new king.
He did not want to reveal any more data or dates.
“We are not in a hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can come forward," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I’ve never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its steering characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is its successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a bit more advanced and I can only think of it better.
When I tried the classic five-door Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the headboard space in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer in front of the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I go through the interior quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value more the invention of design although already the car looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the 206 model, the side steering has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the body measures have grown.
In the Combi disappears the aforementioned shortage of space in the headboard.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This must be valued as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear door) and a well distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not disturb, and can be extended to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic regime has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot stays behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when placing the stroller of the child its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must cite the floor that remains quite flat after knocking down the backrests of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is what a 1600 should look like that would belittle the five-door family member.
It is quiet, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the <0xC5><0xA1>koda era then that seemed as if the exhaust pipe was capped by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested a vehicle that is elegantly equipped and has a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 by 329,900 crowns, you can still.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbags in the headboards, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but count on the complements of the team in the Fabia and it will reach a quite similar number.
It remains to be decided which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
Children from Eastern European countries attend English schools, so locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record those cases where conflicts between emigrants and children of natives increase in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between natives and Slovak emigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and brawls among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that police in Chatmam arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist-sounding insults.
Police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak migrant.
The girls treated him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
“When we were going home, a boy came up to us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to leave, he threw apples and pears at us, then pulled down his pants and showed us his ass," the Slovak student's mother told The Times.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with Eastern European emigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above, show us how the atmosphere in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 registered Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be met, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the whole enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island do you find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and brought to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that had criminality in the US (and therefore banned) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings emerged, along wide avenues were cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio left their signatures the stars of the world of spectacle and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita abánense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the dear Hotel Nacional you mix cocktails according to your desires.
And those cars already cult of the 50s, to this day continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rusted among these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surrounding area as there are there.
Other places metamorphose into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much needed money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
Sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow paths in steam or electric machines.
Their garages for decades were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sister models that are in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And for this reason, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned estate of Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing in limestone rock lands.
Mogotes, pylons of limestone and rocks of elevated escarpments in the falls of the valley, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the cigar factories in Havana you can find its final product.
Perhaps someone finds it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
Trinidad
Old town of Abolengo that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is a place so remote that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road that would connect it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built, and therefore nothing was destroyed either, for every person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby area such as Ancón Beach or the valley of the sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it as the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years later of the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was and that now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Anvil.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, the Santeria, African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, could fill many pages.
However, as they say, it’s best to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, say Americans
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment are influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defense Minister Robert Gates, should devise a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not working as expected, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to step up activity, Britain sees it as a priority to bolster the authority of the Afghan government and the sharing of development aid.
“Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one solution.
The next is to make it possible for the population that they alone can begin economic and security development," Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to US military data is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, a quarter of which are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
They are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months, there is controversy over whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For passive, Germany was criticized, for example.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands of struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The tabloid newspaper Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan rebels discover that Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a video accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph of the British troops playing a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will reach 1 trillion in 2009
For every Czech the state owes 84,000 kroner.
Total debt in September amounted to Kronor 842.7 billion.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the economy of the state budget.
The Czech Republic’s state debt grew at the end of September to Kronor 842.7 billion.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it has declined by 13.4 billion crowns.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt of early October.
For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 kroner.
Over the past year, the state has indebted more than 111 million crowns.
“For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year we could cross the border of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and one trillion kroner," Patria Finance economist David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, sees it: “We could spend the billion during the year 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If the situation in the political scene were to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don’t see such a change,” he added.
The doubt grows
The state debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The debt of the state is paid by means of treasury bonds, state obligations, direct loans or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
Foreign debt has so far grown from SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion kroner since June fell by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarter created 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform," said Pikora.
Better than expected
From the state’s payments and debt management strategy for 2007, it is extracted that the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, the ministry lowered the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to improved developments in the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the planned 91.3 billion crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.3 billion kroner, the reserve of 10 billion kroner for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroner to finance the obligations of the state and 1.8 billion kroner in payments of loans from the European investment bank.
I was comparing Khartoum in court today for giving a name to a teddy bear
The British professor tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting pupils aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
He was punished with a whiplash.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher working at Khartoum Unity High School in Sudan was detained at her home on Sunday and charged with attacking Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code as a result of several complaints from parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back in fact to the month of September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7 years, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
“Eight names come out of the children’s mouths, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "sorry only that I asked the children to vote for a name", it is according to him only an "innocent mistake".
Opinion divided by numerous pupils of the school teacher who describe her as " very attentive to her pupils " and " who never speaks of religion in class " ..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most widely given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger told a news conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence for now but we have entered a very difficult period," he added, noting that "evident tensions exist".
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province populated by 90% Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the UN Security Council, by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika was commissioned to mediate again by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, insist on a prosecution of the negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favor.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden where these "last chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has expressed some of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade particularly fears a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia," he said, "this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a right of veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had declared.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush strikes agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he himself convened Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately engage in negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old litigation point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations with respect to the path to peace they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues " .
This denomination covers the three main perilous issues of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be “global and deepened” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
On his return to the rostrum, Olmert pledged that the forthcoming negotiations would be "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set an end to the implementation of his " vision of two coexisting Palestinian and Israeli States " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment to this on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in his Arabic newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As each time in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspection of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car circulated on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but on patrol, and I was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating headlight," a police source explained.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, i.e. not authorized to circulate on public roads " (read below) and driven by two young men without helmets, circulated " at full speed " .
"It hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the pass to the right," the police said.
Alcohol control of the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (the front unfounded, windshield cracked, bumper ripped) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "facts of involuntary homicide and denial of aid" to the IGPN, co-hosted with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stadium, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the policemen, namely that this minimotocyclette arrived relatively quickly to their left " .
Yesterday, a type of groove, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the shoes on the floor, showed that both vehicles had been embedded in time for the police car to stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen had left the site very quickly, thus not providing relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being cautious, would also avoid " any serious misconduct " concerning this point.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigation, on which you have to be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that gives precisely to the scene.
“We immediately went downstairs with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to resuscitate them,” said this witness.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw "a policeman completely frightened, limping.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen have been driven by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, the rescue arrived " about twenty minutes after the march of the policemen " .
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not imply that police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first demonstrations since Musharraf's two-day state of emergency.
In the eastern city of Lahore, nearly 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stones thrown, injuring policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement picked up on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “urged the population to send flowers to the judges who ruled against the state of emergency and the waste to whom they swore in front of Musharraf.”
" Musharraf ' s Promise No Longer Fulfills "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly referring to the exception measure proclaimed Saturday afternoon.
He had to pronounce in the coming days on the legality of re-election in the presidential elections, on October 6, to the indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
"Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court," the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president "no longer appreciates" after the establishment of a state of emergency, Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of armies.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed a better "domination of fertility", according to the institute which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has gone from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple out of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) will have needed more than seven hours of work in space to perform the spectacular repair of a ripped solar panel indispensable for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "capped" by astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem emerged on Tuesday when astronauts had released from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece tasked with hosting soon European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began reorganizing the module’s solar panels that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And it is where one of the panels, which are deployed as accordions, has been damaged in about a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to make a control exit of the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to snail at the end of the 30 meters long remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to effect the repair.
He is one of NASA’s finest spacewalkers.
High, sturdy, very skilled, has a highly developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained doctor has been commissioned to "operate" the "wounded" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he sectioned the fallible cable and installed types of "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been assisted by the second " spacewalker " who had stayed near the airlock and, from the interior, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey stick wrapped with an insulator to prevent electrocution on solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "capped" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the interior of the station.
On Wednesday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a midday break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
EADS Securities Sanctioned on the Stock Exchange
EADS shares are currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its operating result forecast for 2007 in response to delays engendered by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditions the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any further encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS’s operating result failed by 86 % in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to delays in another programme, that of the very thick A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The election of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians are going to opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending voters a televised message about public networks, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as the leader of the list for United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory proves overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything get transparent by welcoming foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident,” he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign tainted by pressures.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziouganov says there is "never had elections so dirty, even in Yeltsin's time."
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections lie two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot seek a third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in both legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of homo sovietus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," estimates sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikola<0xC3><0xAF> Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: civil society lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin restored the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief,” estimates Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " renounce of their own free will the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved it after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite thinks to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) direct the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: " Why reflect?
Those in power aren’t too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are openly accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were hitherto not available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his rightful beneficiaries.
The eleven States in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research "particularly on the displacements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to the openness to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or of the detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the citizens deported or subjected to compulsory work and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Center on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India’s leading trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union’s foreign ministers had given their approval last April to the European Commission to start negotiations with the aim of signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India’s leading trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free-trade pact will greatly dope both economies" and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European commissioner said Friday. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services ", had declared this week Prime Minister Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi's Bar, feeling that the bilateral trade of India " has not yet reached its potential ".

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about easing the current turnaround of concerns over credit conditions, and announced a bid of <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion at the base index of 5.75% in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
“To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning December 6 in the form of an open market operation over five weeks,” the Bank said in a statement.
The bank said that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market as well on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time it seems that the bank England BoE puts on the market liquidities for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is " prepared to take further steps to keep interbank lending indices up to date in line with its base index.
The daily interbank index was at 5.829 percent on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny examination of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist “niche” (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, among which the increase of 50% of the bonus for employment, the re-establishment of the floating TIPP (internal rate for petroleum products), a check-transport or the restrictions of rents.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that resulted in exchanges, sometimes live, between majority and opposition a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more and no less, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place August 8-10 on a private 500-acre farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been in charge of the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, C3's Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as a marketplace and worked perseveringly with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-level politics because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional venue that, lately, will tend to take place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after having detached itself in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are more in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of country festival to the European way and urban to the American way. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow investing in such an event and hosting a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival's hotel offer is "very large," akin to the 80,000-strong Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under press.
“Vineland will taste like rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all sorts of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His fellow C3s, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It’s not easy to lure Hollywood movie plates to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best,” he says.
The race to the festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nonetheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskars has begun.
All West Coast festivals, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them value and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is set to premiere in Santa Monica at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? The experts, divided by the crisis 'subprime'.
With less than five weeks to go before the close of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year experts are not so clear that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, more so because in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favor of the stock market to take a lane in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight towards quality values in both long and short tranches".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of oil and the danger of stimulus of inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," says the expert.
The Ibex has lost nearly 4% since its highs on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert points out that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the Constitution Bridge.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the U.S. regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
Analysts are confident that these are positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be in charge of taking the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that “this year is about great values.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some construction companies "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banco, assures that the rises will come from the hand of the banking and industrial sector.
Builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, should it happen.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a bearish month.
The real year-end rally was in 2003, an exercise in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December registered a rebound of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 8:30 p.m., and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that follows the schedules of shops.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
To attract private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, freelancers and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers on the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the space of the branch and a new design, more current, with more luminous colors.
The head of commercial banking, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although it does involve a greater hiring of personnel, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that rightly so, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax premises will not repeat the model of BBVA, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've made it."
With that phrase yesterday expressed his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closing of the market, when he noted that the chain he runs was doubling the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: 'it is what hurts me, not because we have grown more but because we have fallen less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we've fallen less.'
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That gain puts its loss in what we have been doing this year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday gave up 1.52% and accumulates a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounted to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (Five Days editor) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we monetize it in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television network to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this announced figure becomes real, the television network would register this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antena 3’s net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million) while TV’s net revenue grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative evolution in the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría shared 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is too early to make the decision, this ratio could vary following the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent Mediaset.
"We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to whom we have already added value with 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is showing signs at this time of some tiredness.
Lehman Brothers recently cut its earnings estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It is due, they explain, to the reduction in projected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
This same firm has lowered the profit forecast of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

The Congress approves the transposition of the MIFID, which entered into force 1 November
Parallel to its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by Congress of the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim that both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to guarantee the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
The MIFID, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of financial markets, while reinforcing investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and encouraging cooperation between the different supervisors of the European Union.
The new rules will allow financial advisory services to be provided to specialist firms as well as to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (FIAs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and holding companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of operations on financial instruments, so that the regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with the current exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all the transactions they carry out, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage through the Congressional Economic Commission, several modifications were incorporated, among which it highlights that securitised debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of U.S. high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that can be performed by graduates in Economics and Business 30 years after the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists was approved in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work for a third party, will not require authorization from the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting customers to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI rises five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance of how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the one employed for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the forward indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the definitive data, which will be released on December 14.
CPI will continue at relatively high levels
The second vice president and economy minister, Pedro Solbes, has said that the rise of 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has augured that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that "even if the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy acknowledged with respect to the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have dropped more than 50 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time it was amassing record deposits of over <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that has progressively fallen in two and a half months due to the mistrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money that the Government offered and that it will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to raise about a quarter of the revenues in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to get those 18 billion pounds remaining until reaching the target of 30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as its favorite to rescue it from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the council secretaries and the police chief of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then councilor of the municipality, and that according to sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the "leader" of this plot.
Agents continue to search the municipal offices and the Department of Urbanism and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As reported yesterday by Cadena SER, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore aforado, was stopped leaving the domicile of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are detained.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the elections.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the PSOE list for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that he has held this afternoon in the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes it seems" that the politician Manchego will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace as president of the Congress Manuel Marín, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run in the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting against climate change in the university field.
The former minister has acknowledged that the prime minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he has pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he succeeds, Bono hopes to make the House "the house of respect and not of insult or screaming" and make it "more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can not speak quietly and quietly is the Congress, the President of the Government on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
Likewise, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his place so as not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "arrogance".
Climate Propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change subjects both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles to merciless persecution, it is bound to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach obliges him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has decisively contributed to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in which sectors it has occurred and why your government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires him to explain with maximum clarity to the Spaniards what are the measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to make, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been and there will not be such explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for corporate and individual accounts.
Even the penny of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not intend us to ride a bicycle or cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hospitality businessman for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose offices he is currently with numerous agents, who have also come to the Department of Urbanism and the municipal company of management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests add to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the case, which is instructed by Court No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees went to court today.
As the sources have informed, the former councilor of Totana and today autonomic parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former councillor, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was detained in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Soil of Inmonuar, an agency integrated in the aforementioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven searches, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested at the time in Totana, namely the owner of a poultry company well known in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks in the streets of A Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way at the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of the book of Blackburn:
“The content of the Philosophy signature has jumped into public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of Jokela’s school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Minister of Education in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague passes information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of crimes on Internet downloads:
A. The downloading of a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs worth less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 in the store, it is considered simply missing (article 623.1).
B. If you steal in the store up to 1,000 euros, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still less than that imposed on unloading (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than that of unloading (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous brawl is punishable by three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would be punishable by six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without authors’ permission is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's getting a hand, a very long hand.

My GP drops me one of his rare research papers titled, ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less.’
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly salary of workers depend on what the colleagues earn.
The study has been conducted by tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, study author and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and their partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if when they both got the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one got twice as much, the activation was higher.
I don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on that list from which the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, ‘La lista de Carla’ (2006, not released in Spain) which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fugitives and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in case of possible accidents, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which states that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the greater the likelihood of an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
It is for this reason that both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as the statistics reflect that they have a lower accident rate due to their prudence.
Also, using the counts, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use that is given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it the probability of having some type of mishap.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 find themselves with various disadvantages when it comes to taking out insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and seniority of the license.
Although the ideal to be well insured is an all-risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an all-risk franchise, so that they get the coverages of an all-risk insurance but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the customer would pay a part of the amount of the loss.
"The part of the amount of the loss that the customer contributes will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, head of Spain of First Europa, online insurance broker.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, but not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
One piece of advice.
If you are under 25, try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, being able to reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base fee.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonuses," explains Noguera.
After 25 years, it is easier for drivers to take out insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended is to hire a franchised all-risk.
"Normally, young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired when it comes to utilising themselves in an accident, and even when it comes to driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the rookie' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable to negotiate full-risk insurance, as long as your economic situation allows it, of course.
On the other hand, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk one with a franchise (this can be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They carry out a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to afford to assume a greater amount of franchise,” said Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is advisable to have an all-risk insurance with a franchise (being this one of 150 euros), or one to third parties extended when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in case of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to adequately study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic are looking for a point in Milan that is worth the octaves
Milan and Celtic are measured on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the league of the 'Champions', as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians scored ten points and already certified in the fifth day their pass with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that Shakhtar, with six, and who receives Benfica, which has four, does not ahead of him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan have to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where they make their debut on the 13th in the semi-finals in search of a spot for the final on the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to come out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossover in the eighths.
Gordon Strachan could even need a loss to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because at nine-point tie the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct match.
Thus, the Milanists will try to make the night bitter for the Scots, who are confident to enter the eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were defeated in that round last season with a goal by Kaka in the overtime (1-0) after the 0-0 of the first leg.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who only deserves the victory, in case he loses Celtic, both to get into the octaves and to stay in UEFA.
And is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which would play UEFA.
20,000 People Attend First Spice Girls Tour Concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at Vancouver's GM Place stadium that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people sold out to witness the concert that included a video telling the story of the group that made furor in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects his main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls came on stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowded GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had forbidden him days before.
Victoria Beckham said: “I haven’t seen our costumes at all, so I’m nervous about what he’s going to think of the show.
"Sporty Spice" whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
“I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “things have been fixed and we all love each other very much.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies awaited them.
Among the five, there are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), in San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will perform on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk that it will affect the export of the fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
An earlier dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on how much money Ukraine was to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would charge Ukraine more, as it has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40 percent more for Gazprom’s imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
“The changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian nations.
The NHS will have to prove foreign workers.
The Scottish NHS needs to check the criminal records of employees outside of Europe, one guard said.
Auditor General Robert Black’s recommendation came after a foreign doctor was found to be linked to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no idea exactly how many foreign personnel it has.
However, his report pointed to other checks being carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor general checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European Economic Area in the wake of the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep into the gates of the airport’s terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in Britain.
NHS expects to conduct pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses “Disclosure Scotland” to conduct criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The auditor general’s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
“While we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available on the number of NHS foreign personnel."
BMA Scotland President Dr Peter Terry said it was “highly unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment check-ups work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that verification procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely complied with.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide for foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was of great interest that this work was carried out in the wake of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups — including foreigners — which they planned to release next month.
Joy Division dominates in film awards
Control, the biographical film about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the Best Picture Award.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller “Notes of a Scandal.”
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film, which features soundtracks from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was produced for only <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
But Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s two-time best director and debut director Joshua Tree album, also went on to win.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning film at the ceremony – such as Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, which won the award for Best Documentary.
The Best Actor Award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver for a head of the Russian London Mafia in David Cronenberg's film Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fiftieth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones' "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named after Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it’s really an honor.”
The Independent Film Awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa festival supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 militants from terrorist cells planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television of the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the Abqaiq facility, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who has entered the country.
The minister said militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining as al-Qaeda militants to fight allied forces and back the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heretical by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants – recruited by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to harass the country’s pro-Western government – were targeting foreign government-associated residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, since five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus Climate May Give An Idea of Earth's Future
Venus may have once been a fitting place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is sufficient to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results from the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer an insight into how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, says: “It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
“Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police seize "enriched uranium"
A kilogram of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still remains open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy of presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record video questions and send them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions presented on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the Republican YouTube party debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party ahead of next year’s election.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to showcase candidates for aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the issuers noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The hardest exchanges of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a leader in crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney’s reputation as he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an “amnesty” (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the chance to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, came to terms with the issue.
Neither has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with China’s fear of toxic toys and other concerns about the outside world, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble to the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the Whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now, against all odds, first in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is rising in Iowa, coinciding with Liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns and his heated statements from Wednesday’s debate.
They have both come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the game is divided and the result is far from clear.
Dolores Laboristas
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
No influences seem to have been sold, no exorbitant hotel bills in Paris, no extramarital finger-sucking.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour Party of more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) for nearly four years using fake names, and that the party did not denounce him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister evaded calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by stating that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The bailout of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has pitted business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative mess.
A trio of retired generals began a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means Mr. Brown is irrevocably walking towards the exit.
Governments can come to a turning point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is on the defensive and not focused.
On the one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the treasury.
And even though it’s not directly involved in Blairish’s mishaps — or “partnership cash,” the investigation of political party financing — voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has been killed or scammed directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to gifts of charity, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not his.
The laws against anonymity for big political taxpayers is clear and exists for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham’s deal, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the head of fundraising who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these actions, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter — conducted, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Standards Commission on Public Life, as he hasn’t had one in six months, and he must also push for genuine reform of party funding.
This will require hard cooperative labor by Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions — bitter measures for a partisan like Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks Cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural for dorsal fins to swim excitedly around.
Today, with the U.S. housing market in crisis, predators have their eyes on the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 million charge in its U.S. consumer finance business, in part due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delinquency and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a ratings agency, the third quarter crime rate of 3.89% was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American People’s Bankruptcy Act (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of default) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports solid payout rates, which show how much of its debt consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is quite firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that lenders are out of date.
But credit card issuers look more at liquidity flow than asset values, so falling prices don’t necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ creditworthiness.
They can even work to outperform the issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the loan value; and as a result, the payment of the card debt rises on the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders face by changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset retaliation.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, head of finance at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit contraction pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
Those dorsal fins must continue to be monitored.
British bankers convicted in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility in the frauds with Enron's former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow were convicted Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a covert financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC at the Royal Bank, became a notorious cause in Britain for the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were for having alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a myriad of frauds at Enron, which helped its spiral of bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary’s interests at zero, but the three Britons knew it would value higher.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the bank’s interest in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers collected $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two counts of conspiracy in the Enron collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that was required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting trickery, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses look successful.
The collapse caused thousands of jobs to be lost, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were charged last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
“It has capacity for up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, Gulfstream’s representative.
“But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for family private flights or for company presidents.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cockpit last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day drinking orgy held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had set up their exhibition stands, hoping to attract wealthy new Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany-crafted yachts to diamond-embedded car grills, worthy of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer watches cautiously a bright orange Porsche on the stand next to his own.”
“It’s a beautiful car, but it’s nickel and cauldron compared to us,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second-largest market for private jets.”
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived the same thing in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, a senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s biggest consumers and spenders.”
The world’s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to Forbes’ list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian billionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think tank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jeweller David Morris.
She attends the fair for the first time alongside the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
“Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon attire, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit she wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The show aims to attract the new rich, the kind of shoppers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum feather cutters, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand of the royal Dutch porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, the sellers said wealthy Russians of more background (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from striking logos to limited-edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people – cash millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists – fill the aisles every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of mattresses for $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said it had sold three chain bracelet-shaped car grilles for Rolls-Royce Phantom at $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded with Swarovski crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase “Russian millionaire” does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it’s not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who weren’t millionaires could at least pretend to be rich with the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with piles of one-million-dollar counterfeits.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire’s Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karryev says.
"House" Surgery May Be Cause of Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the "A Little Healthier" restaurant and saw an ambulance climb up White Cape Cod, two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
“Then I saw the ambulance come up,” Mr. Livingston, the restaurant’s supervisor, said on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the Newark police department director.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue home.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting for the toxicology test although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help solve the mysterious death that has grieved the upper ranks of the Newark policeman.
Ms. Arroyo had been an aide to the chief of police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” McCarthy said of Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me.”
McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and who left behind two children, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the County Union prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
“That’s one of the possibilities,” Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said the house arrived about 3 p.m.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door in Mrs. Castro’s home, where a withered rosebush is located in the front of the house, and a barked Dalmatian in the back.
A blue drum labeled "vanillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - lay at the door of the garage, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang on hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the NYPD department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this one or that one,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to lift the stock market.
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market waited for the federal reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which rose with reassuring comments from the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
Stock exchanges loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, chairman of the reserve, declared that policymakers must be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to continued tension in financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Kohn said the recent turbulence was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October."
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of further adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that hit the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at close to 13,289.40, while the S&P 500 broad index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at close to 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of Britain’s top companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit tension in the markets was highlighted after a strong demand in a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained credit and three-month loan rates "Libor" among British banks, meant it the highest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England takes to trial the lawsuits of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the team that is on loan – with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is starting to fill with offers to become a national selector, and if not, one part time.
The one who does not get the sixth place of bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and so is the sport.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than for ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, as judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is this the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, had been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level is for a cricketer, unless they give him a chance to sink or swim the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to capture the captain's eye while taking a wicket and a hitter to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player one day.
But catching the eye of the pickers is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who plays surely in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for "fit and bowls" as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races each to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more from these.
The games of Shah or Bopara in the stadium of Asgiriya may be only a matter of opinion.
The choice can break or make a man’s career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every test and did well in the firsts, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to settle at the same time who came to become a player of importance, and despite scoring a double cent against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion in today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of early 88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class versus only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent record against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two rounds in May against the West Indias in the Lords test, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the pickers when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, he seemed to have taken from his "batting" some momentum than in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has joy in living on swords.
He gets caught up for nothing on the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he overturned his vehicle at an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching from a distance, to say to him with excitement, “Did you see that?”
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he hits with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work – and the Fight Against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, driving out exiles who ran out of cash, no visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that is safe now.”
“They say that Mahdi’s army has stopped killing people,” he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to cease temporarily.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite who teaches in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with her two children because it was impossible to renew her visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in her country.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him over the phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped pull al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my comrades.”
“That’s why I came back today,” Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62, said.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops established groups of “concerned citizens,” armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned because of visa denials and a lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, voiced common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian death gangs.
“We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, easing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will resurface sectarian tensions and the struggle will begin.
The little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines for the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sarrians lack only an educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French" - that was the ironic bike about themselves of the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the education system of the Saar that in a study of the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
In this way, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students coming from the Saar is above average in higher education, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
"In the Saarland, the system of vocational education is exploited," says Axel Plunnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economy (IW).
More than five young people complete their baccalaureate at the Vocational School. Thus, it turns out that the Saarland is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety and range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced higher schools to advertise more for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in general education schools,” said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative tests across the country.
In order for the children to start studying the final year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, it does not have any cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show if the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students who are behind in school development fell from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But overall, the Saar did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the displeasure of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sarrians are not French, the language of the neighbours is a compulsory subject in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon there will be another time zone in Venezuela different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez lets the time change in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Currently Chavez is staying as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will pass to less than four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States once imposed the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
“My dignity doesn’t allow me to do it,” says Chavez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where the country’s citizens must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe to withdraw the mandate of Chávez in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which it was about the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said that Uribe’s decision offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chavez in Spain.
A new ringtone causes a sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?", is the phrase that half a million people have already downloaded.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decline in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong economic situation.
Experts present a plethora of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to Hans Böckler Foundation calculations, German employees should have a lower real wage account in 2007 than the previous year.
"The fault of that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase of the value added tax and the spike in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Cycles Research told Bild newspaper.
The new unemployment insurance burdens may also fall on employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" newspaper that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% by passing from one year to the next is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the labor office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician from the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday, it was made public that the rate of inflation with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level in 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: Earth's twin brother.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that until now had not been posed. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and whirlpools at the poles, the same that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers had suspected that there might be lightning on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays are silent from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous Urey-Miller model of the origin of life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms may have provoked reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it’s not like that: if there ever was life there, that would have to be in one of the earliest states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface temperatures of 500 ° C reign, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
“Possibly, Venus is a ‘diabolical’ Earth twin, but it’s still a twin,” Russell said.
The main goal of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so Earth-like in mass and size, has evolved so differently.
Since since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest research results to be presented in many Nature papers, according to the researchers, underscore not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also demonstrates that neighboring planets have more common features with Earth than we had assumed," ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, the researchers discovered in the south polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high atmospheric layers of the Earth’s poles, according to a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet also called dawn star or evening star orbits the Sun nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and atmospheric pressure of 92 bar does not resemble Earth much, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
The two planets had agglomerated water that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated into the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had turned into carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the September rally.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany’s reputation and that is why he demanded that the grand coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation,” Koehler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
“Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received when carrying out a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his disgust at the reception of the Dalai Lama and because of this was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in the Sino-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Minister of Finance, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Police battles in the streets, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not take to the streets.
Barricades were made, vandals shot police with rifles: after serious youth riots in France, the Federal Minister of Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We also have to be careful that the social problems of our country do not take the form of violence.”
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hanover.
Not all young people are involved in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits.”
It’s too early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The youths staged serious riots in the streets with police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitative effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of all this, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above average.
Care must be taken to ensure that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is a great social control in the families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says: "But despite everything, we have to be careful."
It is necessary to "provide the opportunity for young people to receive a job or vocational training more quickly".
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a helicopter with lighthouses flew over the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as garbage and cars burned.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take rigorous measures until necessary.
On Monday night around 80 policemen were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The riot began in a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the deaths of the young people were not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The action far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more can be expected from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach that had been made to her for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy activities, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that that would be a provincial mode and thus showed made it clear that he does not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the Lower House, it was stated very clearly and explicitly to all that this reproach was appropriate.
There could be no slightest interest or any kind of feeling in the country’s problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke put it this way: a very high policy that runs away from foreign policy and stays there achieving nothing in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself very much for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these goals should be achieved here on climate issues.
In general, this way of praising herself – for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
For he engages in expressions so that an impetus reaches people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without leaving the branches.
But in Angela Wolke’s realm, inner problems are appearances of little value.
Poverty of children and concerns about low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about it using subordinate sentences.
It is amazing how often you get it wrong when it comes to the supplement for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
He begins to stumble "as if he had been in an unknown territory", when it came to more concrete information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of YouTube’s Republican presidential pre-candidates and now must fear only one candidate from the outside.
Tensions between the candidates have been evident from the beginning.
Mitt Romney reproached his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani responded to the former governor of Massachusetts by saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers, saying that he was the one who took the illegal immigrants.
Candidates tend to attack: as so far the Republican group has no clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their adversaries.
The short 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were uploaded to Youtube, also don’t have much content.
“With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” that was John McCain’s reproach to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one of the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from Vietnam war veterans, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that meanwhile the campaign’s most important topics are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates over torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied raising taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“At that time I was wrong,” Romney said, apologizing to people and television audiences for having advocated abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf ruled without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
Thus ends the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pakistan’s president Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after taking power with a bloodless military coup, the former general rules the state for the first time as a civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the oath Musharraf will very soon annul the state of emergency and will fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since the Supreme Court proclaimed a state of emergency, there have been many lawyers who support Musharraf, and last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals ahead of the controversial new election of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Wathyristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release, a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written at the band's best time.
At that time they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of him his box, his cables and especially his buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking from the auditorium, is 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Rodelius, who is very busy with the control panel.
Everyone contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock fans was the fact that the band Harmonia came back to make music.
What has to be revealed here is the following: the precise questions have shown that the name of the band resounded in people’s minds, but it was not something so special that after 32 years the audience missed it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the seventies?
Especially because the Krautrock misconception was always more valued in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a music award "Echo" to members of the band Can 2003 from Cologne for their life's work, in the room you could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouths with amazement.
Later Michael Rother would spend time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance at home and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at that time did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Already a while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a time, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians from Cluster into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the sixteenth century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more of an artist’s life full of surprises.
One day, they say, an Ottenstein Harmony singing association banner appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about knowing yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording participated almost 50 people.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and make rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is contrary to custom.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up getting into esoteric themes and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and since then has been more successful than Harmonia.
The live recording of the album on Griessmer, that is to be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set itself the goal of cultivating this German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius' work, the band Neu! was also rediscovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all of Krautrock's influences on the following pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno’s phrase accompanied by the special music fills the room: “This music is the only certain music, it belongs to the future.”
There are photos where Harmony with producers appears on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in black and white photo projections, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing more than attach the microphones to the organ and the drums to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Nowadays, electronic music is the way it should be.
Three people who go deeper into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere you cough, you whisper and in a good moment of emphasis you sing "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was already a term of English origin.
It was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts “68!” here is right, too, but now Harmony is calm.
The scene reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
That can break one’s nerves or give one quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to the war in the Balkans.
But the two weren’t very convinced.
Either the concepts are fixed a lot on actions and shootings or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkan Mountains, but it was precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women’s movies and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important plot to perhaps watch the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles nowadays have to be so long and silly?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the eye: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have already passed, who as a monument to the ruin of his decadence retained until now most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a nutshell: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because in reality there was never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard on two counts), the story about American reporters in the war who go to detect a Serbian war criminal named “fox” could probably be a new “Apocalypse Now.”
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army can not do and each time it turns out a trip in madness.
One reason for the failure of “The Hunting Party” is when they first introduce us to Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Bosnian Muslim that they will kill later.
Then “The Hunting Party” is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters of the world could not achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to take revenge in a fair way.
It is so bad, that they make you want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in reality, a profoundly human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really worried about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, that one thinks of a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is about a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be evil".
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently a newspaper published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiasco.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
There’s almost always a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or minefields, then something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arguette, “Across All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Bloody Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to take at least decades until Hollywood makes a good film about the holocaust taking as an example the film "Schindler's List".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the Vietnam War plays "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because writers don’t have the slightest hesitation (which is necessary to be able to) to tell good stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Great Dictator” turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn’t know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don’t have to be a good person to make a movie.
Perhaps we must be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant gaze of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That is only because some things never change".
The great cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust received negative criticism of the Olympic Games in response.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and the economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director-general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, on Wednesday said the resignation was "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
“Without this objective, we could not maintain the political, sporting momentum at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg’s ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, it is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust says on WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December, on Munich’s request for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity.”
This dream, however, did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut’s remarks.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity be taken away if at this point the plans are ruined," Günter Ploß, the director of HSB, said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the request is contradictory to the statement of the head of the senate made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Sport Federation of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated the Hamburg application for Universities 2015 not as "a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Higher School Sports Federation named Hamburg as an application candidate.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the senate for not taking advantage of such valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the senate was delaying the development of the small Grasbrook neighborhood, because it was planned for the Olympics or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for the little Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU underlined the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg’s request for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Gloss-Boxes on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" cast doubt on the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm conducted internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hultén museum in Stockholm also gave to the international museum of Moderna Museet, are fake, and almost one of them.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", he painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that had cartons of soap powder "Brillo".
According to Warhol, at the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet hundreds of Gloss-cardboard boxes were exhibited. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but specimens (which were only objects) on display.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed the production of glossy wooden boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "type Stockholm" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him were produced and exposed.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the chief curator of the Moderna Museet museum, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and grinded their tight silvers and then they painted them in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the year 1990 shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the tightened silvers. In addition, it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from the official Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes list,” says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet museum, adding that if the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York fails to reach any conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as the copies/objects of the exhibition.
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in which they are boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment on everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president for corruption and election fraud, told a reporter he could not answer for spilling blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been entrenching themselves in the building for a few hours.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial Thursday for attempting a 2003 coup that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 supporters.
Evidently the military police officers who were to watch him had passed into their ranks and followed his mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blockaded the neighborhood around the Hotel Noble.
The president called for an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Advisor, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
“People are fed up,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to come to our ranks.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said the other military troops would soon want to follow the march.
Major government critics called for a major demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months his government has been blamed for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven attempted coups against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel’s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares in telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price for a share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was much speculation about the company’s absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial part at Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entering the business, after bank Brendenberg increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution holds equity securities for a third-party partner.
United Internet already on the previous day engaged with almost 10 percent the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital increase measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has purchased 5.15 million shares of them for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31.4 million.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperations.
“We strengthen our collaboration,” the United Internet spokesperson explained.
The two companies founded a joint venture MSP, to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that in the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, they involve 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant that both companies retained all the options, especially the participation in the Freenet public limited company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet over a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This “game” with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now, the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held a direct 6.01% stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
