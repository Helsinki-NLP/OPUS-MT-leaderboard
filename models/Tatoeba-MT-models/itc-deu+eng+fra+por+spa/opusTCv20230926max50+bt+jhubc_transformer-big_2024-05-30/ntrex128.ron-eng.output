Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they could give the impression that they are "puppets"
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed because they have been suggested to change their title, namely to be called MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly within the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political stage fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party in the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he is “ripping with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "feces".
A member of the Welsh Party in the National Assembly of Wales said the group "is not delighted" on the whole and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said the group had an "open" attitude to the name change, but noted that the "MWP" resembled the "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales just like the English letter "u" spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the 'Parliament of Wales'.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly in Wales, the Commission preferred "Wales Parliamentarians" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option received the most votes in the public consultation.
Members of the Welsh National Assembly have reportedly suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could give headaches to Elin Jones, the chairman of the governing committee, who is expected to submit the bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee’s system.
Members of the National Assembly will have the final say in their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote on referendum to change country’s name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion on the change of the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens government has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider this vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is just a compromise that will allow him to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin’s Episcopal Church have stopped ringing as a result of problems facing the churches in Harlem
“Historically, the veterans of the place I talked to told me that you used to find a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there are no more bars or churches.”
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he said.
“Bars no longer serve as a living room for the entire neighborhood, where people usually gather.”
And as for churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of goods will be spent faster than leaders expect and that, “sooner or later, the outcome will be the same.”
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who would not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “therefore this will speed up church closures because it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis for African-Americans – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist congregation, consisting of white people, moved from the area after 1930.
A congregation of African-Americans, who were carrying out religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin’s Church was taken over by a congregation of African-Americans, led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting African-Americans.
A fire that occurred in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it and included carilion in it.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, called the carilion "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who commissioned the carilon in July described it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical tool".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said it was the world’s first carilon performed by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carilon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story, which has included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish, composed of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the sacristy, even if it was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained of the lack of transparency shown by the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Trying to Catch Lobsters in California
Authorities said on Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he swam trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a little boy crying out for help and then moved along with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought the boy was thrilled to have caught a lobster, but then realized he was yelling "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The entire collarbone was torn, Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
“I yelled at everyone in the water and told them to come out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it was not a species of shark that poses a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper trunk.
authorities restricted access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles also noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury Retailer Plans to Strengthen Its Position in the UK Beauty and Fashion Market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing beauty departments in the style of a universal store with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a consolidation of its position in the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow, although sales of home and fashion products are not up to par, larger rayons with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into more stores in the next year, if it proves to be successful.
The investment in the beauty industry comes as supermarkets are looking for a way to use the space previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s said the number of beauty products it offers will double, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its makeup range, Boutique, which means that most products are aimed at vegans, a growing demand among young shoppers.
In addition, the products of French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury chain for testing, the first being opened last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second half of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food every day at the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of retailer Sainsbury’s, said outlets will look more and more like universal stores as supermarket chains try to cope with the fight with major discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has included both products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores and Habitats since acquiring both chains two years ago, meaning it has seen increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty compartments has failed.
Sainsbury attempted to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ended after a divergence over how Boots stores' revenues would be divided into its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business, which included 281 stores, to Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s retailer, said: “We have transformed the look of our rayons with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to give you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations make us an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Is Angry After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Contract
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of “This Morning” announced on Instagram that she would be retiring.
Holly Willoughby sparked the fury of Peter Jones, the protagonist of the show “Dragons‘ Den,” by retiring at the last minute from their lifestyle services business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was angered when one of the most beloved people on television admitted Tuesday, during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, no longer allow him to dedicate himself to their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and objects.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have nearly doubled Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would quit his contract for Truly, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It was going to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, it was just a short time before the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at the Marlow facility that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the host of “This Morning”, which is among the best-selling stars in the UK, could bring millions of damage to the company as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible additional delay of the launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby co-founded the Truly brand with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as director in March.
The couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very tough, and then "we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from journalists for making a comment that some would consider “unworthy of a president” and about the fact that he has such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
He said Trump imitating a “newscaster” voice.
“I haven’t taken a step back.”
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have ceased.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not noticed a "proper response" from the United States to North Korea's previous disarmament efforts.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on it.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
“Everything is going well with regard to North Korea,” he said.
“We were headed for a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He also said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: the cessation of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of the US military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to behave like a president, but if I were to behave like that, instead of the 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this small arena, there would be about 200 people,” Trump said.
An Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, a necessary condition for international relief efforts.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a rather difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to relief efforts.
Given the quakes Indonesia has endured constantly, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be insufficiently prepared for the rage of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not very often encountered on other coasts.
It appears that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a tsunami warning was issued, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, traveling between islands in Indonesia turns out to be a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate this.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has set himself the goal of improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign, and has allocated heavily for roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds has affected the administration of Joko, who will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from sectarians in Indonesia as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims clashed on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the saver goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while about 30 metres from the opponent's goal, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before kicking in the direction of the goal.
The ball reached above the box, heading towards the top right corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball passed Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and fell into the goal.
“I just had to try to get in the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as far as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn’t think much about it, I just took the ball further.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue team's forward sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, then returned to the middle of the field and ran towards Liverpool's half of the field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move into the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who went into the square.
Hazard overcame the defense and sent the ball into the net, managing to hit it with his left foot and pass Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will have a match against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami reached 832, according to the national disaster agency on Sunday morning.
Several people were trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday that triggered waves of up to 6 meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, has been covered by debris caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing a woman by stabbing her.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stabbing wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street and a man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen something related to this subject to come to the station for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I appeal to all people who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who have heard or seen anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful material with the help of the on-board camera to contact us if they have information essential for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a Birkenhead woman and was found on a property.
This afternoon, a few people came to the crime scene who believe they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police say they are trying to inform the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few hours before they were allowed in.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene, a woman appeared in tears.
He repeatedly said, “It’s so awful.”
At 14:00, two police vans were in the perimeter and another one was outside it.
Several police officers were standing in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the latest memorial to be affected by altercations over "rewriting history"
Removing it would be poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about removing the statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many think is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation, this is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
But surely the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure who represents a part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead after an artery was cut and covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui square in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday editorial of South China's Morning Post.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines to pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly came with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby bunk was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Medical examiners confirmed that a pig weighing about 300 kg caused the farmer’s death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were full of blood and torn,” the cousin, whose last name is Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking someone else, while police gathered evidence from the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and authorities are apparently negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
10 years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and drive the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions.
“It’s just playing.
They like to bite, they are very curious... they don’t want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is decreasing in intensity as it moves into the cooler waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa records wind speeds of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday at 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a depression zone has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push intense tropical moisture from the north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical moisture that will interact with the depression area will generate heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall ranging from 3 to 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams, and possibly desert landslides.
Intense tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of between 5 and 10 cm is expected in the southwestern part, especially in most of the Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to conditions of rapid deterioration as a result of the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rain could cause the canyons to turn into violent rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local winds into gusts and dust.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rainfall to areas off the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of nearly 2 cm is possible, which could result in minor waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of Sunday and the first part of Monday, before the rain spreads more Monday evening and Tuesday.
The intense rainfall will spread to the so-called “four corners” on Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
There will be intense temperature changes in the U.S. in October as the Arctic becomes colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. are observed.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to experience a warm beginning of October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in large areas, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a high chance of above-average temperatures for the US East by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people have followed the press statement backed by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, with TV stations interrupting Friday's normal schedule for breaking news: an agreement reached between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the allegations, for a week.
Ford told the court she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had harassed her while he was drunk and tried to strip her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, as part of an intense testimony, said he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a play-off football game or Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daily hearing.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters yelled at him and he was trying to get into an elevator at a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stared down for a few minutes as people scolded him, and everything was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling us the truth?
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Television later broadcast live voting on the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to review the allegations against the nominee next week, which minority Democrats demanded.
Flake was largely convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter.
Flake's election was an important one, and it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of 'political games' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside the man with his photo on the front page of the newspaper, former prime minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on her Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect tariffs on each other was “completely ridiculous”.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Shooting LSU Player Deadly
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of a second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have released footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police have said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde deadly.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Bureau of Forensic Medicine released a preliminary report Friday, saying the death was caused by a gunshot to the head through the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana police force, the state police forensics lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest in question.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20.
The 1.98m tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This worries me all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano has thrown a column of ash over Mexico City.
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have arrived in the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexico’s citizens on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after activity in the crater triggered 183 emissions of gas and ash within 24 hours.
The center monitored more hums and vibrations.
Social media footage showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano that lies 72 km southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clash between Catalan police and separatists ahead of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote, rallying thousands of opposition demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away from gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The brawl escalated later, with police using their sticks to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We do not forget, we do not forgive", while Union protesters shouted "Long live Spain!".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants to become independent a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose, overwhelmingly, to become independent, although voter turnout was low, and those against secession boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, with violent clashes taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia’s independence.
“Last year I had some of the best moments of my life.
“I watched my parents crying for joy that I could vote, but now we have nothing to do,” he said.
Despite a vital but tight victory in the regional elections last December, pro-independence Catalan parties have tried to maintain momentum this year, with many of the best-known leaders either in exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“As a candidate for the European elections it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Several men arrested after driving into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car broke into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and even the building.
At one point, a crossbow was used against the car.
Menga's kick helped team Livingston win 1-0 over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers undefeated, with Steven Gerrard reaching his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard’s team is left without a away win in the Premier League this season and faces the Hearts leaders, trailing them by eight points next Sunday.
Prior to this, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the division until six games, with Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against harsh visitors
Holt's team was supposed to advance long before scoring, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and tried to kick on goal space, then Alan Lithgow managed to kick wide after slipping in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause visitors trouble at free kicks.
And that was how the crucial gap came about.
The Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston managed an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to pass Menga, who kicked and scored from the centre of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated possession, but faced the host's impenetrable defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not much bothered by the rest of the game.
This pattern of play continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Allan McGregor of the Rangers, and Lithgow took a wide shot from another Livingston player.
The diagonal passes continued to come into Livingston's box but were unsuccessful, and the two requests for penalties - after Halkett beat Glenn Middleton and after a break - were not accepted.
"Fun Game" offered by Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and team have not changed since returning to the top, but the merits must be given to Holt for the way he has coached his team since he took over.
He had so many patterns to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren’t very inspired.
Although they have performed well since being led by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The goal passes were unsuccessful, they only managed once to catch the goal of the opponents free, and this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the rankings.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Cologne
It was all pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at remedying relations between NATO allies.
They are unhappy with issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters gathered nearby to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, mostly Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him with open arms in the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the division over a visitor considered a hero by some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies in collision with a car
A bicycle rider was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped and paramedics showed up at the crash site, but the man died at the scene.
The crash comes just months after another cyclist died in an accident on Childers Street in which the driver ran off the scene, which is about a mile from where the accident occurred on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in the area, the bus route is diverted, and motorcyclists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Fight
Six prison officers were injured in a fight at a high-security male prison, a prison official said.
On Sunday, a brawl broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m.
Specialized officers were brought in to handle the brawl, in which eight inmates are involved, isolated in one wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “The assistance of the prison’s specialized staff has been requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical attention after being injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period behind bars.”
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last year, in October, officers dealing with the unrest were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, the staff being attacked with billiards balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded due to Hurricane Rosa (dry areas can enjoy benefits as a result)
A tropical depression rarely occurs in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwestern desert, posing a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of Monday it will cause precipitation.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix announced in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state over a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix in the 1950s!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action at a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center’s latest models predict rainfall of between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
In other areas of the south-western desert, including in the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities of between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with possible total quantities of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas, torrential rain will be beneficial as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least a severe drought, the second-largest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which still had hurricane power on Sunday morning, with wind speeds of up to 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm will encounter cooler waters in the Pacific, and therefore will diminish.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Heavy rains in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high risk of flooding.
"Torrid rains of between 8 and 10 cm" are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can reach up to 25 cm," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north into Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is extreme torrential rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to produce sudden flooding, which will endanger people’s lives, and bring waste streams into deserts, as well as landslides into mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stabbing wounds in Somerset.
The teen was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and one 20-year-old boy were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers asked for help from citizens who might have materials on their mobile phones, namely to report to the police station.
Trump says Kavanaugh faced “dissatisfaction and anger” from Democrats
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh faced the Democratic Party’s “dissatisfaction and anger” during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford’s claims of sexually harassing her ten years ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her claim.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw that day the genius, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best legal minds of this generation,” he told the West Virginia crowd.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not running, but in a way, I’m running,” he said.
“For this reason, I express my positive opinion everywhere about the candidates that I consider to be outstanding.”
Trump said Democrats are on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a GOP executive assistant told CNN.
Hundreds Killed by Indonesian Earthquake, Number Rising
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them by the huge waves that hit the beaches when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu on Friday when waves six feet high hit the beach at dusk, sweeping people away and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat was broadcast yesterday, people were still seeing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, thus becoming victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for BNPB’s disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami brought with it cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled offshore at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting shore.
He added that some people had to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centers in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency show several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges toppled and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the World War II Hiroshima atomic bomb.
The geographic structure of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, probably intensified the magnitude of the tsunami, he added.
Nugroho described the damage as “extended” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of victims were found trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which lies closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were “completely disrupted, with no information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was harshly criticized for failing to inform that a tsunami would hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In social media posts, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building shouting frenzied warnings that the tsunami is approaching to the people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate authorities' rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still need food and other basics.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu for Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in makeshift shelters in the office yard, they skipped devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they saw many houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Even though aid groups have begun to initiate disaster relief, some people have complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, material delivery and personnel can reach the site of a disaster only if it is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can begin international assistance, but nothing has been announced yet.”
After the second night of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and families of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescue personnel released a woman who had been under ruins for two days, with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the paragliding pilots missing.
Other captives at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Given my experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community was broadcast, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to competitors in Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in front of his messages only a gray tick appeared, not two blue ticks.
“I think that means the messages were not transmitted,” he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while fueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to carry more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man “flew behind Brink’s back” and stole a bag of money to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity is asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changed his stage name to "Ye".
On Saturday, he made the change announcement on Twitter: “the individual officially known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old has been called "Ye" for some time and uses it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he expects to release his new album, Yandhi.
It comes on the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled "for emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West has previously stated that this word also has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s about us.
It all started from “Kanye,” which means the one, and it came to “Ye,” which is a reflection on our good, bad, unclear things and the whole.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are as people."
He is one of several rappers who have chosen to change their stage name.
Sean Combs has had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
And a former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with an inkling, sometimes without, as well as in big letters.
Mexico's President vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, López Obrador pledged at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to repress the Mexican people."
The troops fired at a peaceful demonstration from the marketplace on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those who study and by opening several free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for AI
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on artificial intelligence research, says Kai-Fu Lee, the artificial intelligence investor and user who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even though the U.S. lacks an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be at the forefront of AI innovation by 2030.
“Double the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and that we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next big achievement in AI will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the American player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later served as executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee appreciated previous competitions from U.S. governments in technology, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China putting sticks in the wheels of academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. step up its AI efforts.
“I think doctoral students in AI should automatically be given a visa,” he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called “AI Next.”
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, there have been no changes in U.S. law aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the country’s name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a change that would settle a decade-old dispute with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring country represents a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposing nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign cast doubt on attendance and may not reach the minimum limit of 50% needed to validate the referendum.
The question on the ballot at the referendum will be: “Do you agree with joining the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?”.
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted into entities such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament said they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum is required in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of people with the right to vote voted.
“I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje, the country’s capital.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted for the referendum on changing Macedonia's name, which will allow him to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small-sized scene and pulled chairs in front of tents erected by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our foreheads up, not at the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the majority will be in favour of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU,” Zaev said after voting.
He said an outcome in favor of the name change would be “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with the right to vote will participate in the referendum, under the necessary number of participants.
According to another poll, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote for change.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-western government’s policy since it took office in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to pass the whole defensive of the Brighton team and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to overcome Brighton's defensive edge and secure Manchester City's 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He moved very quickly between three defensive players at Brighton before reaching the free side of the field.
Then Aguero woke up surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to pass a defender, and then overcame several opposing players on the sidelines of Brighton.
After that, he gave a pass to the left, the ball reaching Sterling.
The English forward sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, managing to evade Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is having a few leg problems," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But Sterling is the one who got the initial advantage for the Blues in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero scored a pass into Brighton's territory at that stage.
Then he gave a pass on Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane dribbled the ball several times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it towards the goal.
The Azuri striker hit the ball to the net just before heading off the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc in the game against the Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the play-offs, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday in the game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still play-off implications for the Rockies, who hold an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least one unpredictable spot with a 5-2 win over the national team on Friday night but are still trying to keep their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver alongside the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level at any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these circumstances?”
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the match on Sunday but, according to sources, is inclined to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be in the opening shot of the 34th game, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will pitch under normal conditions on Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has an 18-7 score and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 losses in 220 and 2/3 games this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding the Supreme Court's decision on Brett Kavanaugh while discussing the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“All our efforts are at stake in November.
There are five weeks to go until one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, I’m not running, but I’m actually running, that’s why I’m trying hard to support good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “Look at this awful, radical group of Democrats, see what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by using any necessary means, you can see their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control, that’s what they want, to have power and control, and we won’t give it to them.”
He also said the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“And you can see that in the last four days,” he said, describing Democrats as “angry and evil, naughty and lying.”
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is part of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was heavily bullied by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
What's that?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different point of view.
People who express their opinions are no longer tolerated.
I was not surprised at all that the Momentum activists in my local party supported the motion of no confidence in me.
After all, I am just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received a similar treatment because she was vehement about anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, the motion of censure was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, on which Jeremy himself did not share views with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday’s Nottingham East meeting of the Labour Party stated that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
For much of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evening were like this.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a “better, gentler” political environment has long been forgotten, if it has ever been respected.
It has become increasingly apparent that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things have started to be that way since Jeremy became the leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common view on politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree with some things I would not have agreed with before, including national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public, whatever I say, there follows a wave of abuses on desocialization networks that demand my removal from the party, denouncing center politics, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my colleagues, because comments about myself tend to be political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different points of view within the party, and with every motion of censure or change of selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible on this issue.
Many people have advised me over the past two years to put my head down, not be so vocal, and everything will be “good” that way.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence of the Thatcher government led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor or minister.
I never hid my political views, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can say that he is unclear about my views on the policy and the issues I disagree with in relation to the current leadership.
To those who backed Friday’s motion, I can only say that in the context of the country moving towards Brexit, which will affect our households, businesses and local services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for the citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise that no threat of elimination from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions I consider in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the football team Ayr reaches the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late attempts somehow influenced the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today’s highly interactive match in Tennent’s Premiership.
It is now in the top of the ranking, being the only team without any defeat in the ten.
Eventually, it all came down to their better defense, as well as the fact that they took more of the odds, which helped the host team and pleased coach Peter Murchie.
“We’ve been through several tests during our games so far and we continue to be unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “The merits are given to the Ayr team, they took advantage of the chances more than we did.”
The 14th-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, who played for the Warriors, allowed Melrose to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the match, managed to score, and then managed to turn an individual attempt, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson’s essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes because of the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off the field with the stretcher, and since the resumption of the game, Ayr has been unleashed through the attempt of the player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr team captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the backup player pay with an untransformed attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a terrible pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for plating Climo without the ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo turned the test, as he did again near the resumption of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" move and sent extreme Gregor Henry deep for the host team's fifth attempt.
The star of the sitcom "Still Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the sitcom “Still Game”, seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC’s beloved show, writing the script and playing alongside his longtime partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, the one with the number nine, would be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, though a source from the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "developing restaurant industry".
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings fly the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
We have to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no way out to sea, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive – just as the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the outcome with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ’s decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that after decades of firm talks, Chile is forced to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic president – facing a controversial fight for next year’s reelection – also has much to gain from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that too little would change if it happened.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the territory that belongs to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes just six months after the final pleadings were heard indicates that this case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And not only did Bolivia not succeed, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric weakened any residual Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end the 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most beloved presidents – was using the maritime issue as a political backing.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get over the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it can’t trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke about it at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of resuming diplomatic action on the nuclear threat more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an “irrealistic dream” that continued sanctions and U.S. objection to the declaration of an end to the Korean War would ever make the territory of the North yield.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many skeptics who do not believe that Pyongyang has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris showcases the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for hats to expand your collection or to completely protect yourself from the sun, you no longer have to look.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
The non-practical hats have conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion designers have sent the creations that steal their eyes to the podium.
The piece of resistance of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant hat, beige, with a wide, feather-like edge, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories have included melons adorned with beads, a sorcerer’s hat, and even a pineapple, but these aren’t designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of Hannibal Lecter's chosen accessory, rather than haute couture fashion.
One of the creations appeared to be a diving equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while another appeared to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a fashion style, with oversized clothing items, you’re in luck.
Stylists predict a return of huge hats in luxury fashion stores.
The oversized hats come back after the appearance of the “La Bomba” hat, the straw hat with a wide bow, seen by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the non-practical hat that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely the straw bag for the beach, with a size as large as the model in bathing suit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ spring-summer 2019 “La Riviera” collection at Paris Fashion Week
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer because the fashion designer had such a powerful impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record for academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained a Higher A degree certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as a subject, hold the same as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for reasons employers gave for the fight to fill vacancies, 17% were attributed to a language skills shortage.
Therefore, more and more, language skills are becoming imperative for preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That’s why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With more languages, especially in developing countries, children will be more likely to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn the languages that are considered most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be more languages of choice in independent schools, with teachers who specialize in this field.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done (it has to be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play still remains to be settled.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to get ready,” he said.
Time of Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled next week, which include stops in places where the electorate favors him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his candidate for the vacant seat on the Supreme Court is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to bolster support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s election rally in West Virginia take place tonight and where can I follow him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. East Coast time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election in West Virginia online via the live video stream below, on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, a hearing that has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate’s expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week for the FBI to investigate the allegations.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain some ground.
President Trump’s campaign said the role of these five rallies next week is to “energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important to his schedule that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won the election by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is led in polls.
“The fact that the president came to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team is determined and continues to fight to maintain the chance for the singles starts on Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it’s possible that Saturday afternoon’s foursome was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever swinging pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, especially in the case of competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
“They were leading us by six points, now the gap is only four points, so we’re counting on this drop for a little bit of motivation,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are twelve points left to play.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are enough reasons to encourage them, the most important of which is the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won three out of four points each.
Spieth sent the balls over the green area with lethal precision, setting an example for his colleagues.
Those festive guttural howls became noisier as the round advanced, especially when he scored a crucial point by which he tied the score in the fourth game, after he and Thomas had been driven by two points after the first two holes.
The shot that won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar scream, a scream that makes you believe that the American team still has chances.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth says.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but adorable couple have won four out of four games and it seems they can’t fail.
“Moliwood” was the only pair that didn’t need any extra hits on Saturday afternoon, but that’s true for Saturday morning, and Friday afternoon, and even the nine points on Friday morning.
This performance and the way in which their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic public reinforces the opinion that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they carried out a potential victory of the Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both simultaneously, at different holes.
Discussions about the glory of Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs event, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
An additional shot and two doubles at the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep that they were not even close to coming out of it.
On Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The samples of fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and worth watching closely due to the interactions between pairs, the advice given and not given and the way a strategy can change on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe lead 10-6 in final day of Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant lead after ending Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two wins against a hesitant Tiger Woods, which increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American players who made many mistakes at the morning fourballs event and won the series with a score of 3 to 1.
The U.S. put up more serious resistance to the foursome, where it won two games, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 singles games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and along with Molinari, a pair dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to win four points in four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they backed up superbly to defeat the discouraged Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score of 5-4.
Woods, who struggled in Saturday's two games, had occasional genius splashes, but has so far lost 19 of his 29 games at fourballs and foursomes, seven of which have been consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourball session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1, the world's first and third positions.
Europe, however, has not had an unhindered journey on this pleasant and cool day in southwest Paris.
Triple major tournament winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2–1 match against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then returned later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursome after losing their first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in the singles, although, because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being in second place two days in a row, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament as long as there is no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extending sanctions would deepen mistrust in the United States and that it is impossible for its country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the Global Council that North Korea had implemented “significant measures to prove its good faith” last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t trust our national security capabilities, and under such circumstances, we can’t unilaterally disarm first.”
While Ri repeated North Korea’s familiar objections to Washington’s resistance to a “staggered” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took step by step, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first-ever summit between an incumbent U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress toward a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered assurances on North Korea’s security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not responded to calls to ease harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on the ‘denuclearization first’ option and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, even objecting to the ‘declaration of end of war’,” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion that only people who don’t know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: "If the issue of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even in these circumstances, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target U.S. territory with missiles from North Korea after “the evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with “total destruction,” praised Kim for his courage to start the disarmament process, but said work was just beginning and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned period for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the corridors of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit has not been successful.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but after just a few hours, North Korea denounced that he had made “gangster threats.”
At a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a rocket launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and that he wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Courses on How to Get Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing “macho” culture that makes them undergo “all-night” learning sessions, energized with a lot of caffeine.
One scientist found that students at the world’s most prestigious university often don’t even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on the ability to learn.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I being told this just now, in the last year?’
She told me she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
An hour-long course can involve a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the image of a dorm room is presented, and students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep schedule.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
“We know we can’t instantly change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” Czeisler said.
The culture that makes students proud that they learned all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be a student’s “secret weapon” for combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that the body is starving, which makes students feel that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical biology and physics, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his first year courses at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to require all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before enrolling at this institution where competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm to know when it is time to go to bed, as well as for waking time, and to know what are the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffer another case of depression on the move because Dolly Menga's shot condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted their first away win since their 4-1 win against St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, putting the Rangers eight points behind the Hearts, the authoritarian leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and the uninspired Rangers players never seemed to be able to equalize.
The Rangers thus fell to sixth place in the standings, while Livingston climbed to third place behind the Hibernian, a one-goal difference.
And the Rangers could face other issues as cough referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the visitor team’s fans’ lawn.
Gerrard traded eight players from the lot that easily won against Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 Livingstone players who managed to draw a draw with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained batch choked his opponents throughout the match.
Even though the Rangers had superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more effectively.
He should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first pass propelled Scott Pittman to the gate defended by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her past the bar.
The Rangers took control, but left the impression that they hoped more than they trusted their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have gotten a penalty when he clashed with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
The Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not disturbed at all by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingstone's 34th minute goal did not follow the game's trend, no one can deny that it was deserved, even if only for the effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep centering of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed Menga, who finished with a single shot.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he traded Ryan Kent for Coulibaly; this move almost paid off immediately, when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the goals to block him.
But Livingston continued to lure visitors into exactly the same type of match he preferred, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting center after center.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the finals, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' shot, then Lithgow sent his head over the corner goal.
Rangers reserve Glenn Middleton demanded a penalty towards the end of the game when he struck Jacobs but, again, Thomson disagreed.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of our Sunday morning Almanach: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the count CONTINUES...), is the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as was the case in the film "The Bells of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboys with unlikely inclinations to science:
Man: "What's that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these helmets, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, you hear a lot of bangs!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to ‘Detect’ Harmful Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “detect” harmful cells and destroy them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can ‘detect’ a protein common to many cancers and then be reinjected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab so that they can “detect” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "determines the growth of several cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and “teach” them to target cancer cells, also worked for treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a diatribe of support for Trump while wearing a MAGA cap after appearing on SNL.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was hounded in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a brazen show in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he plans to run in the 2020 election.
After performing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, the artist unleashed a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a screenplay starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's diatribe footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to tease West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They tried to intimidate me behind the scenes.
They told me, ‘Don’t go out wearing this cap.’
I've been assaulted!
They also told me I got very low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see how low I got?" and then he said, "I'm going to get Superman's mantle, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments attracted snubs from the public at least twice, and members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; one person from this team told the publication: "There was complete silence in the studio."
West was invited as a late replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song I Love it Dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits among us: THANK YOU FOR FACING THE MOUNTAIN."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West simply “was himself and that’s great.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I think embraces and expresses an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that he is now "the being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in the footsteps of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the "artist formerly known as Prince".
Accusation of attempted murder for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defence lawyer is expected Monday before the Belfast Court.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO-produced medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on screen makes the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt “something went wrong” and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be handled in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, said he was “very determined” to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m very determined to talk about it right now: Where did I go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What have we taught men about how to be adults, given the problem we are facing now?”
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What do young boys learn from TV and on the street, what makes them think it has to be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something's wrong with young people."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not play in any series based on Game of Thrones after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying that "he's done with the battlefields and the horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard’s play True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him thanks to the series Game of Thrones is that he met his wife, Rose.
“I knew my wife when I made this show, so it secured my family’s future and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played Ygritte, the girlfriend of Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the multi-Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted sexually, unlike those in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to the next, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually end up marrying a woman.
Many of the cases of disease transmission stem from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked GOP senators’ data, talks about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were made by analysts and “far-right” websites.
“Lies, lies and other miserable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The information disclosed included the addresses and personal phone numbers of the senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a Supreme Court judge.
The leak came shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and disclosed the information to a member of Waters’ team, Hill reported.
“These unfounded allegations are completely false, an absolute lie,” Waters said.
The team member, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded allegations are completely false, an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he does not have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
It must not question the motivation of the accuser.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to that of Justice Kavanaugh, criticized by Democrats, who said he appeared a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who runs against Waters in the midterm elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
“Important if it’s true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted “appropriate authorities and legal entities to these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are uncovered,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members.”
Johnny English hits again: no-nonsense spy movie parody, starring Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to search for meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the series of parodies of the action films that has as main character Johnny English, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returns.
Will this gossiping satire of how weird we are become the nation’s new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with the gazing eyes and the rubber face, has been renewed for the second time the license to spoil everything. The name of the character means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the cinematic audience in the non-English speaking countries.
He is, of course, the grumpy secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of that guy who contributed a single note to the musical theme of the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympic Opening Ceremony.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious countryless man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard TV commercials, which has left chaos behind.
This last adventure of JE also has one or two cute moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet lightly.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is rather weak and, oddly, superfluous, especially because "serious" films, such as those in the 007 or Mission Impossible series, confidently offer comic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be aimed more at children than adults, and to me, Johnny English’s wild adventures are not as inventive and clever as Atkinson’s silent movie gags when he plays Bean.
As always, the premise is that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret web-based spy network and revealed the identities of undercover British agents, much to the desperation of the service agent, an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a pompous and besieged prime minister who is already suffering a serious crisis due to the decline in political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can with her Theresa May-like character, but the script doesn’t give her a chance to shine.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she must activate a reserve agent.
He is the zealot of Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a school for the upper class, but he also gives lessons on how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute bunnies, because English runs a school of rock spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, then reunited with his longtime partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, in which the talent of Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So, these Batman and Robin of Mischief in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, taking on the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s IT problems: sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of bachelorette adventures: disguised as waiters, set fire to a fashionable French restaurant, create chaos when he sneaks aboard Volta's luxury ship, then English triggers anarchy in pure form when he tries to use a set of virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with his homes.
This latest sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colorful the film is, it looks like a children's television production.
Pretty mediocre film.
As with the other Johnny English films, I can’t stop wondering: Can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
Labour denies plans for British workers to work four days a week but get paid for five
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems the party wants company bosses to take advantage of the possible savings from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not change.
Sources say the idea would “fit” with the party’s economic program, which wants to tilt the balance in favor of workers.
The shift to the four-day working week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: “Announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a fitting aspiration in the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall strategy on industry.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party’s promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not party policy and is not being taken into account by the party.”
The Lord Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “profiteers” from utility companies.
The Lord Chancellor's plans for the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supplying regions may not recover their shares in full, because the Labour government may collect "deductions" due to detected crimes.
He also confirmed plans to appoint workers to the company’s boards and create ownership funds to sell 10% of private-sector firms’ equity to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on 60 Minutes whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh would change their minds
The FBI’s investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s allegations has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for Supreme Court judge by at least a week and raises the question whether Republican senators could be persuaded to stop supporting him because of the FBI findings.
In an interview aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his colleague in South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I have said this since the beginning of the hearings; I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when that happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, ‘Are you guilty?’
The answer was decided, prompt, unequivocal.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to have been dug into the stone.
“I’m determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so some explosive charges would be needed,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett resolutely dismisses the allegations,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people named by her confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt anything will change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that will be attended by an impressive group of stars with an equally impressive mission: to eliminate global poverty.
At its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will draw tens of thousands of people to the Central Park lawn, not only to watch artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event, the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to pay for a number of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help raise awareness of the global goal of elimination.
But how successful was the Global Citizen Festival when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism, a concept that refers to people who feel they have achieved something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011 there have been more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, which have promoted different goals.
The organization says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, under which at least $10 billion has already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries who have committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” which has pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the book of history,” Tracey Ullman, the Power of Nutrition ambassador, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been carried out in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced that it will fund The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road, sometimes we’ll fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists to perform at this year’s New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use naval forces for a ‘blockade’ to hinder Russia’s energy exports, Interior Secretary says
Washington can, “if necessary,” use naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argues that Russia’s engagement in Syria, in particular where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason I’m in the Middle East is that I want to intermediate the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
“The United States has the ability, through our naval forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade so that energy does not come out on the market,” he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went on to compare the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, saying of Russia that he “knows only one trick” because of its fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said the US’s fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we look at things the same way: energy cannot be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position drew criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with a third state intervening in our energy issues,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'seriously thinks' about running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday that she must “think seriously” whether to run for president after the midterm elections.
During the meeting at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that it takes a strong woman,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to run for president.”
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the mayoral meeting, saying he had “turned the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was a vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "it's normal that we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that even the majority of Warren’s voters don’t think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “likely” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential nomination of him and 48% are against.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would formally decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome at a Donald Trump Rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case.
“The things my own son went through after he returned... I can understand the suffering of other families who are feeling the ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome and the aftermath of the wounds our soldiers are returning to,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "return a little different, tougher, back wondering if there is any respect for what they and their soldiers in the military and air force, as well as all other members of the Army, have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing a report of domestic violence and holding a drunken firearm, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims trying to escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus curiae petition in Washington on Friday to support a challenge to asylum-seeker policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his violent sons, gang members,” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-appointed attorney representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing a pervasive problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Council on Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle,” the amicus curiae petition reads.
In addition, the lawyers argue in the lawsuit that the policy of denying entry to immigrants affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape gang abuse and violence.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11, when announcing the policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the death toll has doubled, in a race against the clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became worse and worse.
“The situation seems very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who is comforting her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded assets, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, were overtaken by the situation.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to the spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are being treated outdoors due to strong and continuous aftershocks.
He has tearful eyes when he remembers how the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my son.
I hope I'm safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘abuse’ of ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using U.S. media to distribute propaganda materials.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China’s supplement paid in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 congressional election, an accusation China rejects.
The allegation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to run commercials promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a mounting trade war, which involves waves of tariff hikes for imports.
The tariffs imposed by China in revenge at the start of the trade war were created to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, China and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continues this abuse by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“When it disseminates propaganda by publishing an advertisement in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government fails to respect America’s cherished tradition of free speech and a free press,” Branstad writes.
“Instead, at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent views that Chinese citizens have on China’s worrisome economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was about.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from multiple sexual abuse charges, analysts have warned there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal have been extremely strong, and most Republicans who discussed it publicly intend to continue the vote.
“Such reactions will not be forgotten,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November Coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate halls when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh’s nomination process despite testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be very great,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
“People say they were already very big and that’s true.
But they could be even larger, especially among the indecisive female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed allegations of sexual abuse brought to the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested he might follow a backlash if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
“This has turned into a mess for Republicans,” former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, it's about how the Republicans dealt with this situation and how they dealt with it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democrats' electoral support group, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided as to which side they should believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly believe or believe that Ford’s testimony is likely to have been true, while 35 percent said they strongly believe or that Kavanaugh’s testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh abused her drunkenly at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Set Up a New Internet to Compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee’s open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “global dominance.”
“Now we have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data archives” or PODs.
It can contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this “personal consolidation through data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute the appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely screwed up all of a sudden.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the internet neutrality debate.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Internet,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The Cleric Who Won the Victory Cross in World War I Is Celebrated
The only clergyman of the Anglican Church to win a Victoria Cross medal as a fighter in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled Saturday by his two grandsons during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “wonderfully symbolic” that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very dense fog and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "fantastic bravery", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked a nest of artillery himself and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to match, but that makes me feel humble.”
This, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a wreath after the parade, which was conducted by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to play a part in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but received Peppa Pig cartoons instead
Imagine that you were up all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, only not to be able to watch the main event.
The schedule of the San Jose event contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, viewers in the UK were amazed when the broadcast was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not happy at all, because they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
One fan described the move to children’s cartoons on Twitter as “a kind of bad joke.”
“Government regulations say this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Pig Peppa, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future they will schedule their events in such a way that they can also be watched by spectators in the UK.
“When I think about replays, I think we could probably work it out,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won’t be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to go down to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We've tried to give fans more and we've crossed the line.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feeling 'Inferior' to Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn’t realize until he got to school that “not everyone is like me.”
Invited to Lauren Laverne’s first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the traditional show, will be missing for several months due to an illness.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that as a child he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls."
He said, “So far, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, it was the real things that gave me the strength and endurance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove he was “someone,” he said, so he wouldn’t let everyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a renowned supporter of LGBT campaigns and has taken advantage of this year’s Commonwealth Games appearance in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt fortunate that he could live freely, without consequences, and because he wanted to give others “hope.”
The triple world champion said he was “taken by surprise” by falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley was married last year to the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age gap was never a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age,” he said, “he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14 and his father died of cancer after three years.”
In June, the pair became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, Daley says, changed their “whole perspective.”
“If I had been asked last year, I wouldn’t have been interested in anything but winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if they had received tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t say, ‘You won’t be able to be first, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and died that I finally accepted that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that's what I've dreamed of a lifetime, jumping in front of spectators in my country at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired him in the music of his choice, Proud by Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still moves him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, was put on the reserve bench on Saturday in the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays in his forty-seventh Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to get back into good form so it's not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the U.S. team, the five-time major tournament winner split his day between being a cheerleader for teammates and practicing his shots, hoping to right what he did wrong.
The 48-year-old has never had the straightest drives, even in the best period of his career, so it’s not the best choice for the narrow terrain at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish incorrect shots.
And if the field isn’t challenging enough, in Sunday’s ninth game Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who has teamed up with novice Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points to the entry in the 12 singles matches, which must start in force at this stage.
Furyk said he was confident in his player’s ability, but he couldn’t have said anything else anyway.
“He fully understood the role he had today, he hit me on the shoulder, he hugged me and he told me he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he would play in two games.
I imagined more, but that’s what happened and that’s how we thought we should proceed.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for most Ryder Cup games.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never risen to the level of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s smart, he likes to joke with the players, he’s a great guy in the team locker room,” he said.
“I think young players are having fun joking with him, it was fun to see them doing that during the week.
Its role is more important, it’s not just about the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane debuted in the 1997 Valderrama game, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but barely managed to defeat them by a minimal difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remember that we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win,” Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team win 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
“So history shows me and my team that it’s not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at full speed.
Let’s go out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We always said, we have to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we also know what awaits us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the way his players handled a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow is a completely different situation.
Tomorrow the individual performance is important, and this is different.
It’s great to be on the pitch with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re on your own, then you’re tested to the fullest as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, that they have to be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes his players will play better in the singles event than they did with their partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing one when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medina".
“I remember every word,” he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfield matches.
We’ve created the right batch and we’ve ordered the players the way we would like, you know, we’re trying to create a little magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
“I chose this group of players, in this order, because I think they cover all the topics,” Bjorn said of the batch for the singles.
Germany's new warship postponed again
Germany’s newest naval frigate was supposed to be put into service in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but this will not happen until the year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The entry into service of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new class of frigates Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but problems after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is assumed that they will be provided with a powerful cannon, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technologies, which provide a radar, infrared and acoustic footprint reduced.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for the new frigates to be able to leave on missions lasting two years without returning to the original port.
However, the continuing delays mean that these state-of-the-art warships, which are said to increase Germany’s maritime force, will already be outdated before entering service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was discussed in the press last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available on the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of crucial “software and hardware defects” that would have rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the oldest frigates in the Bremen class.
In addition, the ship was found to be too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future equipment.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty mechanisms, the price of the entire project, including that of crew training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates take on special importance given the latest warnings that Germany’s maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in Germany’s parliament, acknowledged that the Navy “has begun to run out of ships that can be sent on missions.”
The official said the problem has grown steadily over time as old vessels have been taken out of service without being replaced by new ones.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class had entered service in the Navy.
National Trust spies on bats' secret lives
New research that is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how bats use the environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will look at common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as ear bats and water bats from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and what species emit certain sounds.
A habitat map and a report will also be produced to create a detailed, scaled-up picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grass creation, and what is the best way to maintain forest pastures for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by the construction and development work that affects their nests, as well as the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and street lighting are also risks, as are flies traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who periodically conduct studies, control nests, and sometimes conduct rescue missions.
The organization even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of bat in Scotland are found.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
“Here at Threave, the area is great for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to multiply."
It stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing property maintenance work, as the mere unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and young, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know how populations evolve for many of our species."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges against him were "fake news" and that some people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker from Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman identified as Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
Hours after the allegations were published, in a video posted on Instagram Live to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said they were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in front of the camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to become famous by using my name, but I'm used to it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called “an inadmissible report of privacy suspicions.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for “moral damages equivalent to an amount appropriate to the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anally, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees in front of her and told her that he was "a good boy" at "99%", and that he had been betrayed by that "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims she addressed the police and that the photos of her wounds were taken at the hospital, but later accepted a settlement outside the courtroom because she was “terrified of the possibility of revenge” and worried that “she would be publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that deal as she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack of which he was accused, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would regret' loss of automakers
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He said it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis brands are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they feared leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the Oxford plant where the Mini is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the principle of “fixed on time”: for custom-made cars, parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which industrial manufacturers say could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more of the inventory for a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company says, so production would be stopped.
Clark said May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border delays.”
“There has to be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“Evidence from not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, shows that we need to be able to continue to use what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have to be stopped, but warned that higher prices could reduce the plant’s long-term competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: “Experience has taught me that after they disappear, these jobs don’t come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Trump’s high-level meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the election, links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors of Trump firing the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, have been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate legal panel hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which again delayed the Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It hasn’t been set a date yet. It can be this week or it can be postponed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders did not hold a press briefing at the White House on September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy towards TV reporters, who like to show off, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to show off."
He then suggested that there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president participates in more question and answer sessions than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "We have analyzed the figures."
“There will be more briefings,” Sanders said, “but I think it’s much better for the press to have the opportunity to address the questions directly to the president of the United States, not to me.
We’re trying to do this most of the time and you’ve been able to notice that we’ve done this many times over the past few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace press briefings when it’s available.”
Trump usually answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visiting him.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, making an impromptu, sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
A Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health addresses, in a letter, EU employees from Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) on Brexit fears
The Secretary of State has written to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express gratitude on behalf of the country and the desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter as it was less than six months before the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to bear the costs for applications to receive permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, awaiting decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no deal to leave the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday in the match his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee’s Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the strike took place shortly before the break.
“He got to the cough line and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on the oxygen mask by the physical preparers and medical staff on the cough line before being placed on a stretcher and transported off the field for a thorough assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/amplitude of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a year 2 student, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five tackles in total before leaving the match, reaching a total of 18 tackles throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp court fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp court fee when buying a property in the UK, with the extra money to be used to help homeless people, according to new Conservative Party plans.
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with the right to vote.
Stamp court fee will be applied to persons who are not taxpayers in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp court fee when buying a property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May is due to announce today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher stamp court fee will be applied to individuals and legal entities who are not taxpayers in the UK, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the government’s efforts to help the homeless.
The surcharge, which adds to the current judicial stamp duty, including the high levels two years ago for second property and properties purchased for lease, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring an extra up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which leads to higher prices and puts those who want to buy their first home in difficulty.
Several prosperous areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp court fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high as a result of buying land but not using it, and called on May to drop taxes on affordable homes in order to solve Britain’s “house problem.”
Corbyn has announced a number of proposals for attractive real estate reforms, including rent controls and an end to unmotivated evictions.
It also wants to give councils greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my term as prime minister to fulfilling the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the problems that exist in the real estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair for people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies with offices abroad, to be able to buy homes as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become too far away, and living in unworthy conditions is far too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to be the manager of Scotland’s national team”
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that his "ultimate goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of "resuscitating" the northeastern club, which is currently in third place in the Premier League, with a three-point difference from first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after St. Mirren's return to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We’ve reached the national team B and that’s about it,” Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland’s games at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only get this opportunity if I succeed as the club’s manager.”
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he was not thrilled to be the successor to such established names and to such an important club, after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The only thing that concerns me and could affect my success is the question, ‘Can I help this team get back into the Premier League?’
There is no doubt that the existing structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get her there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel successful is to help bring the club back to the Premier League.”
Ross has only three years of management experience, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months as a member of the training staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover after relegating to the C division and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship the following season.
Ross said he feels better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a decisive moment,” he said of taking over the management of Alloa.
“I really thought that my role as manager was better than my role as a player.
Maybe it sounds strange, because we had a good time, we were winning well and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager, in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel it’s the right role for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do that, I feel like it’s the best thing for me in my entire adult life.”

The ideal time to drink a pint of beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a survey.
This summer’s heatwave has led to increased revenues in UK pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to the figures, pubs and bars saw a 2.7% increase in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the CGA’s representative who provides business consulting services and who conducted the survey, said: “England’s steady warmth and participation in the World Cup over a longer period than expected contributed to a pattern in July, similar to that of the previous month, when pubs recorded up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a higher percentage of customers.
The number of customers down 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June fell further in July.
Pubs and bars that serve only drinks recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
Pubs serving food also experienced heat losses, but not as high as those in restaurants.
Apparently, people went out of town just to drink.
“Beverage sales at all bars and pubs increased by 6.6 percent this month, and food declined by 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, RSM’s representative who provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large-scale sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to experience losses, although the 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales will add to current cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food industry operators, and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the reduced number of newly launched locations.
The company that monitors the sales of UK pubs, bars and restaurants, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret account on a social network that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children, some as young as 11, have a secret account on a social network that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta” accounts.
The news has heightened fears about posts with sexual content
20% of students said they have a “main” account that they show to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create an account on a social network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in “fake Insta” accounts, referring to Instagram’s photo-sharing platform.
The news has heightened fears about posts with sexual content.
20% of students said they have a “main” and “clean” account that they show their parents, but they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, noticed the post of a teenager asking to be “raped.”
According to research by the UK’s Digital Awareness company and the HMC (Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference) of independent schools, 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, and half of them have admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don’t have access to.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘voice of athletes’ in the Scottish Athletes’ Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the non-executive directorship of the Scottish Athletes' Commission at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated field and track athlete, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for decision makers to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the athlete community in Scotland, the UK, as well as around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with its inclusion in the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am delighted that I will be able to represent the athletes and I hope to make a real contribution and help the way sports are conducted in Scotland."
The American athlete, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games in addition to the four gold medals she won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator on the BBC, has remained invalid after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will decide if I will recover or to what extent.
It was titanic work, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
An advertisement for breast pumps comparing women to cows divides public opinion online
A breast pump company has caused public opinion to divide online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that aims to be “the world’s first silent and portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ironic ad, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom the new pump offers breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay barn full of cows on a song that includes such lyrics as, “Yes, I milk, but I don’t have a tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, these are not sores, but my breasts.”
The refrain continues: "I pump, pump, breastfeed the baby, pump, pump, extract the milk from the girls."
However, the advertisement, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has been the target of mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it reveals the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen only a few days after birth," one person wrote.

Another commented: “It’s understandable how traumatic it is for both the mother and the child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added: "Extremely inappropriate advertisement."
Others defended the ad, with one claiming it appeared to him to be a “hilarious” advertisement.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping really made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit inappropriate, but I took it for granted.
But the product is brilliant,” one person wrote.
Another person commented, “It’s a funny ad that targets moms who use the pump (often at work or in the toilets) and who feel like ‘cows.’
It’s not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with discreet pumps inserted into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use breast pumps say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their children in their arms, and even to go out into town while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and design developer at Mother commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what it means to use a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has hit the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Hiddenly Transferred to Refugee Camp on Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has risen, although the number of people crossing the border each month has remained relatively the same, in large part because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves and fear that they will endanger their stay in the country if they request to take back children.
The risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data will be disclosed to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Approximately 80% of people who are sponsors or members of the sponsors’ family live illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of processing children in the system, authorities introduced new rules, according to which children must appear in court one month after detention, and not 60 days as the previous standard provided, according to shelter employees.
Many will plead the case through a video call, and not personally before an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more they can become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or attempts to escape, according to shelter employees and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are accentuated at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating a child has problems are not noticed because of the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to the refugee camp without providing them with enough time for emotional training or to say goodbye to friends could cause trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite Syria being at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also acting prime minister, said foreign military forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "the situation will be properly managed".
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he said at the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred fight until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.”
There are about 2,000 U.S. military troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Arabs in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
Also, in the war-torn country there are more than 1,000 French military troops.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said there were favourable conditions for their return and accused "a few Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears", which led the refugees to keep their distance.
He added: “We have asked for the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return.”
“Political influences are being brought into a problem that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to drive out the last group of rebels has created an opportunity for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal helped avoid a large-scale assault with the help of Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the al-Qaeda network and which "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy, hopes to meet soon in a first meeting of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the committee's activities should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning about interference.
Why Trump will win his second term
If we follow this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless the impeachment procedure or scandals end his term as president earlier, which much of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In that case it would be, without a doubt, “the most dramatic end to a president’s term of office ever!”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time audiences have doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled on MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the first-time, Fox News is watched, on average, by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was watched by 1.7 million, and the "Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people who followed it in the evenings in which important news was broadcast.
“This is a subject that appeals to the public because we can’t understand it,” said Neal Baer, the producer of ABC’s drama “President of the Reserve,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
In the chaos, entertainment is exploited.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be integrated, and the state of the global economy.
Changing jobs is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you are not just an informed citizen when you reach the sixth hour of viewing the debate by an expert committee of how Bob Woodward uses “deep background” and “confidential” sources for his book, “Fear,” about the Washington ostrich leather jacket worth $15,000 by Paul Manafort.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
“A lot of what he does makes you feel like you’re watching a reality show and he feeds you topics every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of the media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show “Pawn Aces,” about the constantly changing cast and the daily upheavals Kim has brought on by Trump.
Don’t allow yourself to miss an episode, because you’ll feel like you’re lagging behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his home on the northern shore of Kauai, it was 27 degrees outside and it was sunny, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording on CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, especially as Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Judiciary Committee and decided the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember doing some unusual shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it looks like they were right.”

Overwhelming external financial resources for the tightest interim elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of the electoral districts, which resulted in two mandate holders running for the same office, it is not at all surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th electoral district enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of the Pittsburgh district brought in the race the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th electoral district, which significantly overlaps with the 17th.
The election maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional, manipulating district boundaries in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th electoral district triggered a competition in campaign funding between major party funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special, top-rated election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th constituency.
For more than a decade, the office had been held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in that district by a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, Democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador because of its deal with China, but then renounced it.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization’s leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to call in U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But they were taken in considered sanctions only against the state of El Salvador, which received US aid worth about $140 million in 2017, including for narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rate of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings made progress, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, administration officials had made it clear they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, wishing to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three U.S. ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they remain anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst, who is a close associate of the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Study of History
The next thing that could happen is Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
Mueller also appears to be steering his investigation into the existence of a plot between Trump’s campaign and Russia over the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face due accountability within the body, even as he prepares to appear before voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There are many possible situations and I don’t want to suggest that a “fall” of Trump is inevitable, which also applies to his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make and that will decide the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler only if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a few such critical moments right now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this newspaper that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated on his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if he is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump to account?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Player Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match against the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season to a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We started the match thinking we would get a good result and we won a point.
Probably we could have scored at the end, but overall, I think the tie was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we were better in the second.
Thursday will once again be an important night for Europe.
With a little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last match played. However, with the support of the fans, we will surely feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, given my injuries and the changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is fine and the guys really like to be here; the training is going well, too.
Let’s hope that we persevere, that we leave behind what happened in the last season and that we will have good results.”
Women have insomnia due to retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
Approximately half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t initiate this conversation,” Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company, said in a statement.
Here's how you can get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide the care you need if you don’t make your wishes known in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be of real help in terms of paying these expenses.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses, or you can insure your own well-being – to the extent that you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: come and face legal issues.
Obtain a medical decision-making empowerment to appoint a trusted person to oversee your healthcare and ensure that healthcare professionals respect your wishes if you can’t communicate them.
Also consider performing an empowerment on your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you don’t have the capacity to do so.
Don’t forget the little details: imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are?” Martin asked.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of his dog?
Write a plan for all of these things.”
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe

The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2:30 a.m., as "random shootings".
The victim was unable to see the attacker.
His injuries did not put his life in danger, and police called on witnesses to testify.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia's Palu on Friday, according to authorities, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area in northern Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating 40 years of existence when it was hit by the tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that stretches on a coast with an area of more than 300 km in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative region that lies at the bottom of a province, has a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fish farming and agriculture are the central economic activity of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Mining activities for nickel mining are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Donggala Regency, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Circle of Fire, an area of intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
On December 26, 2004, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of the island of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the deaths of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of the island of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006 – A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the south of Indonesia’s most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in Aceh’s Pidie Jaya Regency, causing damage and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami that resulted in a large number of deaths.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died from the collapsed buildings.
2018: Several powerful earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, causing the deaths of more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded under the rubble.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and in opposition to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska state police.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is in police custody at the Mat-Su unit awaiting trial, and is being held on a $500 bond without bail, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself “100% innocent” when he was asked to plead, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A felony charges, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with such a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, engaging in a domestic violence crime claim and possessing a gun while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend, he punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress disorder he suffers from after serving in the Iraqi military.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck off the coast of the central province of Sulawesi, which lies in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The federal prosecutor wants the death penalty for the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been enforced in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on its trajectory in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally killed” the eight victims and “intentionally inflicted” serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent on the request for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both indictments can receive a death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in support of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the act as “odious, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, suffering and losses to the families and friends of the following persons: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he was happy with what he had done, according to police.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police, he also asked to fly the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the ex officio defenders who represented Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to enforce the death penalty, instead of accepting a life imprisonment plea with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's team of defenders previously asked the prosecutor not to apply the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the civilian army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians need to “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of May’s parliament that suggested he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a Conservative MP, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the UK would have “come out” by now if Farage had been secretary for the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge May faces with regard to the highly divided camps has been accentuated by members of the Conservative Party who have joined another protest against the European Union exit organized in the city.
The prime minister is trying hard for his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, to run properly, facing attacks from those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to stay in it, as well as from the European Union.
The allies stressed that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the Eurosceptic and Labour Party to choose between its offer and “chaos”.
Bone said at the “Leave Means Leave” pro-Brexit event in Solihull that he wants to “give up the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with negotiations with Brussels.
“If things were run by him, we were no longer in the European Union,” he said.
The Conservative MP, the Wellingborough constituency representative, added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be slavish.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied suggestions of changing public opinion in the 2016 vote: “It’s not true at all that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
“The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it, nor do our activists who go out into the streets and support us, first and foremost, in the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message targeting Theresa May, she added: “The prime ministers who keep their job are the ones who keep their promises.”
At the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians must be put in a position to “feel the pressure” if they are about to give up the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we’re not going to let them do this.’
He added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the civilian army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of remaining in the European Union marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that read “The Conservative Party is against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at Conservative Party members and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can deploy IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the digitization of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It is a farce.
Brexit does not bring benefits,” he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democratic senator spoke on Saturday about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November's election against Geoff Diehl, a Republican House member who served as co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of citizens with the right to vote using the mayoral format since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come for "women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our severely affected government and this includes having a woman at its head."
A suspect has been arrested in the case of the death that caused the death of the Sims player from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the death that caused the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted video footage of Friday’s shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the images.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, that he was in possession of a weapon, and that he shot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior 1.98m tall player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the original batch last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that orders given by the Mercedes team would play a key role in the race.
Setting first in the standings, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop boxing and leave Hamilton behind in the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the boxing lap one later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after a few schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inside free, after making a double move to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race on the back row of the grid and was in seventh place near the end of the first lap, on the very day he turned 21.
Then he was in the lead for much of the race, aiming for a quick ending and trying to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
Eventually, he stopped at the boxing lap at number 44, but could not increase the pace in the last eight laps, with Raikkonen remaining fourth.
Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me come forward.
And the team has done an excellent job to achieve victory over Ferrari and to achieve this double,” Hamilton said.
Terrible body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not facilitate the “leakage” of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown people to be "bad, immoral and lying."
“The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and lying,” he said.
“When you see that they published and leaked information and then say they didn’t.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When did Dianne Feinstein ask her if she made it easier to “leak” the document?
Do you remember her answer? She said, um... what?
Aaa...no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "leaked" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "leak" occurred from her office.
“I have not concealed the allegations against Ford and I am not the one who facilitated the ‘leakage’ of her account,” Feinstein told the committee, according to the Hill newspaper.
“He asked me to keep my privacy, and that’s exactly what I did.”
But her denial doesn’t seem to have hurt the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “To be honest, it was terrible body language.
“Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Notice the wickedness, the immorality, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to destroy in order to gain power and control,” the president said, according to the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee's Stars team wins 5-3 against Belfast's Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee's Stars team paid for Friday's Elite League loss, winning against Belfast's Giants in Saturday's return match with a 5-3 score in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead, with the shots being taken by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back in front of the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard tied the score for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat this season for Adam Keefe's players, who had regained ground by defeating the Dundee team 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening show was triggered in the fourth minute, or 3:35, by a pass from Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a game that started so dynamically, Sullivan brought the host team back into the game in the 13:10 minute, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the opportunity to score for a tie in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the lead of the Giants before the first break, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first half.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard tied again with an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus ensuring the team climbed to 5th place in the standings in the middle of the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died after securing the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is considered a hero, dying after securing the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong aftershocks in the area and many people are trapped under the remains of Palu.
Although his colleagues had fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Palu’s heavily shaking Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
It remained on the scene to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air-control tower when he noticed that he was about to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s air navigation service provider said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter has to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are saddened by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency saying access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“We believe the number will increase as many victims are still in ruins and we have not had access to many of them,” said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters high devastated the city of Palu, with a joint funeral due to be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings casualties.
It is almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the minimarkets are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to provide help to survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to carry out all the evacuation operations.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says one person is missing after plane crashes in lagoon in Micronesia
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one person is missing, after previously saying all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger had been missing since Saturday afternoon.
She also said she was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional passenger details, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and U.S. Naval Forces said the plane missed the runway and landed in a nearby lagoon.
Some witnesses believe the plane crossed the end of the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very short distance from the ground.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the waist, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Naval Forces said sailors working nearby to renovate a landing gear jumped in, using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank 30 meters underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered in the PNG in the last two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini plane.
Analyst presents chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s office closed its plea in resuming trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the cell phone footage to put together the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and his victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting her earlier claims, according to Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his boyfriend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was summoned to the witness stand and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A trio that plays hip-hop music wants to change the negative way this kind of music is seen, with the help of songs with positive messages.
Bristol-based band The High Breed claims that hip-hop has stopped conveying political messages and addressing social issues, as it originally did.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop consciously popular again.
A recent revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common has been observed in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another person of color?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after she received a “racist” text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal on discriminatory grounds after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was “still a black person.”
The couple denied that they were racist, saying she sued them for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first day of work in 2016.
“NUUUUUUUU! ANOTHER PERSON OF COLOR,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the blunder, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, had not performed her duties properly and had expected to receive a nanny of Filipino nationality, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day’s work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple for compensation for her firing and demands $350 a day for six months, the period she was supposed to live and work with them, despite the fact that this was done without a contract concluded.
“I want to show them that they don’t do such things,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denied allegations that they were racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent him the wrong message.
He is not a racist person.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco, her husband, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve wronged, even if by mistake?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Considering the trial an "extortion" action, Plasco said his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person in such circumstances?
This is not the case,” the banker added.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for their behavior and logic.
The editors of Paddington's story feared readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it gets published.
It’s very funny now, after seeing Paddington have had a huge success.”
She said her father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a teddy bear to write the children's book, was optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books was a "sweet-yellow" after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success she later enjoyed.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a kid who had a success: you’re proud of him, though it’s not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always gave Paddington credit.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad frequently called to tell me that he was very serious and that he didn’t think he would survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications given by doctors for her heart to continue pumping blood began to diminish and exit her body.
It had died a short time ago and the organs were starting to stop working.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was going on.
I couldn’t yell or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself.”
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the death of his daughter, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I kept my head down and the tears didn’t stop flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I knew I needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two mourning women place messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and include phone numbers that people can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone appreciated his smile.
They always said that his smile changed your mood."
However, he quit work before dying because he had arrived at a very unfortunate time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his life.
Davis said, “I keep thinking it’s going to have a domino effect.”
It created the messages “to tell people that they can call someone or talk to someone, even a friend.
Get out, you need to talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, Davies’ longtime friend, lost her 15-year-old life partner Mark shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or that he was depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day when the kids unpacked their presents and he didn’t even look them in the eye.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but she must overcome it: “It caused immense pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as a result of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation.
“I thought if we could get something similar to what he was asking for — a limited-time, small-scale investigation — we might have a little bit of unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was about to “disintegrate” amid a partisan blockade.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks to go before the Nov. 6 election — if, as expected, Republicans perform poorly, their attempts to place the one they want as the winner in the election for the country’s highest court will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush has been appealing to senators to persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make a difference in the event of a tie and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of fugitives drops under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said about 1,127 people fled the country last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by those smuggling people across the border.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
A vast majority of North Korean fugitives are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two sides of Korea.
China considers fugitives to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for several talks on denuclearization talks.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate on a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. sanctions of causing no progress since.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security, and in such situations we won’t be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical," declaring he is unable to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court as "hysterical" and said his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations of sexually harassing Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and losing his voice because of emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "a grotesque and coordinated assassination of character" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and how he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi drifted off topic when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I just want to say this: if he’s not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it’s not just right for the Supreme Court, it’s not right for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District of Columbia Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Accessible Care Act or the Roe versus Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Oh, how wonderful!’” Pelosi said.
Women also need to be able to handle it.
It is a justified diatribe, there are months and years of accumulated anger and he cannot speak without bursting into tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, is it?”
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman in an executive position who told me that she was also crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique whereby, when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
I thought it was a brilliant thing.”
Tears are allowed for the exteriorization of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I started crying because of an inexpressible anger, is that I was grabbed by the neck by an older woman, a cold director I always felt a little afraid of, and she took me down the staircase.
“They should never see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
I think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they made you feel that way.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressional Democrat in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought she had no reason not to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well thought-out decision,” she says, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As the campaign was coming to an end, she was behind on the fundraiser and swore she would not enter the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000, they were only giving her $250.
“Do they think I’m getting cuts?” she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by emotions – as a result of gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – that she lost her voice.
“You would have said I was having a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls of the media’s reactions to her.
“You would have said that one of my sponsors is Kleenex.”
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my gravestone.

How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial for Beijing?
The salves that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China have been deafening, and while there seems to be a long way to go before it ends, the disputes between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods in China that reach the United States.
Beijing has taken revenge each time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has warned it will respond to every blow from the United States, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly giving in to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. pressures on the trade war could support China positively in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than previously anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of experts.
Syria ready for return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country ravaged by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things can return to normal.
The existing conditions allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded its sixth consecutive defeat in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who put incredible effort into much of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial shot into the water to hair 3 from hole 16, giving up the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all rounds, becoming one of only four players with a 5-0-0 result since the current format of the tournament existed in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost in holes 5 and 4 to the last-placed player in the European team standings, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World No. 1 player Dustin Johnson lost in holes 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, probably his last Ryder Cup match.
A Ryder Cup veteran who has participated in eight editions, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the player in Europe with the most victories, averaging 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I’m not used to crying, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m very happy that I won the cup again.
It’s teamwork and I’m glad we could be of help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He handed over the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1 in the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I used to watch his games as a kid,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Throughout the weekend, the American team made a real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinarily throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: “I’m proud of them, they really did their best.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a heated fight.
Take your hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be their captain.
We must give them due respect.
They played better than us."
