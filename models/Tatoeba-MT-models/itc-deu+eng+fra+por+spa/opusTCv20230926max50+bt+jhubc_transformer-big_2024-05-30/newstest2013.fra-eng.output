A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama's Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers it a myth, claiming that election fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws starting in 2009 that make the process of registration or voting more difficult.
This phenomenon grew after the November 2010 elections, which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce pre-voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and remove citizens with a judicial record from their right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo IDs.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo IDs issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity document.
However, it often costs more than $100 to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
A lot more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their identity card with photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
Two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers sponsored laws that abolished voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have enacted laws in five other states aimed at shortening the pre-voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter accounted for only 13% of the state’s voters.
It was the same with the Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites who made up 76% of voters made up only 46% of voters voting ahead of time.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes from Democratic governors.
The U.S. attorney general intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws accounted for 171 of the 270 votes needed by the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This makes men who are already reluctant to take screening tests even more hesitant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who did not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that you are between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if you are not screened.
So I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at higher risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, and opting instead, in these cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are being precisely determined.
I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, the adoption of good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from them.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved around enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one else smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is very damaging to people’s health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular physical activity over a lifetime protects against colon cancer.”
The food
The organization also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Charcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," it is explained.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one saw a decrease in prostate cancer risk, another saw an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unclear.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
“Passing a screening test doesn’t give cancer.”
The Higgs Boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but data is still lacking to be perfectly certain.
Suppose, however, that it is the Higgs, since the chances of making a mistake seem slim, and let's see what it is.
There is, in this world, a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you'll hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly consisting of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they may indeed be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would be in some way related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field at this precise place, a bit like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, that must be "disturbed" for that boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, one must reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond of which only a very large rock could wrinkle the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN's - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful in explaining the relationship between Higgs and mass.
Not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never stand on its own on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, tiens) do not.
Now, what does all this research "can bring," Ms. Plamondon asks?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancy between the observations and predictions of the MS.
There are also many who are eager to find one, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plug some holes of the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, proposing no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-ops!).
But such gaps have not been found at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of this research in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. All-World are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers at Bell Laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work was about to unleash.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle – who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed), in 1962 – at first the laser was rather seen as a “lab gadget”.
Imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although not at all its original intention, now serves as an “eye” to all the digital cameras in the world, and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009.
This of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it does mean that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... <0x7C> The Duty
With its Dying with Dignity Commission, Quebec has recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
In this essential area, however, much remains to be done.
Duty tried to take a closer look at it.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him had left him a two-year break.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," he says, half-fig half-grape, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for that,” he says.
The disease does its job: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, talks to strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pisses standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Going back to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept regression, he notes.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life prognosis of three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and suffocated".
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I have no desires in life,” she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
In the coming days, however, she awaits a final visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, we provide body care and food assistance.
These are palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little when we know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether in terms of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person will agree to provide mouth care with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, a beer was served to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help loved ones as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but are not the same.
Alongside a 93-year-old man savoring his last family gathering in the yard, tightly stuck in his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," said Dr Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Société de soins palliatifs à domicile du Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that causes several physicians specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care leaders including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not performing well enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before they agree to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients are asking to die only because they are not receiving the right care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are hard at work on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard’s life expectancy was already minimal when she dropped out of strenuous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
Yet she told me I was finished!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not complying with their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Société de soins palliatifs à domicile du Grand Montréal, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is equivalent to sleeping the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me”, it means “I want to be relieved”.
This report was made possible by a Journalism Fellowship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, fundraisers from political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell each day what they know about a formidable “system”, mixing building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers very dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been crumbling since we took the big money," said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal erupted in 2011, through a substantive investigation into embezzlements related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had consented only backwards.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the Ministry of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," he said, "some holding back their instincts to get a share!
The Charbonneau Commission “has already knocked down two mayors,” he adds, hoping it will succeed in “demonstrating the schemes behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also works with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More the police of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, would have led the "sewer cartel" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swellings of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of pocketing bribes repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused engineers on the roads of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years, he paid 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked broker who donated the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed in the 2000s, donating more than C$88,000 (about $68,000) to provincial parties, especially the then-incumbent Liberals.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts he was inflating the costs of
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked well.
Gilles Surprising, a former public works engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other officials of the road confessed to having their paw greased by inflating from 30% to 40% the invoices, by false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first women elected in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she revolted in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says that she "draws on a thread to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the culprits".
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
The wound is being cleaned, but it would take a Montreal-specific unit of investigation and a watch, so that the questionable practices do not return.
It's like cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elects aware of the ploy", when they were not diving into the trickery!
Estimating at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to 100 dollars, but that will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete revision of the system of granting public contracts and party financing: "We can not go further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look into their own courtyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I progress alongside them.
The technical staff also helped me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't get aroused.
From my debut at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recruits of this summer are used to playing games of very high level.
They also know that every workout is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Sure, of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with upscale clubs.
He has played with great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting conversation with him.
I came out of a series of injuries.
His confidence in me also explains my performance.
What are your thoughts on PSG’s first season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th of finals with the way.
What is the club’s goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in front of very good European teams.
We first want to finish first of our group, in front of Porto, to be able to receive in the 8th round return.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and sign up in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this title.
Last season, we didn't get far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We've had a really big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, has made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it’s the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us given what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to reproach us, it's sure to be a bit frustrating.
I wonder what people are expecting more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game plan.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer present.
Look at Manchester City who have not been able to qualify for the finals in two seasons, they have also made huge expenses!
Regarding the sums invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we can have a smile telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's better if we say there's a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and sets a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today, I manage to make good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my christening with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and today we must behave in an exemplary manner.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of Les Bleus?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) snatched, on October 16, in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, Pay and Sell Without Banks
Just the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer to peer.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a high of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
Yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “in competition with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to progress in a video game that you earn by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this type of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and processes the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both account book depositories, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually done between two email addresses in the manner of an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through solving a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and whose winner, sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a phase of file hashing, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular imprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, for fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves some margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also increased with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen.
“The flaw used is not about the protocol itself,” said Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, “giant balances” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which come back cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of questioning of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to come through, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in case of success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting everything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban raid on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood, because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had then been perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved these days.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are joining in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They moved into businessmen, seizing government land to sell it to build land to refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They disregarded themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have come to know the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with the reconstitution of provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and before.
No industry has been restarted, no dam is in place, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
It has been rumoured that Afghanistan possesses immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s largest employers.
It will also take some time for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: high school for girls and boys, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of making aids and offensive actions coincide, a "civil-military actions" service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, has carried out, and has been carried out by a small French NGO, numerous collective interest work and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of villages.
This work, greedy of local labor, was able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of cultivable areas.
What will we leave as a memory, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of the very harsh local living conditions in these valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa Province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which the farmers told me they wanted, a small, well-controlled and directly affecting civilian aid would have to be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration, which grants it provisionally full powers, it has decided to play its part.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave this House two additional months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text for almost two years, several times amended, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his “autocratic delirium”, continuing to “betray his word” and “trompe the law”.
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that obliges the Brothers to renounce their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as protest rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote in favour, as he claimed in an interview with the US weekly Time.
Especially since this use of a hasty vote stems from the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers", these supposedly to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked on the door, believing that they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, the articles were most often unanimously voted on.
Commentators were also amused by the fact that one of the only divergences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, with some members of the committee believing that the constituent's pendulum was poorly settled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, has 234 articles.
Objects of all attention, article 2 remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," respond the Liberals, who see it only as a blow to communication.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include Article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see in it the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are further fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system," tempers Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be an ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question may arise in the future as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to rule on it.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are markedly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights groups.
The latter also expressed their concerns about the text, which they considered to be liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, there is no longer any article that echoes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her view, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak last night on television, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has identified five great reasons to visit Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
You must visit: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever enters these “baptismal funds” will be touched by divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm or where the fishing was miraculous.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk along the Street of Suffering or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the Antonia fortress (the praetorium), where the trial was held, then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Anointing and the burial.
This is where the Christian center of the world stands, a symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place of the Jews: the Lamentation Wall which constitutes the remainder of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, a former refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins lie on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there on their own.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
The old beliefs say that pagan gods once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
Impossible to visit them all in a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First: the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (the parliament).
It houses the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
There are mainly paintings by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of casts of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures by Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars are shining.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel’s three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not drop below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure-coloured water contains brine and very easily retains swimmers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
We come to perform a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old city of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in the narrow streets that are named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who have come to take photoshoots from all over Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "conquer" the fortress of the crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, notably Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you are going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only subway line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The trip in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, scale-free fish and dishes composed of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish pasta, different sauces, ground chickpea balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk the air haughty.
We can see them sleeping at night on the roofs of parked cars.
These cats love passing places and do not refuse to be enjoyed.
Renting a car varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 per day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Entrance to the museum costs on average 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who has language, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
As MPs and human rights activists controversy over what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling “false” certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has come into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
For the time being, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
You will need to validate your language skills in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained educational certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what is it going to give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, say the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery at work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to cross paths with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "journey" in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of his fellows will torment themselves for months without food and papers and will have to work between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“In their homes, they are promised something, and when they arrive, they are cheated, they are taken their passport, and they do not get their salary,” said Tolib Charipov, head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of Tajikistan’s migration service.
Don't argue with me, Officer!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to come and make money in Russia are confident that they not only do not know the language of the country they wish to go to, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to attend even a reasonable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children, let alone to dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity presents itself.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they say.
“You feel diminished and diminished.”
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will be aimed only at migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no examination or official work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or Defend to Enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and always the language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, one can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They are asking us for 100, 200 rubles, to buy cigarettes, tea," Umed Khushkadamov, a Tajik national, told reporters.
“Be quick, don’t sluggish, and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language exam certificates have already been confiscated by Federal Migration Service employees.
Forged papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not consider them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Power representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “paper towels.”
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to pass the exam at the first stroke time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against the bearers of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether shootings at weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow jurist Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullet weapons in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining the license to carry weapons by increasing it from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Law would be introduced in the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Internet in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were registered over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that strengthening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market for arms is supplied via several channels.
There are five main channels, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking control of weapons
The first is "the military trace", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of black market weapons are those stolen from law enforcement by criminals.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stockpiles and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal guns go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of them have often suffered explosions.
"Tested versions indicate that some fires were set on purpose to cover up the deficit," he said.
For Baranets, the arms manufacturers are there for something.
“We see private arms factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow,” said one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Studies.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "due to employees whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "clandestine excavations".
A salesman and consultant at an armory who asked to remain anonymous assures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these specialists of the clandestine excavation; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will pick up the new goods from military warehouses.
The person purchases a unit through a sign, for example a TT pistol.
We deliver it to him by passing the merchandise through a wire mesh.
“He transports it to the city and sells it for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>900 per unit with two chargers,” he says.
“It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers,” the seller adds.
"Like in a luxury shop"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I checked sites, blogs, until a guy came up and offered me to come to the Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun was given to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the salesman. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are vendors in the markets, but there you also have to come saying, for example, "From that person, who asked me to report that his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give them to him.
The young ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets attempted to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s as he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "everything we want".
“I thought I was in a luxury store,” recalls the soldier.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, we go with the seller to the forest and set up a target.
“I am allowed to shoot and when I am convinced that the weapon is working well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, you do not need any documents and no one to meet.
"It is enough to have a precise sum of money," the ad reads on the website "Buy a pistol or a combat machine gun".
Users leave their questions and ask questions.
Are we selling to minors?

I have heard of these types of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take over.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"In return, he receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the Right to a Weapon Association.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, we can end up without a gun and behind bars.

Makarov for $100
Buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a gun", one can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It came out of the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official data of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes has overall decreased in Russia by 7% and amounts to 22.9 miles while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs has decreased by 7.8%.
U.S.: Fast-food and supermarket workers on strike
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teens go through a cashier’s job at McDonald’s
In recent days, a wave of protests has mounted against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict if this wave is going to increase in magnitude or slow down quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Along with the rise in modest wages for basic employees at Walmart and in fast food chains, protest organizers are seeking unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at a time when a flood of payrolls that seized millions of inhabitants fell on America and sometimes triggered clashes.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize strike pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the company whose products are aimed at consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart markets everything from diapers to shotguns to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid employees at Walmart shop only in their workplaces.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply because of the low salaries of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanded a salary increase, they complained that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who earns $9.5 an hour, that’s an amount he can’t afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart raised the average hourly wage to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That's 1.1% more than he's currently spending.
If Walmart were to transfer the entire wage increase to the shoulders of consumers, each run in the store would cost them an extra 46 cents.
They will spend $12.39 more in one year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did no harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over that period 5,000 items per second.
Its cashiers have made a total of 100 million transactions for Black Friday.
The company's spokesman Dan Fogleman assured in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that in all "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a "com' operation among many others" on the part of the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were not about Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet established there) but about McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s advertises selling billions of servings and then they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you for the work you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast foods increase them over time, but on average, its basic employees earn $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one touches less than them in this city.
It's inconceivable for me to live with that amount in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald’s after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wished to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live on that salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal there are comments that say that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you are going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters by bullying or firing.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a trade union, seizing fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous protests were taking place near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near Times Square’s McDonald’s with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, “McDonald’s announces selling billions of servings and then they don’t even give you sick leave and pay you for the work you did honestly!”
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including Mayoral Candidate Bill De Blasio who said that “we all need to support fast food employees so they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most significant event the fast food industry has seen in its entire history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not to mention that not all of them were fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is currently difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"At the moment, we can only averagely deceive the brain"
Lately, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with Shahram Izadi, director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to broaden the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained so far to the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes to the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in commanding by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us too?
- Although Kinect has made the interaction physical, a lot of things take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information entry has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for now, not really.
We're trying to change that, and we're working on real 3D imaging systems running on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to bring out the computer world in ours, in the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let’s get rid of those stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
It’s appreciated, but isn’t it overrated?
We cannot say that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of our actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the camera, but by a bracelet worn in the hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this can?
You would do it with words and with gestures.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or can not do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we are based in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but rather the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche of our Redmond lab gave the touch of the sensors a steady processing delay of between 1 and 100 <0xCE><0xBC>s, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a camera of this type in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames per second.
Shouldn’t we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual visible field sensor.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a soft product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how it could help define the locations.
"As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone with hands up is not practical but here is what I think: the best option would be a "transient" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch glasses to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes them strong (the personal items are the ones you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing.
What responses is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
At the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image support.
It records the pressure perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really meant to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work presenting perspectives.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
Making him believe that he feels what he normally should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
There is still one task below which it will take a long time to go: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we work on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we only manage to deceive the brain on average, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "L'avant-garde pétersbourgeoise" dedicated to city dwellers who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city’s border and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all red dressed that you can meet near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in parties and trendy vernissages.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always bring crowds together, regardless of where they are exhibited.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
Recently he took in his hands a Barbary organ and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role due to his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you walk around the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a couturier specialized in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were located.
I knew that was my way.
Then, the wave of the old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I began to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevshchina who gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to find myself in the center of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took my place in Pushkinskaya-10, which was home to a music and art club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian Petersburg.
Many were born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour coming with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnur and his friends sang easy playback songs in tight jerseys, including Igor Vdovin, a composer now in fashion.
When the band began performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg hosted a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was at home that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I am a hero of the last century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named Painter of the Year, and that's when my reign came to an end.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a topicality and a very strong acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it’s scary to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything disappears, the tragic falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we'd rather spit in his face.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
Recently we saw you as the organ player of Barbary. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who but me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be neat, delicate, liquorous.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into flocks, supporters of bohemianism loved one thing, fools loved another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I’m not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you’re going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and at the end of the day it is less management, less money, everything perishes.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to cheat them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones we paint at the end of life.
Nowadays, ideas are often confused.
They say: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
During the reign of the good tsars, it was not like this, the tsars did not understand the culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they're being sidelined, because it takes higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and make their way.
Currently, it is the "kingdom of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time pushing.
We need cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that’s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Scholarship
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with Earthlings on board set off in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how to continue to make our species live in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"It's about Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live there at very high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from the terrestrial varieties.
Then we put insects into orbit, small breeding Drosophila flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how a weightless embryo developed.
We get at the exit a chick quite normal.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chick has to find a support, it has to get on its legs and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
Finding no support, the chicks agitated in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We opened their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological “miniature ark” with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. You have to do this kind of research," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to reproduce directly in space.
It's no small matter.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans are capable of this in principle.
Homo sapiens possess abstract thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has of most precious.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would stand after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the theft.
“No one was answering that question,” said Vakhtang Vachnadze, a retired rocket and space scientist.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a baby girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being in orbit twice and even working in extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbital flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train on extra-vehicular trips.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but nevertheless a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibious humans seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Since the baby evolves about 9 months into the lymphatic fluid in her mother's belly, it is easier for her to get used to the water afterwards.
This is in principle logical, because from its birth until its first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the newborn child the weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the thrust capacity of the baby is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on birth simulators.
We can of course prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will manage to get it out.
"What then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite us to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the organism does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
You can’t dress an infant like an adult with a special wetsuit for training.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would envisage in this case imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, totally misfit," predicts the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become a reality, as Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their space-born offspring.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institution for the Control of Public Finances) said: "The control of pseudo-self-employment (Czech " <0xC5><0xA0>varc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but is lagging behind in its implementation.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Institution for the Control of Public Finances, said in an interview for Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," Kala said in her commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' approach to the " <0xC5><0xA0>varc system " .
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG will not bother contractors with controls; is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority in charge of going to inspect and demanding compliance with the law," Kala said.
At the meeting of the oversight committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German draft in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation and a practice proper follow it.
We have put all this together, and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "stronger and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to continually develop increasingly detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote oneself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project really help you and what does it mean for you?
A common control of this kind should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering market thresholds will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork that those who look for loopholes will find far more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar institution to our CSI or a different mode of organization?
As far as institutions are concerned, like the ISC, the similarly organized Bundesrechnungshof operates there, it also has a somewhat differently constituted council, but these two institutions proceed fundamentally in a similar way.
The competences are also, to some extent, similar, but with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it also has accounts of this type at the level of the different Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed in our country by the regions and the municipalities, are there controlled at the level of the accounts of the Länder.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model but one can certainly not say that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we see as a model also faces a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, right?
As regards national legislation, what has the amendment to the Public Procurement Act meant for you as an institution, are its effects already being felt?
As this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out ex-post checks, we have to count on a certain delay.
Our comments concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing future checks - we have launched a new "mismanagement risk detection" instrument with which we have screened almost 14,000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
So do you consider the passage of this law to be more of an advantage or an additional burden on the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) was forcing the audited subjects to accept that any breach of the Market Law would mean a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really helpful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequences on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDG will not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system - what does that mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system banned or allowed?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from acting to inspect and enforce the law.
He may declare, “We will change the law and allow it,” but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing had happened.
The law on contracts contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the invitation to tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are sometimes frozen, but most of them are still viable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowy.
The network, however, remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were practical this morning, but in frozen and snowy places as well.
Temperatures dropped and ranged between -5° and -10°C but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
However, the peaks of the Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né hory are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service indicate that due to the fog, visibility was in some places reduced.
The R6 highway and the national roads in the region are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance remains to be exercised, for example on certain decks whose lining can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-category lanes, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There are still remains of frozen snow and some places crammed by traffic on some of their stretches.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to increase their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Highways and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some East Bohemian roads are threatened by ice formation and that traffic-squeezed layers of snow can be found on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of frost formation in areas of the Pardubice region located at altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, mainly on departmental and third category roads.
Highways I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-squeezed snow is present on roads in high-altitude areas.
In East Bohemia, the day will be very dry, mostly clear, and partly cloudy.
The wind will be weak and the temperatures will generally be between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practicable, although in some places there is a need to be more vigilant and to adapt driving to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillating between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and the subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to pass through foggy areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is apparent from the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
Highway D5 is practically easy to access, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometers 80 and 131.
The lining of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the Pilsen-South district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on less busy roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to areas of the Olomouc region located at altitude must now rely on a layer of thick and soft snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>, after chemical treatment operations.
Snowfall last night forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field; according to road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
In other parts of the region, most roads are easily accessible.
" On the heights of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district there are snow remains.
Drivers heading for Jeseník should expect to encounter at the so-called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" pass a layer of thick, soft snow," the head of road maintenance services in <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also visited the area overnight; they said that after chemical treatment, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district the roads are easy to walk, but in the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk district drivers should be careful in the sections in forested areas with wet roads.
Regions of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, road maintenance services in North Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na <0xC3><0x9A>stecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below freezing at lower altitudes, so snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, particularly southeast of the Bohemian Central Plateau, there is, on the contrary, no problem and roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, especially around <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow melt during the day, clear skies and frost during the night.
Difficult conditions are also reported from the main traffic routes on the national road 13 on the border between the <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec regions.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of the snow until reaching the road.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news stories, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band The Tap Tap, we laugh about it and we think that we are the only group able to collect a remnant of positive energy in order to postpone or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will practically end by the time the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati that lies in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap along with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled "End of the world cancelled" (in Czech " Konec sv<0xC4><0x9B>ta zru<0xC5><0xA1>eno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it also at these charity concerts?
Of course, at the very end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also come together at some point as part of a very unique live show on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák who also plays the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studyo training center which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on in the framework of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, with the association Tap, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to get to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several bands and performers be on stage at each of these concerts?
On what criteria did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other “mega events” of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; there too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the home of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible as it sounds at first glance.
We have five members in an electric armchair whose gear must travel in the hold, of course we also carry a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has more or less always gone well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Through your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that to the east is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very poorly accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association striving to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
How do we still catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common, however, that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and ease of access are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have among us famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let’s go back a few years, what drove you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And as I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we lost a little bit of control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
It’s true, building connections with well-known singers and actively working to promote the band helped us.
We have understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to grants from the European Union, we can, in addition, afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
The show business is full of stuff that copies each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, who we must take pity on.
These are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them but for the whole of society.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think that's completely normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The band The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
The only one, La<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We are an open group, people come in and go out, we can't do anything about it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the predicted day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012, from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the song of the band The Tap Tap "End of the world cancelled" will be sung jointly.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional Studyo training centre in Prague at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is CZK 400, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the Cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member state of the former Eastern Bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the following years participated in a number of ESA projects.
Poland's journey into space, however, began much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always find understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the lecture of A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, in which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
The so-called Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned astronautic propagator, his contribution being rewarded notably by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon.
In 1925 a draisin was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the draisin.
The only information known about this draisine is that of the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the preserved documents that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric rocket, drawn by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were conducted by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all work.
This committee had been created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish aeronautical society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problème, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902–1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Beginning in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed just under 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built and, during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket began in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was halted.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965 succeeded the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed at the Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's entry into the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Utility Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Utility Works Act.
This decision has raised a lively debate in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberal-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the various economic entities and national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and the free (unlimited) movement of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (wages) generate a tension on prices.
The term should be understood as meaning the following: a producer endeavours, by importing goods sold at low prices, to resist economic competition by making the price of the competitor more expensive, with the aim of taking away a greater share of the market and thereby increasing his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either transferring production abroad, buying cheaply, or disappearing. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no liability for the unemployment it generates, the social burdens of the State necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that there is no need to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without regard to social collapse.
This is mainly manifested in the amendments of the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the price dictate of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is due, on the one hand, to a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, to the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In the FRG, there have been for years public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is already counted in millions.
In the context of the increasing competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite commonplace that wage earners receive such wages that the state is forced to pay a surcharge in order for them to reach the vital minimum.
Such a scandal has, for example, been brought up in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of practically all the southern EU Member States undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or to live with wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day they will be forced to invest in private life.
The question must be asked: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are tired of claiming that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the led economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and even, according to its own selfish interests, direct politics and, by the same token, the entire state.
The answer to this question is without a doubt yes.
Proof of this is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby in every state.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the FRG, the situation is such that due to a lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of legislation to firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as Western-style constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State had long been in full decay and functions were attributed by violence.
Bribes, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
Under-the-tables and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold"... ... "Honest people did not seek in any way to obtain functions, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls".... ' It really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was a real pompistic but the 'remedies' was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a man...
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as in the past, is an unprecedented decadence of elites, with no effort to make profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a sort of pause before a new stage.
The fact that today’s elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses of life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today as well as the crimes against humanity as we have known them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Utility Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and internally in Europe, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase citizen influence over government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will,” Sting says in the song titled Fragile, whose main verse in the chorus is “Let’s not forget how fragile we are.”
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be wars,” said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have arisen.
Some side with Israel, arguing for its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurring killings; after all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the Autonomous Territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a view "behind the curtain" on the one who mainly benefit from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (since the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of a struggle for power.
In every epoch, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owed their acts on the throne to someone who directed their acts according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration, which has given rise to certain powers, has not been possible in the course of a single generation.
Among the families possessing an astronomical wealth, the Rothschild family stands out particularly, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude him).
Little is written about them.
Of course you did.
As early as the nineteenth century, they acquired the world’s first news agency (Reuters) in order to stop the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts with which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase of their wealth or both.
They own major holdings in almost most of the world’s central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the central bank under Russian control).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America’s central bank status and began issuing his own money during the civil war (government, I understand) and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to file a lawsuit against the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to abolish colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population by between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing else than an absolute power, and acquiring a final solution to such a problem).
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are untrue and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent the recurrence of crises such as those they provoked in 1907).
After succeeding in triggering the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the central European power.
For an easier start to the Second World War, the bankers let the politicians create a latent conflict situation: they, on the one hand, imposed on Germany far-reaching reparations of war thus generating the conditions of a radicalization of the impoverished masses (they then had to place a sufficiently energetic German leader, showing the fingers of the culprits, proposing simple solutions).
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (back to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held him; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the sufferings of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel ignited a fire that could provoke a Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in starting this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (just see how people are severely divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong engenders another wrong according to a circle of endless violence and where the origin of everything is found, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
Here we must distinguish between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, the international bankers only propose their own candidates to the people in elections.
The current prime minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to that country's membership in the Shanghai cooperative organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc....) expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran's transitor n' miles of oil (China, Russia, Pakistan, etc.)
In 1994, David Rockefeller said, “All we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their view, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
“Let them compel all individuals, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to bear a red iron mark on their hands or foreheads, so that they may not buy or sell anyone who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the numeral of its name.
It must be understood: that the one who has common sense counts the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number designates man, and it is six hundred and sixty-six.”
The movie Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempted liberation of the hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused in the United States a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated adventures, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to a rocky cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a filming team who came to make marks for the shooting of a great sci-fi movie.
Combination of genders
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a realistically designed political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres follow one another: documentary-style sequences from Tehran (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs from the time of the events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been transcribed in the film, there are no great differences),
lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has remarkably restarted his career.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting game ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real events; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject offering in fact few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
He does very well, he sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the Tehran airport is pushed aside by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway are quite pulled by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a greater place and they are, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks some dramatic tension, it is seen with moderate interest, enjoying the direction and retro style of the 70s.
It trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the trick.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the contest of the most absurd rules or ideas from the "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has been considering adopting a 40 percent quota of women for the management of large European companies in recent times was the reason for our decision," said the organiser of the survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have been at the forefront of life insurance rates because they objectively pose less risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations are, for example, the requirement to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, solely because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of hen cages, which has led to higher prices.
Criticism has also been expressed in the past against the de facto prohibition of using the term "sandwich butter" or the withdrawal from the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic is currently imposing the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of lobbyists are also, for example, at the root of the fact that in the Union bananas must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curving".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonizing uneven national standards that complicated trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some states, claiming that existing directives result in food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that air balloons must bear a warning that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a US investigation that said balloons are, among toys, the leading cause of child death from choking.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
At home, too, we have some weird ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the Let-Do association of liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation concerning the volume of food stocks on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and risked, as a result, a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and to grant a grant to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, did not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we have no sea handicaps us.
In the autumn of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), said: "We are going to ask the European Union for a refund.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks that it had then had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The grants for obtaining grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), these were, in concrete terms, to be used to draft grant applications granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Strange regulations are rare".
While the regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and its overall development deserve rather praise.
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but have been imposed by Member States during budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a fight from which it does not always emerge victorious) arouses strong emotions among the Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", for the name "Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum" that dates back to the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, we find today in the company of world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, the cookies of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské sugary"), the carp of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and of T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> ("T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>").
Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> perník") and cakes called "Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice Cornets" ("ho<0xC5><0x99>ické trubi<0xC4><0x8D>ky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not being a senator or a president that matters to me.
If everything went smoothly in our country, I wouldn’t be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see how the country has been looted for the last twenty years, that thieves are not under lock and key, and taxes and retirement ages are rising.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to come up with a solution for it to change.
And since I am over forty years old and independent, a member of no party, I have no other way of influencing the situation than to stand in presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set out for the Castle (N.D.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your backs on those who have chosen you?
I've always said that I'll start the battle for the Castle according to the results of the senatorial elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I were elected a senator, I would stand in the presidential election.
My goal is not function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we mock at the bar or in front of our television set, but also that we trample on those who try to bring about change.
Added to this is the press that breaks people's reputations and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been said about me that I bribe journalists or that I was the adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let’s come to your visions.
You have begun the struggle for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns over twenty million [CZK].
To that end, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I pushed for the profession of a tour guide, I was successful.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly rejected and it delays citizens.
As an independent, non-party member, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each side what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you see yourself as a man of the left or the right?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people place me rather to the left.
For me, whether it’s a little to the left or to the right, it’s not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or SDGs, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone says you’re a populist?
But does what you said not prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without the support of parliament, you only have slogans left.
You won’t survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no choice.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, which was achieved thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without ambiguity, to be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just got into politics and I'm trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying alone to get things moving, and if it doesn't work out, I'm going to stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's a bit like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person cannot make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities and asked them to stand in the senatorial elections as well.
I met Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil frauds.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did did, for the most part, gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are just two independents.
The people have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if every potential member's past is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I also don’t have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand in my “transparent” account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate at about $60 million the value of my personal property.
I have in Prague a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid’s dream: I’ve always loved James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women and fought evil and abuse.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, have a net worth of $60 million and don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don’t want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I do not have any sponsors shows that my program does not arouse much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I could not live with it, for example, paying for my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I would not run for election.
Are you going to continue your business activities so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd put your business down?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be convinced, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large nearby company, tells us: "Yes, this building is indeed beautiful."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Nowadays, no one goes voluntarily to one of these crappy libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeper town that has nothing attractive on the doorstep of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give back some neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a mockery on his face.
And while the jury members were still looking at each other, baffled and shrugging their shoulders, Maas, the brazen, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by activist arguments by a: "common darling!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain sprouted from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and adjoining houses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this small dull town, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall of staggering ugliness, whose white facades invite to think that they house a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural edifice in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under a cheese bell.
It is true that an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you step on the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant street lamps speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls who play ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, library shelves are located along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” explains Willy Maas.
We completely upset the classical spatial configuration and opened up the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been deftly arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panels, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircases.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and building engineers do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager with the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membranes of a millimetre thickness have been used for years as substrates in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and it saves time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be thrown away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books lies beneath a glass bell, the sun illuminates the interior only briefly, even on sunny days.
The thick wooden beams mounted crosswise relative to the glass facade serve as a sun visor, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse’s “finally found soul.”
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure allowed to fill the voids of the library that was not yet completely filled (today it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
Architect Winy Maas once said, “There is nothing worse than a half-empty library.”
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it’s just for decoration.”
This is how MVRDV reached the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and under-educated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans need to play a bigger role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians’ request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
What's the point?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must exercise caution, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being too critical of Israel.
During the insurgency in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Eventually, NATO imposed this measure.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans clashed on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that they are still trying to find this role, but they are on the path to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national dossiers.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the Middle East conflict and abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany has first of all important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to hurt public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Is Germany harming its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto in a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing great understanding of the European position.
But given the country’s political configuration, the government cannot of course defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other hand?
I don't think it makes things easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing on the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will play a locomotive role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Is Germany playing a leading role on the international stage, does Germany just want to play a key role?
Or is it still struggling to take on leading roles?
Germany is still not accustomed to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has difficulty playing a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn’t make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to deal with very diverse neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the US influence on European policy is only diminishing, but right now the EU is not filling that gap, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they do not like it, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less appreciated, it is life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America analyze together the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialised in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Brand Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, she's not sure she'd win.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s Far East property law firm.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few extra letters to register their trademarks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a folder containing the registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and intellectual property infringement.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell practically only counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: its constituents charge it with tackling the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a related brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women are designated who marry rich men.
Chinese officials say they have nothing to blame.
“It’s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,” Pattloch said.
“The brand is sweetened, the uniqueness disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous.”
Financial losses and court costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to data from market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion, the world’s third-largest and fastest-growing luxury goods market.
However, it is not easy to erase dubious registrations from the trademark registry and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch referred to the trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long period, the criticized denomination had become a "market reality".
Pattloch tells us that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought out concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the purchaser of Volvo, used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW, but the dispute was resolved and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost to plagiarists in Hong Kong and Singapore who had redirected the famous crocodile’s gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits, however, to have experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, last year, the office would have moved from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a normality regained".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, representing a 75% increase over the previous year.
However, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Acting is expensive
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth time in a row at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee.
In other words, each registration earned an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs a lot more, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg illustrates.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Admittedly, the Germans were able to obtain that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components be suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany,” says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office therefore rejected the objection of the Munichers.
Freudenberg was successful in the next two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds, "the procedure is long, arduous and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs, and the Archives Service has even had to review the acts of the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered the opposing party a "big six-digit sum in euros" to settle the dispute.
“That’s where we see what it means to us,” Wentzler said.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region ensured the exploitation of the unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file the name Freudenberg in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Watch is necessary."
Pattloch and he advised German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, rather foreigners should "register also in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the final act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir rehearses in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that crosses far more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, one taps one's foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, ladies' slippers and men's loafers look for rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the singers' voices slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano -, they rage, enchant and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years came, from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorister has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Being Helped to Help Oneself
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This sum guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "singer of praise".
No one can speak Bantu fluently in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it brought to Germany to now return it to its native region: South Africa.
For at 8,733 kilometers bird's-eye from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest straw or earthen huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the ills that are plaguing Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is infected with the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in their mid-thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis mostly saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothes, education.
In a poor country without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
In the beginning, it was only a few people who personally pledged to pay a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But barely a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since taken care of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni in an almost professional way.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of five reported cases of syphilis in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), blenorrhea, and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany; however, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common in young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been decreasing.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth from the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white discharge, lower belly pain, and the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or through close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who often changes sexual partners regularly take exams.
Most quickly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all the funds that the choristers raise thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means are accumulating.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well housed, with one of their grandmothers for example.
The gogos, as the old women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, provide them with shelter and ensure that they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many residents.
This is not of course, because although the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wifes
“AIDS is a real taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a subject that touches sexuality.”
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned practices, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Still, condoms are found on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, “but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to promote some cultural exchange, Imbongi choristers travel together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many of the inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus full of whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition that not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears a tear from a few formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
“Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there,” people say there.
And after an 8,733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, in front of these choristers tapping their feet in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA finds ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger spacecraft has reported evidence of ice cover in the planet’s region permanently immersed in shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have struck Mercury.
However, no one links the discovery of water to the hypothesis of life on the planet, says Sean Solomon, chief scientist of the Messenger spacecraft.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other elements essential to life arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which infinity is observed.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the International Astronomical Union's new definition of the term 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the birth room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where the stars are born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer telescope has photographed the flaming glow of a dying star.
The doughnut-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer Telescope has photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, clusters of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope highlights the colors more.
In this infrared photo, the Helice Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent earned it the title of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas in astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturnian moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs ever taken by the Hubble Telescope is that of the Swirl Galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three trails of dust divide the shining heart of the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Snake: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush toward each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope has observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This photo was developed from the optical and radiographic images taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies named Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also constantly create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe he was born shortly after the big bang, when the universe was made up largely of hydrogen.
Our gaze on the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this picture had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, in the Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented in order to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economical construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its high capacity for collecting light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by leveraging the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory which observes the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTF.
A gigantic new telescope is also expected to be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration makes it possible to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been delivering images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mostly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the mission began.
This photo illustrates the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists believe that Mercury’s South Pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger spacecraft in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink butter daily and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which one is still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The journey in the Talysh Mountains is of a twisted romanticism.
At the turn of the many turns of the road, the small bus bums along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, almost like in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group Talysh lives, about whom little is known, except that they speak Persian and Azeri perfectly and have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town boasts an over-aggressive Soviet-era architecture that does not match the picturesque mountain scenery at all.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
We can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
This is my grandfather, he reached the age of 120.
Have another child at 136 years old
But the museum’s controversial star is <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems more than dubious.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he would have conceived a daughter again.
Would <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov have been wrong a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck-Institut in Rostock, also heard of the man in the great age of Central Asia.
"Amazingly old people also live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the non-existence of the documents, not to mention that there was no civil status register.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is true that the people of the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, believes that it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of the people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lived.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical to see in the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a baratta, the contents of which she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have been adults for a long time.
Two small children are also playing in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armadus glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are long braids of a dark blonde that her son proudly reveals to us.
I’ve always washed my hair with milk, and that’s how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly Retirement is Enough to Live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life, I’ve never bought a single piece of food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst times were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who has yet ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He remained in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good way of life in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-greening son is right: “Elders enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution was reborn in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations reveal the country’s deep fracture.
The sharia-based draft constitution is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not greedy with words filled with emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he told state television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also especially for the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
For all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hurriedly written by the Islamic-majority constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night shift are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word “principles” really mean?
This was and still is a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case, this suggests a newly introduced article stating that, with regard to all matters pertaining to Sharia law, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radiance radiates throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will oversee the legislative apparatus, which would result in the de facto tutelage of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts tried to suppress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of art cinematography and literature.
In other words, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution is coming back"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in unusual unity in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, promising to bring down Sharia law before it comes into force.
“The revolution is reborn and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who finished third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft constitution is “to be thrown into the dustbins of history.”
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
“If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said Jasser Said, an opposition leader.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated,” said Khaled Ali, an Egyptian politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges said they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "the people demand the application of the law of God."
“Clean up our country!” they asked Morsi, claiming that “the Qur’an [was] their Constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty in the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have engendered a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said opponents of the draft constitution, along with its supporters, had spoken out loud.
According to them, now is the time to let the people decide by the ballot box the direction that the country must take.
The project of the Islamists will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he laments during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi’s powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will engender a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto strips him of all his powers,” Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between different political ideologies on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could pay off.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "you are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway’s rakfisk: Is it the most odorous fish in the world?
The five million people who populate Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the locals' appetite for an extremely odorous fish?
Take some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty soccer clothing.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s most popular dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this ubiquitous smell permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can last up to a year.
When darkness sets in and it is cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid making it pass under your nose, it's not bad - it reminds me of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels and then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - undoubtedly with the senses diminished by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, albeit odorous, element of Norway’s past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 each.
Norway is not often featured in international news, which is not to her displeasure.
Here, people are unwilling to talk about Anders Breivik, the extremist right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about the “22 July incident.”
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their own could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
“But oil isn’t the only reason for our success,” says Anna, our blonde-haired waitress with piercing blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being, with a tray of rakfisk in her hand.
We are - as you say - cautious people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything except a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money out the window in the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway kept its stock market tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand under the snow and line up to buy food - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger made of élan, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where one serves rakfisk for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelly of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It looks like a Eurovision contest.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, BBC’s Will Grant looks at the difficulties ahead and the people’s expectations, which are numerous.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are rampant in normal times, a security barrier has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nonetheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, the results owed to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is plagued by a drug war that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populous and sprawling state that encloses the capital. On his favorite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The locals attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevices.
Plaques bearing his name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to bring about lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and of the PRI's Pena Nieto party.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so much needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years spent outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lack of charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more egregious.
Hidden under highway bridges, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly severe.
In a disaster area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on the landfill edge.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place infamous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in the face.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the cadaveric stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was refused.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made a promise that he will make it his priority during his tenure.
"I hope he will be as good as when he was governor," Olvera said in Valle del Bravo, a congressman.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained about ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning was allegedly subjected to while in detention.
The trial is about Manning’s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's abduction took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to show Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of causing the largest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. military, has missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During cross-examination with Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense filed an application demanding that the Manning case be closed on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning expressed his desire to commit suicide while in detention.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday’s hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers had filled out after meeting with Manning, during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he had received from his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had within the prison was overall "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had expressed concerns orally about certain issues and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would address them, but they did not record the issues raised.
“They wrote ‘no problems’ (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn’t mean I hadn’t raised any problems,” Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed to indicate a “risk of injury.”
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was okay, and I wanted to be removed from that status ... so I could have a better quality of life from my perspective,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Marine Corps base military prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide while in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- alone.
Manning also added that the only items he had at his disposal were a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also made it clear that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so that he could see his face.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint about Manning’s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after he was forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge’s questions Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard’s order that he had to drop his blanket that could have hidden his nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop her.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic in his brief or flip-flops to injure himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he had during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is convicted before a court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning is considering pleading guilty to the lesser offenses and fighting for the dropping of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of national defense-related information.
If all the charges are detained, he faces life imprisonment.
The Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two routes: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which line to go to.
I grew up in central California, where I’ve been called the “Mexican” all my life.
It’s an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves “Irish,” or my friends in New York when they call themselves “Italian.”
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here it was Mexico.
And on the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualification or a bond.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed to the "Foreigners" queue.
I thought about that moment of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than take risks in the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada, and create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory in writing at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, did not find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most of the time, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have been to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that this is the American dream we are living, and not the dream of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they hair us as if we were individuals of lower and not sufficiently Mexican stock.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexican-Americans are upset.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she has a sense of being part of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a superb country that we absolutely must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
It's not going to happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, given the pervasive wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to take care of yourself, amigos.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want them for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments for who started persist, dozens of buildings have been crushed to dust; over 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full mutation.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to think that it could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that does not make any losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
While the November 21 ceasefire continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast of forcing the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has been beaten.
Having killed some of its leaders and driven Gaza’s 1.7 million people back into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing stronger, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a burgeoning regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken up the cause for Hamas; as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and most dynamic states.
Hamas members are cheering and saying that the Islamist crescent is bending around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its dominance, through Syria, where Islamist-leaning rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and most central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are Hamas cousins, and their leaders are more easily reliant on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in the box.
The missile interception system dubbed the Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America is renewing its unwavering support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, notably under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, notably thanks to the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more bellicose party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the good side.
Why pamper these damn Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they were running the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as they get their heads out.
Perhaps hardliners will win; but it may be that the Arab Spring is changing the game.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere have little appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to settle their economies.
Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to secure a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in Israeli-occupied territories — much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people on each side, and by most of the outside world, and by this newspaper: two states, with a surrender of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to halt the flow of arms to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to establish one.
This is a very narrow view.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarette packets have come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of brand
This law that came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific photos of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by their parents’ smoking.
Apart from the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all the packages.
It is the world's strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.
Tobacco makers said it would revive black market trade, which would make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
“There will be negative consequences from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to Australia's high court.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV ads, sports sponsorship and requiring retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by local businesses and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you’re working in tobacco marketing and you only have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the go-to place par excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noticed an increase in contributions from some lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has bothered to make a video, or if this is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the current new regulation rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although neither of these countries has had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries about similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos mandatory on packaging in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stricter laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know them.
“You take a cigarette and you put the package away,” Victor El Hage said as he bought a package with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'll ever get arrested is because of my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack Tobacconist" in central Sydney, said the uniformity of the packaging made it difficult to store the packages on the shelves.
“Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specializing in child development are praising boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes, I did.
No, you don't.
But I'll come back.
First, like many people, I thought boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that’s not the case, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of “Boredom: A Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The boredom goes back a long way,” he said.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of “wanting to do something but failing to engage in satisfactory activity.”
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though they would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What’s at the heart of the boredom, he said, is “the interruption of the process of attention, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two can be linked, people who are bored tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are bored when in fact it is a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened on cassette to the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard the loud sound of a TV show that was unrelated from the next room, others just heard the TV show, and the third group didn't hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had a hard time concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or demanding task, a pause in attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, "like looking at objects on an editing line, music can help you not to be bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you wriggle or scratch, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to grope learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay motionless,” Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monochord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a “Predisposition to Boredom Scale” in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, “Among the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and need many and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasted.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He found that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not in school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know if today’s boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “teenage is a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” not least because children and teens don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I reconsider my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he will not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to take care of himself or self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just like I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant bubbling generated by activities and technology is the goal we should aim for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom arouses a keen, frenzied desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate downtime.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to jump into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directives for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and soccer player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana pellets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Orozco said that one day in September, he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and material that could be used for his consumption - misdemeanors, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado’s vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in Washington state, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving marijuana use have been dismissed.
Police have stopped indicting adults 21 years of age and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative constituencies have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to indict people who own it.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana stores in their neighborhoods.
“Things are moving so fast that I don’t know what the future holds,” said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police for Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a licensing system, authorizing the production, manufacture, distribution and sale - by the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first with respect to therapeutic use and now with respect to personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and it’s a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent on which we could rely,” he said.
Washington’s I-502 law takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal void, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
In the meantime, practical questions remain unresolved: how to balance the state mandate that ensures appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales shops within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or nursery.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis trade, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Center, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an email to his officers announcing that the “City attorney” would no longer prosecute people 21 years of age and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop indicting people for this type of crime “with effect immediately.”
Chief Oates said police would enforce new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to handle marijuana possession cases, primarily in order to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to prosecute those individuals who have committed an offence which, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence,” Buck said.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favor of restricted marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer have adults appear for possession of limited quantities.
The county prosecutor’s representative, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to immediately close all marijuana detention cases.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
While 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
“This is a cultural barrier” with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They spent a good part of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so they have a hard time accepting that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are on the verge of becoming a case law for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are anticipating a new frontier of legalized sales, they are looking forward to guidance from the federal government, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will give in.
Despite some publicized arrests of medical marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana stores to operate in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
While it’s true that police are likely not going to push through doors to seize small bags of drugs, there’s a good chance they’re opposed to licensed personal-use marijuana stores authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana stores, even if this is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
“We don’t want to end up in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not just today’s students who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far back as I can remember, I have always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was to me an eminent place of knowledge, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were baffled.
The newspaper of The Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson facultatively stated that I had left after being forced to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been bullied and bullied constantly.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative Party supporter.
Why talk about that today, you might tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students is suffering the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Student Room (JCR) said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable” because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, devoted to student politics and depicting the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
This included student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who travels in a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and travels with a chrome-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as scapegoats for setting up higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper “there is a growing left bias in universities.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who has proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right.
“This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the well-being of members,” she said.
I was the only one who thought that way during my first few weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and a paralyzing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher – a former student – an honorary degree, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was filled with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know each other and the teachers, I had a foretaste of what was going to happen next.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in the sarcasm towards Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on strike miners, privatization and the government’s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved into the woods of classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was a victim of was a translation of 18th-century French texts into English, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a small man with a pustular face, was easily angry.
“Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest you take French classes during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
During dinner that night, I sat alone and then felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
It was a second-year student of English, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said, gently.
I'm afraid that's the case.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me already, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be even harder for you.
Most of the Tory youth claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs. Thatcher had said.
This ploy has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took up the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
“How do the Tories make love?” asked one of them.
They beat each other up, didn’t they?”
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I have just led a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have become a Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I began to shuttle between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded city family and friends.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and explained to him why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But this is the best place in the world,” he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city of dreaming bell towers.
Even my communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a working session conducted the following week, when another history professor suggested most seriously in the world that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Inwardly blushing with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents’ brainwashing and called them “old madmen.”
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who put the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I was stuck in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can call me a wet weeping hen.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couturier.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized this during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his fashion house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the highlight of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until next March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the modest couturier of the northern Italian town of Voghera to the international jet-set idol.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his cottage in Gstaad," says the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate friend of past beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to have dinner at his apartment.
There were about 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
"He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Lineage of Nobility Parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes well-bred people and with the biggest headlines and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium of sixty meters wide that proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade on the podium to admire a "public" of dreams carrying the main creations of Valentino, like the tailor that had chosen Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to a furnace or "Victoria" to Onassis.
Among this public of models are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of her clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trouser, a shirt, a "gillet" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the couturiers’ muses.
"I prefer him to all the others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimes our beauty," added the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and brighten the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino model either.
When she was a teenager living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Eventually, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bustier and a falling neckline.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the dresses of the couturier with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that it conveys".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve kinds of different lace and a four and a half meters trail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the late twentieth century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Obsessed for years by the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of his clients.
“His refinement, his calm, his neat and perfect look have always jumped in my eyes,” admits d’Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my best friends.
"He was impeccable, years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says so...
The world’s toughest job: Kawah Ijen’s human mules
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas emanating from the earth's bowels solidifies on contact with air.
After harvesting large sulfur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilograms, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters above sea level, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb that distance, to a turtle-like pace, keeping balance and measuring their steps so as not to trip and fall into the precipice.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur extracted.
Once at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and carrying painfully the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers up to the scale that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 meters of altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) per kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.8) per trip," says Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each one takes him 3 hours and he finishes exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times as much as he would earn in the fields.
“The income of miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the bearer who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I converted her to Java.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Driven by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he does the work of a mule.
He shares an unhealthy lumbering with other porters, gets up every day at two in the morning because sulfur does not stop gushing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater and lights up with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers carry the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they do not touch one under the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) surcharge per camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for animals, not humans,” said Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent carrier who has worked at Kawah Ijen for 30 years since leaving college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can" because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases ... to which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders.
By balancing the basket on his back, the 53-year-old Unainik can only carry 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth and revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but the perpetual misery from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this lack of children on the career, stress and cost of accessing property.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem implausible that these lyrics come from an advertisement for mint lozenges, but despite that, or perhaps thanks to that, the video spread like a powder keg on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polychinelle in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way through this advertising.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill "their national duty."
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it fun and entertaining.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that this was a theme that we had to address.
We knew the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, what could be more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, said it was due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family building,” she said.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound in barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese people who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore experienced its worst election results since independence last year.
Since the election, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun controlling the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are being built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to propose too many small dwellings in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If so much is that these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that’s why people put it off,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to have my money and my time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from intrusion".
What is the private domain for children under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces by posting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term “something very personal” on a personal level and “password and username” when they applied it to social networks.
“I won’t reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them but not everyone,” he says.
On FB, I post cool pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I’m not going to share one of my photos or someone who would be an idiot,” he said.
The boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they’re answering me, I’m just posting them,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends, quickly,” he says.
He said he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Neither will he trust anyone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of José, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people registered on his list of friends.
“It doesn’t bother me because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one made any advances to him or asked for his address or telephone number.
“If they pressured me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account,” he said.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences known today as cyberbullying are not foreign to the young boy.
A friend of mine has been hacked into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just passed it on in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or upset.
“Even though I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that, to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a way to search for information, but with the emergence of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she said.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are the ones, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we ourselves are learning,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a definite criterion on what they should or should not disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so."
“We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
“Saying not to do it is useless,” she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to publish a photo of you like a friend you posted?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you’re doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Outside of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she said.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and education advisor, says it is essential for parents to read the terms of use of social networks thoroughly.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to strangers.
The Unasur summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Foreign Ministry and the presidency initially indicated that it would be leaked after the summit closes, then said it would be published at any time on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the journalists was that given by the press attachés of some of the governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document leaked during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the summit’s “final statement,” but it was President Humala’s speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South America-Arab Summit (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it was urgently requested by the press, it had not released the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited to the maximum the obtaining of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that settles a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both parties in the lawsuit that Lima filed against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are bringing today before this international court,” President Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of international controversies, treaties and courts,” Piñera said, shaking hands with Humala, standing next to the two countries’ flags.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely erroneous.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from UNASUR since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He said actions would be put in place to improve “cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, cheap internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters.”
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and foresee a better future for our peoples”, concluded President Humala.
"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," he said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were located on the transverse axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give further details.
Similarly, the outcome document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“We will review all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask to have a discussion with this country,” he said.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the framework of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "had killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President supported the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of diminishing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on human rights.
Those who give us back our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but on the contrary he respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish justice system, which has demanded that he submit to interrogation on its territory regarding an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish legislation allows this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to do exercises in the open air.
“It affects everyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the attribution of a founder safe-conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he points out that he has had discussions in London to find a Wiki's solution to the problem.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings before different European bodies,” he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted safe-conduct as early as tomorrow, it would be over."
And if Sweden, as fully permitted by its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, interviewed Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or interviewed him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and made it clear that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies that undermine freedom of expression".
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malevolent or perverse politicians but bad journalists on the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed that it is not these kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than promoting his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue on the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality "it destroys the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers that the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty, is "perfectly relevant".
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We must solve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile within the same tribunal and said that it is "beneficial for Latin America to seize international forums if the two countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it is".
Referring to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to running for a third consecutive term, he noted that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa said that if he lost the February 2013 primaries, he would retire from public life.
On a personal level, power has never interested me, but in situations as unfair as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one guaranteeing this eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it will be my last term in office and then I will retire from politics.
If we ever lose, I will too.
“It’s my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to be HIV positive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to inquire about him and his hard work was such that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 90s, where there were a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him “because he was speechless.”
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, “depleted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes for reference that this information was validated in a scientific year in April.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a life-threatening disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immune system involvement that patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better rates for those not using drugs reaching up to 50 years and up to 200 years.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who receives an HIV-positive diagnosis at age 25, "as long as he remains under control, he can live without problems up to 75 years," the scientist said.
In order to put this progress in context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deaths from AIDS has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients identified in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths as of May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral medicines has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we have never run out of drugs, the problem is that patients are coming to very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or they are learning it at advanced stages of the disease.
Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, we must offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who ask for it.
The specialists and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffered from a complication of the sarcoma.
Everything changes when you learn you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better that I have fun three times a week,” they say, but that’s not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents know only that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and to the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
Let them take the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packets of one hundred, it is very good, but it results, that even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, the journalist says.
He proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at the counters, but that they be found in public toilet dispensers and in places where young people frequent.
This is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying for the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
“This is not how sexuality works, it’s best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,” he said.
Numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The State is the 4th state in the country in the number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of contamination is sexual, 6% is bloodborne and 2% is perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for every recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of Vitro Group’s debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario sets a damaging precedent for all national companies with branches in the neighboring country and with solvency problems.
Therefore, it seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas on June 15 leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s leading glassmaker to sue the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the trial judge points out that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, states that the main proceeding is commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the inter-company vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
Here are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the subsidiaries' votes remained, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the US courts, i.e. the "vault" funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A fact omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had been facing since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, repercuting costs on the country.
For the time being, the company of the González Sada family will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is to say with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance remedy will claim non-prosperity and require review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
More serious is the fact that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that this freed him from the conventions signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he noted that the country had complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvencies, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-part carambolage: they beat up Vitro and they beat up the country.
Balance sheet
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were silenced for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the trust F/589 of bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They besiege the Dragon Mart
Meeting at a Caribbean University amphitheatre over the weekend, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad opposition front to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal center of sales and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the Southeast Area to oppose the monumental project, which is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all the threats to the industry.
The ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico's ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was a good thing that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, because it was seen as an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball globetrotter "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life relating to the field and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of local basketball history as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage sentenced him to wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether it was as a player of lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the low-ball of the national team.
"I have worn several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 90s," Reyes recalls during a Primera Hora visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate when he makes that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his out-of-the-ordinary itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves the most are those that remind him of his time as a player with the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"These have been my best years, the ones I have enjoyed the most because I have had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or manager.
It has been many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired at the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a strong player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
This is how Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had, began.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another one.
He enjoyed the championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's duties in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came in 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn’t made us play the last game again, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as was the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we beat the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only made up of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the World Cup 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy during the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hurruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Piculín Ortiz.
His international tournament stats are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as did Piculín.
And this without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's very hard to say.
We had a good team made up of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arill.
What is your biggest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the national team's most glorious era between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There are things I would have liked to have put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their own area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the benefit of compulsory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
The death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved the most again,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an exceptional person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted to drinking heavily for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and underwent a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had become known on television in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his film roles are critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman found his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their loved ones aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan “Who Killed J.R.?”, coined to keep the suspense surrounding an emotionally charged episode in which Hagman’s character is nearly murdered, has sparked speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screens and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
“I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R,” Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life".
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The five-episode recording has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is underway, the network said.
So far, neither Warner nor TNT have announced how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who gained fame with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on stage in New York theatres in the early 1950s and served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I haven’t written anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I go with them when they come to have surgery and after," he said in 1996.
I try to offer them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it'll be fine."
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing an irresistible hook: the end of the "great tally" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, which many people refer to as proof of the impending end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the coming months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax pit that some have dubbed “the Armageddon of debt” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end times thought the apocalypse would start.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we told it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to lecture on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We're analyzing this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled “The End of the World.”
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn’t disappear,” Professor Restall said.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work “until the very night of the supposed end of the world,” Restall said.
The classes proved to be quite popular.
“It was complete in two hours,” Restall said of his 35-student high-level course.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us to believe in the end-of-the-world date of December 21.
“Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old senior in Temple, West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to such speculation.
“In other parts of the world, people don’t think about that,” he said.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that classes were being given here on "the end of the world."
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it were an exception coming from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, there has been talk of the many supposed dates of the Last Judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us that they thought they were going to "end of the world" parties.
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
