Members of the Assembly of Wales worried about 'posing as puppets'
Welsh elected officials are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposed change of the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of mockery.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that the acronym “rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For non-Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crap.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) was not "satisfied" and proposed alternatives.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet, the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the English letter u of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the name change, said that “the final decision on the naming of the members of the Assembly rests with the latter”.
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 grants the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the question of the title of members, the Commission looks in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Welsh prefer MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could prove to be a real headache for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on the name change in the coming weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the issue of name during the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on Change of Country Name
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted that the name of Macedonia constitutes a claim on its territory and has repeatedly vetoed its neighbouring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed the referendum, said he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: Churches in trouble, bells of St. Martin silenced
“The elderly people I talked to say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams says.
“There aren’t any more today.”
According to him, it is normal that bars have become scarce.
Today, “we don’t date in the same way anymore,” he explains.
“Before, we used to go to the bar like our neighbors, but that’s not the case anymore.”
As for the churches, the funds coming from the sale of buildings will run out long before what the leaders imagine and this worries him: "sooner or later, they will return to the starting point".
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
“The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely white people who will rush to the closure of all the churches because they are unlikely to become members,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The initial White Methodist congregation abandoned the site in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which was preaching in the vicinity, took possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, in which blacks struggled to get employed or promoted.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but the parishioners of Father Johnson prepared to rebuild and ordered a new chime,
that Father Johnson’s son and successor at the head of St. Martin’s Church, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the “bells of the poor.”
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
It also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took his place in front of the largest carillon in Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather states that Saint Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, there has been much talk about the upheaval of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the secular elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay leaders, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter would impose the costs incurred, even though it had not participated in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-Year-Old Wounded by Shark During Lobster Fishing Game
Authorities said a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing lobster fishing in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego television channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and began paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought the boy was screaming for joy at having gotten a hold, then he realized that in reality he
He had been bitten.
Approaching the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the collarbone.
“I was screaming for everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark!’” Chad explains.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark at the origin of the attack is not known.
At a news conference, Chief Rescue Officer Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's Offensive Plans in the UK Aesthetics Market
Sainsbury's makes low hand on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and fills them with supermarket-like shelves, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion UK aesthetics market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and home goods are falling, more extensive beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves conclusive.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market with the goal of reusing the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic items, which for the first time will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also have more space in areas similar to those of boutiques such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
Fragrance Shop will also test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and a second scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket executives need to dig their heads up to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to shop online and head to local shops for everyday food products.
Mike Coupe, general manager of Sainsbury's, said retail outlets will increasingly resemble supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to counter discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened several Habitat stores since the two chains were bought two years ago, which, according to the group, has boosted sales of consumer goods and made acquisitions profitable.
Earlier attempts to restructure the British chain's pharmaceutical and cosmetics department stores had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended a controversy over the distribution of profits from pharmacies in supermarkets.
It was after selling its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty shelves has been changed to improve the setting for customers.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer wise advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any need and, thanks to the embellishment of our shelves and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undeniable and changes purchasing habits," added Mr. Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' Anger After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Anger from TV show Dragon's Den star Peter Jones after the announcement of the withdrawal of host Holly Willoughby from an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract related to her home decor brand, to devote herself to her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to take care of the Truly brand of interior decoration and accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their fruitful textile and interior design business at the last minute, to devote herself to her new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the TV’s beloved child revealed, at a tense meeting at the headquarters of the Dragon’s Den star’s commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their interior decoration and accessories brand.
The Truly brand was equated with actress Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop, and could have doubled the value of the entertainer’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped in her private jet to one of her second homes outside of Britain.
According to one source, “Truly was by far one of Holly’s top priorities.
and in the process of securing its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is full of products ready to sell.”
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning hostess, who is among Britain’s most “bankable” celebrities, could cause the company to lose millions, due to large investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or interiors, and the risk of a delayed launch.
This could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones held 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was heated, but in the end we adored each other
Trump mocked the media that criticized him because of his comment that some deem “unworthy of a president,” and for being so positive towards the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He laughed, taking the voice of a TV reporter.
“I gave up nothing at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un was in favour of holding a second meeting after Trump called the first meeting, which took place in Singapore in June, a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no "corresponding response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his rallying speech, Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“Everything is going well with North Korea,” the US president said.
We have come close to the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of North American military personnel to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, there’s barely more than 200 people standing in front of me,” he said, pointing to the crowd.
Tsunami: an island devastated and hundreds killed in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the help of foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok was scattered, but no state of national disaster was declared, which was a prerequisite for international aid to be triggered.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it clear that they do not want international aid, which makes things a little more complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it still doesn’t know if field work will be allowed.
National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Sutopo said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant shaking, the country is cruelly lacking in the means to protect itself from the whims of nature.
Shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm sirens sounded in Palu, which may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed dilapidated infrastructure reform at the centre of his election campaign and has spent considerable sums to rehabilitate roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has undermined Mr Joko's government, which is expected to run in front of voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure related to the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative way.
More than 1,000 Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven from their homes amid clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge manages to equalise against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge spares a defeat at Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute, Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led 1–0.
He shoots into the ball on his left, before escaping a shot to the second post.
The ball flew over the repair surface before heading to the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended its way to the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to place myself, to grab the ball, but players like Shaq always shoot as far as possible, so I tried to save as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really thinking much I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker heeled a pass to Mateo Kovacic, before rushing to the midfield and sprinting to Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick back and forth in midfield,
He then made a magnificent deep shot that drove Hazard to the surface.
Hazard overcame the defense and finished his race in the net of the second post, with a left foot shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Neapolitans in the group stage of the Champions League, Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: Tsunami death toll rises to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami was 832.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered 6-metre-high waves, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was dotted with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman stabbed was found in John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police are urging neighborhood residents who have seen or heard something to testify.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has only just begun, but I would like to ask anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I appeal in particular to taxi drivers, who could have captured something on their dashcam and ask them to provide us with any crucial information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found at a property in Birkenhead where she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is underway and police said they were informing the victim's close relatives.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his Grayson Mews apartment, with police not allowing anyone to enter or exit the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene,
Repeating, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and one outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inside of the cordon.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Failure anonymously at 0800 555 111, as indicated in register 247 dated September 30.
Parliament: Cromwell statue, last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as the fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society found Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it a "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "Given the current debate around the removal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's statue erected in front of the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell did not order or conduct iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to the esteem we had for him in the nineteenth century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, I mean of the monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the fracture.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated.”
China: a pig kills a farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeast China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, artery cut and covered in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the neighboring pig store was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was flowing from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutilated the breeder to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the breeder’s cousin, said “his legs were crushed and covered in blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News the animal was locked up to prevent further incidents and allow police to gather evidence.
The family of the breeder Mr. Yuan and the market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pig attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016, on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously injuring the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig stuck a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to drive him away.
In 2012, when an Oregon farmer had just been eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that it was not in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They’re pretty playful animals.
Very curious kids... they have no intention of harming you.
Just show them the respect they deserve,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains are expected to cause heavy rainfall in southeastern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northeast coast.
However, Rosa will cause showers in northeastern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
The winds were blowing at 135 km/h (Hurricane Category 1) since 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula in the form of a storm on Monday, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity northwards in the southwestern United States.
It will rain up to 25 cm in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the Southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall reaching between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause sudden dangerous floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Rainfall will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to rain between 5 and 10 cm in southwestern regions, including much of Arizona.
Scattered tropical rainfall could lead to sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Intense rainfall could turn the canyons into wild rivers and thunderstorms will produce gusts of wind and dust whirlwinds in places.
The approaching depression will result in heavy local rainfall in some southern parts of the country on the California coast.
The rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
It could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, then intensify later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will fall across the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will experience considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures circling around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other regions of the northeast.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the seasonal average.
Multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television channels on Thursday, the eye-opening hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
As the political deadlock lingered, broadcasters interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a teaser: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford said she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had indulged in touching her person and had tried to remove her clothes during a party between high school students.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, also claimed to be 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen does not always manage to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
By comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the most watched channel on audition day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC was in second place with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), according to Nielsen.
Interest did not wane once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was being played on Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is taken aside by protesters as he tries to take the elevator to get to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake lowered his eyes for several minutes, while CNN broadcast the sequence of the interpellation live.
“Don’t look away, look at me,” said one of the women.
“Do you really believe he’s telling the truth?
You hold power when so many women are destitute.”
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office issued a statement and he would say more at the commission meeting.
All cable and broadcast networks covered the live session a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the procedure to advance Kavanaugh's appointment by the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the allegations made against the candidate, which the minority Democrats demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
His choice weighed heavily on the scales, as the Republicans would not have obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual assault allegations.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making ‘small politics’
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of making “small politics” at the expense of Britain’s future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May on the cover, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on her so-called Chequers plans, saying the free trade proposal between Britain and the European Union was “purely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of killing LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, was nailed and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
The glasses were found at the scene of the crime and carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton-Rouge Parish Medical Examiner’s office on Friday released a preliminary report, which determines that the death was caused by a bullet wound that went through the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service acknowledges assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the state police forensic laboratory, Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “dedication and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “devastated and in shock” after the news of Wayde’s death.
“We fear this kind of thing all the time,” Wade said.
Mexico: A volcano spits ash
The ash escaping from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Reduction recommended that Mexicans stay away from the volcano, after experiencing a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center monitored several rumblings and tremors from Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano located 72 km from the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists on the anniversary of independence vote
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repressed by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating clouds of dust in the streets, which usually do not fill tourists.
Clashes also erupted later in the day, as police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "neither forgetting nor forgiving" faced Unionist supporters shouting "long live Spain".
14 demonstrators with minor injuries were treated, according to the local press.
A year after the referendum held on 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain high in the independence region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with secessionists largely boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independence groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
It did, however, take place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was participating with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he had no hope for Catalonia’s independence.
“We witnessed a great moment last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in a dead end,” he laments.
Despite their capital, albeit slim, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained pending trial for holding the referendum and declaring Catalonia’s independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming the demonstration of support for the police on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on both sides.
“The tension is only rising,” he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting a trial since last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,” he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men hit a house in a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly running into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also reportedly shot with arrows.
Livingston wins game 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's victory
Recently rising in the ranks, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers with a second win in 18 games for Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place in 2nd position of the standings, tied with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of away wins in the Premiership league this season, and must face the 8-point lead Hearts team on Sunday.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Rapid de Vienne on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston are extending their undefeated career in the division by six games, and head coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, can boast that he hasn't lost a single game yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of blunt opponents
Holt's team could have taken a lead well before scoring, as their direct approach was putting the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to break through but was stuck in front of the opposing goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a header by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing that they could hamper them through hard-working tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied to catch Menga, who took a touchdown and scored a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but were faced with an impenetrable defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half had the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor halted Scott Pittman's strike, while Lithgow managed to thwart one of Livingston's plans.
Livingston's goalkeeper rebuffed all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were denied by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a foul hand.
The "phenomenon" of Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and team composition have hardly changed since they returned to the top, but the credit goes largely to Holt for having since his arrival motivated a team.
There are a lot of great players.
Captain Halkett’s defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in breath throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level reached with Gerrard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed one last chance and only managed to break through to the opposing side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the board.
Mixed welcome of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues were addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into his country.
The cleavage that emerges from the protests reflects Erdogan’s double vision: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and described as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies as a result of a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. local time near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescue arrived on the spot, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after a cyclist died on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that occurred on Saturday, the driver had fled.
London police said officers were doing everything they could to identify the individual and warn his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus detours have been set up. It is advisable for motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 Officers Injured in Riot
The head of the high-security men’s prison said six prison officers were injured in a riot.
The riot began at the HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and is still not under control.
Special anti-riot officers were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a wing of the prison.
Officers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesperson for the prison’s management said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot police were sent to the prison to halt a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the staff with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by flash floods (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
A tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but that's likely to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading to the southwestern desert with what's left of its energy. This region could be hit by flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with predictable rains starting Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have retained the depression or tropical storm stage within a 300km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center's latest estimates predict 5 to 10 cm of rainfall, and up to 15 cm in places in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to experience 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with total isolated measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa rains could be lifesaving for drought-affected areas that are not at risk of sudden flooding.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rainfall could be beneficial to the southwestern region given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring System, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least one extreme-grade drought, the second most severe category.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey on the coast, in the Baja California peninsula.
Still powerful on Sunday morning and generating winds of up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located at 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves northward at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday night.
In some areas of Mexico, rainfall could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of rainfall is expected from Lower California northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, crossing Arizona and southern Utah in the evening on Tuesday.
"Torrental rains are expected in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert and are the main danger," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that this rainfall will result in life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted homicide after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 4 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is currently stable.
Police in Avon and Sommerset said they arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) overnight on the side of Radstock.
Officers made a call to people who may have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Was Victim of Democrats' Wickedness and Anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous methods,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed Kavanaugh had been a victim of the wickedness and anger of Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress Thursday, energetically and emotionally rejecting allegations by Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” today.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service,” he told a crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he mentioned the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first decisive procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a statement from a Republican aide to CNN.
Indonesia: earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds, the toll continues to grow
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them swept away by huge waves that hit the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu, when six-metre-high waves overwhelmed the beach at nightfall, taking many lives and destroying everything in their path.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not happen alone, it drove cars, pieces of wood, homes, it took everything with it," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s earthquake was 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she said.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of buildings in ruins, he added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the human and material losses could be greater on the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were “completely paralyzed” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to disseminate information that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officers said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man upstairs in a building frantically shouting to passers-by on the street as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun delivering aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but evacuees still have a high need for food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has reopened as part of rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia: The number of victims of the tsunami is increasing, there are more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where they took refuge in tent shelters in the backyard of their offices and discovered scenes of devastation along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began assisting the disaster victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel can enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami hit Palu, relatives of the missing people were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days near her mother's body.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi said.
“As an elder in the discipline of paragliding, I have experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu who were attending the festival on the beach.
His messages remained unanswered.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
In Newport on the Levee, thieves steal $26,750 while reloading an ATM
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was charging a vending machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a dispenser in the entertainment complex and preparing to power it, Inspector Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money destined for the ATM.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West Changes Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now known as Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before heading to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Her appearance replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current pseudo-professional, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West explained earlier this year, evoking the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us.
I went from Kanye, which means “the only one”, to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the hyphen and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO declares that he will never resort to military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly 50 years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire during a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly student allowances and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people to join criminal gangs.
The US should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States is expected to double its funding dedicated to research in this sector, according to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made AI-related announcements, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are one step ahead of the United States, and we’re looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” says Lee.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of AI will come from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, then joined the Microsoft Reasearch management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has previously participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that owns the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers,” he says.
China’s State Council unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation working to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has taken no action in several months.
Macedonians participate in referendum on their country’s name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard in a referendum on the change of their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of Macedonia’s majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts as to whether a minimum of 50 percent turnout would be required to validate the referendum.
The referendum question was: “Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of my country, for Macedonia's youth, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union. It means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that mobilized 66% of registered voters at the end of the vote.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the name change, in order to open the voice for a membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepares a small stage and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, accession to NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
“I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after dropping his ballot.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published on Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected turnout.
Another poll, organized by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated the turnout at 57%.
70% of those intending to vote said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50% of the votes plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power last May.
Decisive action: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton’s defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the game 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero’s goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the easiest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine scorer received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed one defender before ousting the others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took the opportunity to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to cheat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-handed shot.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he’d play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Skyblues the initial lead in the Premier League game.
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the Brighton court.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second post.
The Skyblue forward sent the ball into the nets just before sliding off the court.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the party troublemaker against the Rockies
As the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of a playoff game for the Rockies, true legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Even though this game is not at stake, we want to get on the pitch in Denver, with that atmosphere, with the crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a pitcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to give way to Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with an average earned points of 2.53 and 300 withdrawals on catches in 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's Interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation generated by his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“All of our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s a major issue. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they're crushing to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
The Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see it over the last four days,” he added, before calling the Democrats “angry, mean and lying people.”
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him public acclaim.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you divulge the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm expecting one. It was very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the large community it was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are not welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My colleague Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself was at odds with the previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said: “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
This is exactly what the Friday evening general assemblies were during my eight years as a Labour Party parliamentarian.
Unfortunately, this is not the case today with many gatherings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long since been forgotten, if ever taken into consideration.
It has become clear that opposing opinions are no longer tolerated within the party; each opinion is judged on its acceptability by the party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy took office, and the colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political vision began to expect me to turn over my jacket and take positions that are contrary to my beliefs, whether it is on national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive social media tirade, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be a party member.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that were addressed to me were of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a flurry of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current politics is the normalization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that large community and that the party narrows down through the no-confidence motions and the changes to the selection rules.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years: look down, don’t express my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But it is not to do so that I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy because the negligence of Thatcher's government had caused my classroom to collapse, and since then I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or minister of government.
I never hid my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and by my differences with the current party officials.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is moving towards a Brexit that is going to affect households, businesses and utilities. I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the leader of the party.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes that I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for the riding of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains undefeated
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result, but no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day match of the Scottish XV Rugby Championship.
The team now holds the top spot and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this match.
“So far we’ve been tested, but we remain undefeated, so I have to feel happy!” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they were more effective than us and they were able to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute test, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish squad Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to get the numbers up.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the halftime. He scored and transformed a single try to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr on the break.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s rehearsal, transformed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
A long wait ensued because of a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher.In the recovery, Ayr took the lead with a test of Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an untransformed rehearsal by Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team got back on track and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's progressing maul.
Climo transformed the test, as almost every time since the resumption, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong’s box kick and sent forward Gregor Henry away for the team’s fifth home test.
The star of Still Game embarks on restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in catering. The actor was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and coanimates with his longtime stage partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's finale, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "thriving restaurant industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blockaded, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol an armored boat in the naval headquarters of La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motto: "The sea returns to us by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout blockaded Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still present. Just as the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades, Bolivia awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of the Bolivian request. Bolivia wants that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about Monday’s decision.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will rule in favor of Chile, and that little would change, even in the event of a positive decision.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice rendered its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have even hurt him.
“The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ bellicose rhetoric undermined all the remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very complicated to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - who remains to this day one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we need to get rid of the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the US
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would not get rid of its nuclear weapons until it had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of reviving nuclear diplomacy in a deadlock more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, North Korea's current leader.
Ri says it is “chimerical” to think that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that will end the Korean War will make the North bend.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of significant prior disarmament measures on the part of Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness about giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows reveal the latest trends in headwear, perhaps soon available in your stores
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun 100%, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of delusional oversize hats at a PE19 fashion show that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Hats all more extravagant than each other have invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators have decided to incorporate their delightful pieces into the fashion shows.
Valentino's flagship piece was an eccentric beige hat adorned with a wide edge evoking a feather, which engulfed the heads of the models.
Other oversize accessories included watermelons adorned with jewelry, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple. But these pieces weren't designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had sewn lips and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment, with snorkel and glasses, while another resembled a melting ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you are in luck.
According to the style watchers, the imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow in the footsteps of the “Bomba”, the wide-brimmed straw hat that stars rip off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that sells this hard-wearing hat that has flooded social networks has presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a beach bag made of straw almost as large as the mannequin in a swimsuit that wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the centerpiece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus fashion show at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in stores for next summer. The designer has so marked the minds that it's obvious that there will be demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this trend continued in 2018 with excellent new exam results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and in their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector able to design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries.
If we look at the excellent exam results this year, we find that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade, A.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72% of students obtained the highest score, A, in Mandarin, as did the 72% of students who studied German, the 69% of students who studied French and the 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scottish independent schools support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
From now on, languages as subjects are organized just like science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 UK Employment and Skills Commission survey reveals that 17% of the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
No matter what career choice, a person who speaks a second language will have a real advantage in the future thanks to this lasting competence.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the UK, 75% of them did not have sufficient command of a foreign language to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
Speaking multiple languages, including those in emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on contemporary classical languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the outlook for 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is clear that at present, in a global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country. This must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans watching LeBron James’ debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
We don’t know how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a few limited minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game pre-season program.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump Campaign in West Virginia (YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stops, including in states like Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the confirmation vote for the vacant Supreme Court postponed, Trump seeks to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to raise the issue of the hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed until a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans gain ground ahead of the November elections.
According to Reuters, the president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an essential part of his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of a busy election campaign,” a Trump spokesman told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the meeting tonight, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media.”
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come in to try to revive him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. Team Ready to Fight for Hope as Sunday Singles Approach
After three singles, Saturday afternoon foursomes could well represent what was missing at this Ryder Cup.
The momentum swing movement is an invented sports concept but which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments such as this one.
Where would they put the momentum now?
“They were leading with six points ahead and now four, so it gives us a little bit of wings,” Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a bit windy and have every reason to be encouraged, notably by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can boast of having each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has proved terribly effective from tee to green and sets an example.
The energetic shouts of joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize in the fourth game as he and Thomas were led two downs after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game in the 15th hole, aroused a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team still in the race.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on our game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as Ryder Cup history attests.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four games and is not entitled to error.
Not only were “Moliwood” the only ones not to perform a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the raving crowd designates them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European victory as the sun sets on the National Golf Course.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Morning Fourballs hero Sergio Garcia as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they were never able to come out.
On Sundays, no one is there to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give and the ones they don’t, and how a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a considerable lead over the last day, but this foursome session also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubted, especially at home.
Europe leads 10-6 in final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will take a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 over the United States in Saturday’s four-balls and foursomes.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a distressed Tiger Woods, allowing them to score four points so far.
Determined to keep the title they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by winning 3-1 in the morning fourballs, against a disorderly American team.
The United States showed greater resistance in the foursomes and won two victories, but failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must earn eight points out of 12 on Sunday in the singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, dubbed "Molliwood" after a smashing weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they flat-out beat the pair consisting of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who crawled through Saturday's two games, has shone a few times, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world standings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, in a cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They earned a well-deserved 2-1 win over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, the latter having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, one team has recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, only had to draw to keep their trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they may not recover from a Sunday counterattack.
North Korea says disarmament will “in no case” be done unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the continued sanctions strengthened his mistrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
At the World Atomic Energy Organization’s annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said last year that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures”, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While reiterating North Korea’s well-known criticism of Washington’s opposition to a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, his statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work for a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected demands to ease harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
The U.S. insists that North Korea first proceed with denuclearization and accentuates the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner, even opposing "the declaration of an end to war".
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us plead do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining the sanctions increases our suspicion.”
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted before the United Nations by the U.S. leader earlier this week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the denuclearization side was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Still, Ri’s tone of speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North American territory after “evil” President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the United Nations last year to “totally destroy” North Korea, has been praising the courage with which Kim has applied disarmament measures this year, but added that much remains to be done and that sanctions will not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said no deadline had been set. “It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until complete, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced his “gangster methods.”
At a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “equivalent measures.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim is demanding the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University has put in place a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fights the growing macho trend of studying by consuming caffeine all night.
A professor has noticed that most students at the best university in the world do not know how to take care of themselves
The course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him.
At the end, a student came up to me and said, “Why am I only being told this in my senior year?”
She said no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
First taught this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of health services at the university, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bed.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not instantly change the behavior of students.
However, in our opinion, they have a right to know this information – in the same way that you have a right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride in “having a night off” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having enough and good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even to avoid gaining weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, making them permanently hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and pushed him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar program of study before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students predict an alarm for both bedtime and wake-up times, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal makes Gerrard's men fall
The Rangers took another hard blow on the outside, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disjointed team at Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team hoped to record their first away win since their 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team drifting eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston moved up to third, just behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury from throwing an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, meanwhile, chose the same Livi 11 who snatched a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team choking his opponents on each lap.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored within two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second post.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a penalty after the free kick when he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers took only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a hit from Ovie Ejaria.
If Livi's opening score in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' stopped kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for an ending in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted to the halftime by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the trade almost had an immediate impact when the wingman showed up in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls over long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final moments, but McGregor did well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was battling with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now, a page of our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and the Counter Turns... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: “What is this?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, it's used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
“Through these headphones, we can actually hear the effects of the atoms released into the minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “Say, it sure jumps out there!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
New Cancer Vaccine Allows the Immune System to ‘Discover’ Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Allows the Immune System to ‘Discover’ Cancer Cells and Kill Them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then “detect” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then reinjected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory, so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally reinjecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the protein HER2 “trains causes an increase in several types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, taking immune cells to “teach” them how to target cancer cells, has proven successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Wearing a MAGA cap, Kanye West embarked on a Pro-Trump diatribe after joining the SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was hailed on the set after a wild performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run for election in 2020.
After his third track, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump?
“Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock meant mocking West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter-hour behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a pit," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see him, the gulf?" and said that he would wear his superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions to him.
Try the love.”
His comments attracted at least twice the public's cheers and the SNL members seemed embarrassed, reports Variety. One person on the scene told the magazine, "A deadly silence has fallen on the entire set."
West had been called in to replace last-minute singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West upset a lot of people by singing the song I Love It in a Perrier Bottle Costume.
West received support from TPUSA Conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR KEEPING THE CRUZED."
But Karen Hunter, the show’s host, tweeted that West was simply “true to himself, and that it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes, or by supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary late Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, then the name of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Charged with attempted murder after stabbing at restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday at a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred at Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear in Belfast's court of first instance on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to pretend to be tough cooks to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes “something is wrong” and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of <0x23>MeToo.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, said he was “strongly” keen to address the issue.
“Personally, I deeply believe that we have mistreated masculinity.”
“What lessons have we given to young men who are becoming adults, in relation to the problem that is now being faced?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What do television and the street teach young boys that make them think they have to behave this way to be a man?
I believe this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
Obviously, there is something wrong.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, claiming to have finished with "the battlefields and the horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on,” he says.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie’s family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in some parts of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised, since 2003, universal access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee disclosed senator-related data, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were backed by “far-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It appears that the information leaked included the addresses and phone numbers of the U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by a stranger at Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after all three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a true lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism online, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not question the accuser's motives.
She needs to stay calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the Waters seat in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the relevant law enforcement authorities and agencies” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the culprits are unmasked,” she added, “and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team.”
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, underdog spy
It has now become a tradition to seek the scope of Brexit in any new British film and this seems to apply to this reprise of the action comedy Johnny English, which debuted in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will ironic self-satire on the question of the evidence of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with wide-eyed and rubber-faced eyes, has seen his license renewed for the second time in a confusing context - this name above all indicating that it is a great comedy creation designed for a non-English-speaking cinematic audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charming, possesses a little Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean, and a good dose of the guy who runs a little note in The Fire Trolleys at the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony.
Originally, it also draws inspiration from the traveler and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather insufficient and oddly superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses like 007 and Mission Impossible are themselves confidently composing with comedy.
The humor seems more child-oriented than adult, and, to me, Johnny English's wacky misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's silent film gags in the Bean character.
The perpetually current premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the great dismay of the agents on duty - a small role unfortunately for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that overflows the vase for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the brink of crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to get under the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy being compromised, she will have to get someone out of retirement.
This means disturbing Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic establishment as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: some nice pranks here, because English offers a Rock Academy-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his longtime partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are creating big trouble at Her Majesty's Secret Service, get back into action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the grip of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their odyssey of farcical jokes: under the guise of waiters, they set a sparkling French restaurant on fire; they create chaos by sneaking on Volta’s luxurious sailboat; and English triggers real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house.
All the stops are assured for this last sequence, but despite everything, there are a lot of things for the children in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn’t help but think, as with the other Johnny English films: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will truly value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having developed a plan so that the British can work four days but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow Britons to work four days a week – but get paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while still earning the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic program and plans to orient the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.”
“It won’t be done overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party committed itself to a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party.”
Acting Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour conference to give details on his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power in the hands of "anonymous directors" and "profiteers" in public utility businesses.
The alternate chancellor's plans also provide that current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their full stake as the Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into company boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the private company’s capital to employees, who will pocket up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell “60 Minutes” if the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court has been postponed by at least a week following the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, Scott Pelley, the “60 Minutes” program correspondent, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when those allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
However, Graham’s vote seems engraved in stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she names couldn’t verify it.
This is a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive roster of stars and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival’s true goal, namely to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which first took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a global leader, calling or making any other useful effort to raise awareness about the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clictivism” – a situation in which people really think they make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “shares” from its supporters, who are advocating for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped inspire global leaders to make commitments and adopt policies worth more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or withdrawn.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and performers who are committed to “helping children reach their full potential” while pledging <0xC2><0xA3>35 million in aid to Rwanda to end malnutrition in that country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve mother and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, “What makes you think that it is possible to end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said: “The path to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
U.S. could call on Navy to create ‘blockade’ to curb Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, Washington can “if necessary” call on the US Navy, revealed Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East with the aim of negotiating energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways to remedy this.
“The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,” he added.
Zinke was addressing attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “spokesperson for energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are in fact identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as having “more than one bowstring” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has pledged to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the “inappropriate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Trump says is making the city of Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a September speech in Moscow following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, “I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The position of the United States has generated negative reactions on the part of Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to get involved in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements concluded between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, the director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running in the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider running for president following the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we can vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to the poll by the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe Political Research Center, 58% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other prominent Democrats mentioned for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is feeling right now, what he’s feeling on his way home, I can connect him to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a “taboo subject” and said about his son and other veterans that “they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and air force members, and every other military, has given to the country.”
Dan Bennett, a Wasilla police spokesman, said he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a brief in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against Federal Policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum claims in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined in accordance with the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the amicus curiae said in its memorandum.
The lawyers also argued in the memo that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their countries of origin due to persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in his announcement of the policy.
“Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems—even the most serious—that people face every day around the world.”
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said as she comforted her feverish little boy in Palu, an evacuation center in the empty town.
“At every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, picking up soaked goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake were submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was suffering from a fractured back and shoulders, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told how he felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe,” Haris told The Associated Press, noting that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but after the silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my son.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of “intimidation” through “propaganda ads”
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page advertisement bragging about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in a U.S. newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday discussed the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the November 6 U.S. parliamentary elections, an accusation that China denies.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to meddle in the U.S. election, Trump marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the start of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising into the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“On the other hand, at the Beijing press desk, you will find few protesting voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on China’s troubling economic trajectory, as the media firmly obey the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China has avoided publishing" his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are alienating voters as midterm elections approach because of Kavanaugh's debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said “we can’t go back.”
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favour of an FBI investigation were sufficient to calm the anger of voters.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said last September 28 according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters chanted “November is Coming!” in the Senate corridor as Republicans ruling the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be overwhelming,” said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among suburban voters and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts have suggested the reaction would be vivid if Republicans pushed forward the confirmation.
According to NBC News, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said earlier last week that “It has become a confusing mess for the GOP.”
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh’s appointment, it’s also about how Republicans handled the situation and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, told the newspaper.
Following testimonies from Ford and Kavanaugh, however, Americans seem divided about the credibility of both sides, with a small majority leaning toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll found that 41% of people surveyed believed absolutely or probably Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh likely or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a brand new company that is looking to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s free platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is saved as well as who is authorized to access such or such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt aimed to "dominate the world."
“We have to do it now,” he said of the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or DPL.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time in a single browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility via data”.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not yet in talks with "Facebook and Google" about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely upended in an instant.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a Saturday article on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem with the goal of protecting the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a World War I ecclesiastic decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England ecclesiastic to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on 29 September 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was, however, killed by a sniper four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
Her two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s exploit.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the violent firing of field guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", guided the line before blowing up a field cannon on his own and striking three soldiers of the detachment.
On 4 October 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “a thing that I will never be able to live up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be a part of the show” and added that “the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people.”
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent the whole night watching a well-filled Bellator 206, but you couldn’t see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 matches, six of which were on the main page, and was broadcast live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy to have stayed awake until the early hours of the morning especially for the fight.
A supporter on Twitter described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad joke.”
Speaking about the broadcast, Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications Dave Schwartz said, “Government regulations stipulate that at 6 a.m., this content was not adapted, so they had to switch to children’s shows.”
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Scott Coker, the chairman of Bellator, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, which is Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched over, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee you this won't happen next time.
We’ll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we’ve tried to give more for the fans and we’ve ruined everything.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before he went to high school that “everyone [was] not like me.”
On Lauren Laverne's first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show, he said he talked about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's regular host, Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a shipwrecked man on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, “Even today, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove he was “something,” he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The triple world champion claimed he "didn't expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you live so many things at such a young age” – he took part in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he says he confided that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "all his perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I was only thinking about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012 since he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t say, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he had to die so that I could finally recognize that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I'd dreamed of all my life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired his first song choice - Heather Small's Proud - which had accompanied him in preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 a.m., BST.
A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to straighten up to avoid it being an unfortunate stage.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was ruled out by Captain Jim Furyk of Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time great champion shared his day between the role of supporter and the refinement of his game at the stand in order to remedy his ailments.
He was never the greatest of the leaders, even at the peak of his career. At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the misguided blows.
And as if the course were not dreadful enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12-game singles, make a good start, Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a pat on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him playing two games.
I was expecting more, but that's how it happened and that's how we felt we should proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup games ever.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven defeats, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room.”
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He does more than just play.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the singles of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult course.
The Dane played his first game in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You don’t stop remembering that we led a lot in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but almost,” said Bjorn, after watching the 2018 Rankings win 5-3 at both Friday and yesterday at Golf National to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go ahead and do it tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, which is to try to win this trophy, and that is what we need to stay focused on.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s going on on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never go any further on this point.
Tomorrow, it's a whole different pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it will be the individual performances that will be presented and it will be quite different.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re put to the test to your full ability as a golfer.
That’s the message for the players to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players score better individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both extremes of those last day turns, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing at the end of the “Miracle of Medina”, where Europe snatched victory.
“I remember every word,” he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take that quick start as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should do, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I’ve accompanied this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the entire course,” Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but it won’t be in service until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the all-new frigates of Baden-Württemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the worrying issues that arose after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years outside the home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the relentless delays mean that the forward-thinking warships – which should allow Germany to project its force overseas – will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but German media reported a number of "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship useless in the event of deployment on combat missions.
Software deficiencies were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half the crews of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, which decreases its efficiency and reduces the ability of the Navy to make future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is estimated to weigh twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the price of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared to 2.2 billion initially.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact “short of ships able to deploy.”
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were downgraded but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow bats and sopranos as well as long-eared brown and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional analysis of the sound will determine the frequency of bat screams and the activities of the different species.
A map and habitat report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their territorial behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as prairie creation and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect perches and result in the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-killing papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles on their flight path.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only reserve of Scottish bats at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, manager of the domain, says the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a great place for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
It emphasizes the importance of verifying the presence of bats before proceeding to the maintenance of the properties, because unintentionally destroying a single maternity nest, it can thus cause the death of 400 females and young, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their perches.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations right now.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him “false information” and claimed that people “want to make themselves known” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported last Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram just hours after the allegations were broadcast, Ronaldo, 33, called the information “false information.”
“No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "unacceptable denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy".
Counsel Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in proportion to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape allegedly occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County Courthouse, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him he was a "99% good guy" but that he didn't know what was going on with the "1%" remaining.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that these were consented to.
Mayorga also said she turned herself in to police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently agreed to an amicable settlement because she felt “terrified of reprisals” and feared “of public humiliation.”
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel the settlement because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve under a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK would “forever regret” the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Trade, the UK would “repent forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK told the BBC it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are about what automakers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “tense flow”, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of coins.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
“We need a deal, we want to have the best deal that will, as I said, not only take advantage of the current success, but also seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence, not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to maintain what has turned out to be an excellent set of supply chains.”
While Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be stopped, it warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the Unite union at the factory and who has worked for 24 years in Burnaston, said its members were increasingly worried: “In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
White House says Trump and Rosenstein meeting could still be delayed
According to the White House’s announcement on Sunday, the high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by a week,” while the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser charged with investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump’s collaborators and Russia, and possible obstructions to justice by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumours in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone in order to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday he ran for office in the White House as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we postpone another week given all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press informed.”
The claim would be disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of lectures was not due to an aversion to “demagogic” television reporters, although she said: “I have nothing against the fact that they are amazing the gallery.”
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that “the president participates in more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him”: “We checked the numbers.”
There will always be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to directly question the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it frequently, you’ve seen it well in recent weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Regularly, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are solo press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
On Brexit fears, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish MEP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to lead to decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal.
I understand that this period must be very troubling for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Tennessee State's Mike Organ said Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers' backer, was operated on after suffering a head injury on Saturday during the Vanderbilt Commodores' 31-27 defeat.
Rod Reed, Tennessee's head coach, told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the touch line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touchline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for another examination.
A representative from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had exited the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there was "no clarification as yet on the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student athlete, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duties if they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative regimes
This measure will nullify the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy a property in the UK - the extra money will go to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will be used to strengthen the government’s efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which comes in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13 per cent of new London buildings are purchased by non-UK residents, driving up prices and preventing first-time buyers from gaining a foothold in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country – notably in the capital – have become “ghost towns” because of the high number of foreign buyers who mostly stay outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing large construction companies of keeping real estate prices at a high level by grabbing land without using it, he urged May to give up quotas on affordable housing in an effort to settle the “real estate disgrace” that plagues the UK.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive set of housing reform proposals, including rent control and the elimination of "no fault" evictions.
It also wants to give councils more powers to build new housing.
May said: “Last year, I said that I would dedicate my post as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for non-UK individuals, as well as foreign companies, to buy a home as it is for hard-working UK residents.
For far too many people, the dream of accessing property has become distant and the misery of the homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is delighted to take on the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which is currently in third place in Ligue 1, three points behind the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland’s games at Hampden with my dad and it’s something I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity would only arise if I succeed in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coaches are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he has not hesitated to rank behind such iconic names in such a big club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it belongs undoubtedly to the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably only consider myself a success here if I manage to get the club back there.”
Ross has only three years as a coach, after a period as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa climb up from a relegation to the third division and turned St Mirren, who was on the verge of relegation, into a major championship winner the following season.
Ross feels more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Alloa’s care “was undoubtedly a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really felt that being a coach was better for me than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, I made a good living and I enjoyed some appreciable peaks.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of details to settle each week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is doing very well for me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve ever been in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwave raised revenues for struggling British pubs, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that bar and pubs groups saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, who compiled the data, said: “England’s permanent sunshine and longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup made July follow the June model, where bars had seen a 2.8% increase, except for restaurants, which suffered an even greater shock.
The 1.8% drop in the restaurant sector in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars serving alcoholic beverages are by far the most fashionable, with more points of resemblance than declining restaurants.
Food pubs also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM Recreation and Hospitality Analyst, said: “These results follow the trend seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
No wonder catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a 4.8% decline in annual average sales is particularly painful, in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have been less opportune for food operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will grant a well-deserved respite.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in settlement.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the industry standard.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children – some of whom are just 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Insta” pages
The news has accentuated concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they have a “main” account to show to their parents
One in five children – some of whom are just 11 years old – opens a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported running a cleaned “main” account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who was inciting others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, with half of students recognizing that they have private accounts.
CSM Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this choice as a great opportunity for the sport’s leaders to leverage his vast experience gained internationally over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from his participation on the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 200m and 400m at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Online, an advertisement on the breast pump that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertisement from a company offering a breast pump compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during milking.
To mark the launch of what is called the “world’s first silent breast pump,” Elvie, a consumer technology company, launched a bold ad inspired by a music video to show the freedom its new breast pump offers to breastfeeding women.
In a hay-filled cow barn, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: “Yes, I treat myself, but you don’t see a tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, it’s my breasts, not breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help women milking milk.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “This is understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are caring for their baby?”
Someone else added: “An advertisement so disconnected.”
Others defended the advertisement, for example a woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious".
“I think it’s an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented, “This is a fun advertisement for moms who draw their milk (often at their workplace or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows.’
It is not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they danced with the discreet breast pumps hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, without wires or pipes and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breastmilk extraction and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk pump will provide.
This is not the first time Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Settle Silently in Texas Border Camp
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it more difficult to place children with respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they feared they would compromise their own ability to stay in the country by going to the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their household should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified to Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of respondents or their family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
As a result, we continue to prosecute these people,” said Mr. Albence.
According to the shelters, in order to deal more quickly with the case of children, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to plead their case regarding their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible will be promptly expelled.
According to the speakers and reports that have been presented in recent months by the shelter network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbursts of violence or attempts to flee.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be overlooked because of their size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have difficulty managing.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Mualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would be “treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, with more than 360,000 people dead since 2011 and millions more uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” of both terrorist groups and any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-ravaged country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on site.
Moualem said the conditions were favourable for refugees to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational concerns” that deterred refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition aimed at ending this war is reached.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold in Idlib has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces backed by Russia.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement provided for "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that the military measures will target jihadists, especially Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN representative, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections in Syria.
Mualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the group’s work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution,” and cautioned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers hope, the impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
What would arguably be “the most spectacular finale of a presidency!”
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour odds have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reaches 3.5 million viewers at prime time, is the number one cable TV channel.
"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor," which talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comic author and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about slipping into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She recalls taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike anything that happens on television, Washington’s scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade affair, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when we find ourselves watching for six hours a panel of experts debate how Bob Woodward used “deep know-how” for his book “Fear,” on Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment filled with pride,” Mr. Trump said.
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“If part of what he does feels like he’s watching a reality TV show, it’s because he makes you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s changing teams and daily situational upheavals (fighting with the NFL, congratulating Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode or we're lagging behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees at home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was sitting inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not detach himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember the time when we were animating all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from outside invades the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of Congressional constituencies that allowed two incumbents to compete for the same seat.
The newly restructured suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured by another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps the new 17th District.
The maps were redesigned when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former boroughs were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district kicked off a clash over the financing of election campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory just won last March in a very popular special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
That seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politologists gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then backed down.
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, to which Washington had little opposition.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization leadership.
State Department officials decided to summon the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions have only been imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide it with development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings continued, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, seen as a breakthrough in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now speaking at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show how important the administration is to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. emissaries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their remarks were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying History
The next tile could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice. The public record is now backed up by substantial evidence.
Mueller would also direct his investigation to the question of connivance of Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If control of Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to Congress as he prepares to stand before voters and, perhaps, a peer jury.
These are many “yeses”, and I am not claiming that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will impact the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these cleavages.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses the deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the paper reported that last year he offered to secretly register the president and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we respond to if the FBI’s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial — or if he is confined to the Supreme Court despite sexual assault charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump to account?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my residence as ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table bearing the swastika.
With this legacy, I can’t help but be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienne
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienne on Thursday, while knowing that the victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first appearance of the season until the 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the most of such a result to achieve feats.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," said the 31-year-old striker.
“We went into the game thinking we’d get something and got away with a point.
We might have won in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they did a good result in their last match, however I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
“Last year was really tough, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Let’s hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind us and triumph.”
Women can no longer sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings
Although participants in this survey clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people discussed the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had told their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not doing what it takes to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless you tell them your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor is also able to help you figure out a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a buyback-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover those expenses, or other insurance on your estate - provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the process.
Provide a health care power of attorney that will allow you to appoint a trusted person who will verify your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and will ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Think about the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is going to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place.”
A man was wounded several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home from an evening.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which occurred around 2.30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police issued a call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the toll is expected to rise.
With communications paralyzed, rescue services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, whose population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that runs along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, and particularly of the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times for a century, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunamis were caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes rocked Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone of a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre and is being held on unsecured bond of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, pleading “not guilty, for sure” when his plea was asked, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor offence, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with spousal violence, interference in the report of a crime of spousal violence and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His wife claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are out of order and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck just off the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death sentence for person suspected of terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York assaulter who claimed eight victims — a rare sentence that has not been enforced in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to attack a bicycle lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, cutting off pedestrians and a cyclist on his road last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will need to provide evidence that Saipov “intentionally” murdered the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the assault, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “meticulous preparation and premeditation,” prosecutors said, calling Saipov’s method “odious, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnoncco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York has not demanded the death penalty in prosecutions for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for engaging in acts of conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
Saipov told authorities he was incited to commit the attack after watching Daesh videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the Daesh flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “obviously disappointed” with the decision to prosecute.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his guilty plea and sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to "mobilize the people's army" at a rally at the Conservatives' conference.
The former UK Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested, he should be tasked with negotiating with the EU.
Conservative backbench MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham March that the UK "would have already been freed" if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma May faces in reconciling her deeply divided troops has been underlined by conservatives in favor of staying in the Union who have joined an isolated anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its programme and "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of Chequers.”
He said Mr Farage should have become a partner and been given the burden of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We have not indulged in world wars to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own homeland.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely wrong.”
The conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of the exit, was also present at the march to tell journalists: “I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, this is also the case of our party and our activists who roam the streets and make us elect first and foremost.
Give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to Ms. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians should be brought to “feel the pressure” if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They are trying to deceive Brexit and we are telling them today, “We will not let you get away with it.”
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to put pressure on our political class who are about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the people’s army of this country that allowed us to win Brexit and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, pro-European supporters marched through Birmingham before organising a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved Conservative anti-Brexit banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
His Labour counterpart, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservatives over security issues regarding the party's enforcement at the start of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a real farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider running for president
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future Saturday at a public assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, GOP representative in the states, who was co-chair in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she might face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman at the head of the state.”
Arrest during the shooting death of Sims from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department participated in the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying a man who was featured in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims received a bullet wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries," Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told 247 sports on Saturday.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson admitted that he was on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2m youngster who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 starting last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heads to the world title after team directives allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas took a good start and neared Hamilton on the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to jump into the turmoil at the tail of the pack, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the pits one lap later and ended up behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside at the risk of resisting after a double-defense attempt in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first lap to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a speed finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally reached the pits in lap 44, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a one-two,” Hamilton said.
It was very bad body language
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who pointed out that she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but argued that the events in the Senate showed that people were "nasty, disgusting and dishonest."
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s happening in the Senate these last few days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“When they see the disclosures and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak any information?
Remember his response... did you leak any information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t divulge anything.”
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak information... No, we didn't leak information," he added, thinking about the senator's impression.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford last July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I have not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations, I have not disclosed his story," Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: “I’ll tell you, it was very bad body language.
“Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the pettiness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars cleared Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by scoring a 5-3 return game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before Dwyer gave the Giants back the lead.
François Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, assuring them victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast, after being caught up.
It was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two sides, with the Giants having triumphed in the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan relaunched the home team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt took Cownie's service at 15:16 with a tie.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team got together and Bouchard again equalized with a goal giving a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen place Dundee first in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal midway through the game.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller has died by helping hundreds of people on board an airplane to escape the quake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died by making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the area and large numbers of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his post in the violently shaken tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained on site to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken to learn that,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country’s disaster reduction agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The toll would continue to increase as many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves of up to six meters have ravaged Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after a plane crashed in the lagoon.
The airline that handled the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man is missing after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it was not able to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had come too low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes says.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to slip into the water to the rescue exits of the sinking plane.
l claimed that the flight attendants had panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that sailors working nearby on a dock improvement had also participated in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people on land before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none involved Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its case Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to track the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' house while he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “[lieing] because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers’ death, Tellis removed Chambers’s text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense must begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by imbuing their music with positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The band wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing her after ‘racist’ text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message mistakenly sent by her mother who complained that she was “still a Black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, and equates the prosecution with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she found in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOON A BLACK ONCE AGAIN,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Yet instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her "uncomfortable" gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, explaining that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipina.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day’s work and then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Mauritius is suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six-month home service she was originally hired for, but without a contract.
“I want them to understand, listen, we don’t do that kind of thing,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to end Mauritius' employment, fearing that they could not be able to trust him after harming him.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Calling the trial an “extortion,” Plasco said his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
“Would you chase someone like that?
It’s not a very pleasant thing to do,” added the business banker.
While the case is still pending, the public opinion court did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington Editors Worried Readers Would Not Identify With a Talking Bear, Reveals New Letter
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of this letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s a lot of fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a teddy bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication had had a "sweet-bitter" flavor after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” and adds that his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a fairly calm man, and he wasn’t a pretentious man,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who does something: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect her to get out," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors had given her to maintain her heart rate were slowly depleting and coming out of her system.
She had died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the ordeal she was going through.
“No one knew about it,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women drop postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted, on a Welsh bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up any room.”
However, he gave up his job before dying, as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid that there's a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the maps "to let people know that there are people you can go see and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down, depressed or whatever,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
It was at its lowest on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their gifts, it had no eye contact with them or anything.”
She said her death had been a huge trauma for them, but they have to make it through: “It’s heartbreaking for the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for — a time-limited investigation, limited in scope — we might be able to bring some unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “collapse” into a partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans score poorly, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to split the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of deserters 'fall' under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions took place last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tightening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations that had so far remained pending.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly speaking, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we will be the first to operate unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit on Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, they would have called her "hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times nearly screamed and choked as he talked about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations about him a “grotesque and coordinated assassination” organized by disappointed Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she said Kavanaugh’s testimony showed he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, since he showed he was against the Democrats.
“I think he’s discrediting himself with these statements and the way he’s attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to oust Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but he’s also unfit to sit on the court where he’s currently sitting,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh avoided the issue of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and it can't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, do you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was a cadre somewhere, who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to say to the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried, ‘You can think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my first job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying with inexpressible rage, was that I was seized by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman — a cold manager who had always scared me a little — who dragged me down a staircase.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado Democrat, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a carefully thought-out decision,” she laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they were missing was one more person.
Someone had called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was very advanced, she had lagged behind in fundraising, and so vowed that she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters, who usually gave $1,000 to men, intended to give her only $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions — the gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sexism — that she felt stunned.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled about the press’ reaction to her.
“You would have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my gravestone.
“She cried?”
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first waves of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs affecting items worth US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing has retaliated in kind, recently hitting tariffs of 5-10% on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China is committed to matching the United States, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to falter anytime soon.
To push back Washington is to give in to demands, but to give in publicly before the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions conducive to an economic slowdown in either country is actually much more dangerous than what observers have acknowledged before,” Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the refugees to return voluntarily and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the 14.5-point mark to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who found himself in trouble for most of the tournament, plunged his start into the water in the 16th hole in par-3, giving his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of four players to have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5-4 by the European team's worst-placed player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, dropped 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the all-time European champion with a total of 25.5 career points.
“In general, I don’t cry, but today it’s louder than me.
It was a turbulent year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I’m so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help them,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods 2-1 in the singles last Sunday.
“I feel an incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-tier golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We've given up.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we’re going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We have to bow.
We were overwhelmed.”
Red Tide Info Point: Decreasing concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay region.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - which raises concerns about declining concentrations.
The Red Tide covers approximately 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from north of Pinellas to south of Lee County.
There are islands about 16 km (10 miles) off Hillsborough County, but in fewer sites than last week.
Red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations on the Sarasota County floor or offshore, medium concentrations in Charlotte County or offshore, high concentrations in Charlotte County or offshore, and low concentrations in the broader Collier County and offshore.
Respiratory irritation persists in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation was reported in Northwest Florida during the past week.
