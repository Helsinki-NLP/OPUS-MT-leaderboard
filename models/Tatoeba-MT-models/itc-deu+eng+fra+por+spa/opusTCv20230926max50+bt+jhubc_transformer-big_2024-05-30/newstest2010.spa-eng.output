Barack Obama will be the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth American president in history.
The diploma, medal and check of 1.4 million dollars will be awarded, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the committee that, in October, elected him from among 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple has scheduled a meeting with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive him, although the third to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will be talking about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the dispatch of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million Czech kronor).
It proposes to donate them for charitable purposes, but has not yet decided to which organization in particular.
During their full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the start had a rather reserved attitude towards the award.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he didn’t deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents “a challenge to take action.”
Nature Advocate Accused of Blackmail
Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the civic association Spole<0xC4><0x8D>nost ochránc<0xC5><0xAF> p<0xC5><0x99>írody Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice (Society of Nature Defenders Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice) of blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some building licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded money from investors for his own benefit, said Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Nature Defenders Society is Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently detained and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno does not like containers too much to separate the garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate the beverage packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia can find containers for separating garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno the garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the city councils are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of garbage, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing a PET bottle in the middle into the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially it requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in the Moravské nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Let Mr. Onderka and his companions not be angry with me, but that seems too little to me.
It goes without saying that elsewhere it is also not easy to separate garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
By Vagancy
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the trash was already overflowing from the container.
It’s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy from the city the extra-league hockey, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am happy to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is indeed the worst of the entire Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj region.
The budget of "Paroubek" took money from rents and sickness benefits
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But not for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt all those who govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they relied on the government to later borrow for sensitive expenses, rent, or sickness benefits. "That only means postponing problems for the future, is laying mines," says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, someday, you have to return the money.
The state does not have many options to get money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or state operating expenses, it has to increase taxes.
To everyone the left added now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, your children too.
People don't have to worry about rents or sick benefits, they'll get them. 1.8 billion of these accounts disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in the public debt; next year there will be no shortage of only 163 billion in the treasury, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s effort, debt will continue to rise alongside interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity benefits, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year will also be missing five billion to finish the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The best you can do is keep them, which is also not free.
That means delaying or stopping the 30 large buildings; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also at risk, Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka warns.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the decrease of funds: it will get money from the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bundle.
Last year <0xC4><0x8C>EZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year the dividends are paid ecological damages, serve to complete the account for the rents or serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of the rents.
Moreover, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers does not end here.
Nearly three billion was obtained from the budget to grant various compensations to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
Afterwards, the Minister will have to save money inside the spring or, in the worst case, grab hold of the government budget reserve.
There is also a $100 million shortfall for the State fund, which is worth $2 billion and has already been launched, and which should allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
At the touch of a key, they move in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They will be able to switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be launched in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a RAM of 128 MB, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new mobile phone technology is at its peak.
VMware is cooperating with European and U.S. carriers to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
It is not only the ski lift maintainers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e who are concerned about the snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow means that people do not book ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at deals, check prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas there will be snow or mud," said Spindl.Info maintainer Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n a New Year's Eve according to their expectations, should not hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, may try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n mostly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell out quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what we are most interested in is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some last-minute holiday stays," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer free places.
They sell very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is hurt by the lack of snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year on the mountain without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will be sold out as well,” says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou; last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year’s Eve stays are already occupied at the Omnia Hotel, near the central car park in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are at approximately sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, for the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will pass the craving for snow waiting.
On Thursday the temperatures should drop and, if there is rain, in the mountains it should snow.
But then temperatures will rise again, reported Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent pupil repeats in the Afghan issue the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the most foolish.
When it finally revealed its long-awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only does the same text use the phrase “as in Iraq” several times, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of the January 2007 Bush statement for his own statement: “A new path forward.”
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized it as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, proved that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today nothing is said about Iraq in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, however objectively he left his successor in a much more favourable initial situation than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will repeat itself.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn’t think of anything better, so at least he fooled the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is being fulfilled.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a Potemkin people. After it will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to the confusing relations, further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is “capable of action,” a minimum goal of the whole operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy clashes with his voluntarism.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon", will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, fixing the date of the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what is the relationship between the security of Germany or Italy and the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years to go before the presidential election and that is why there is still a long way to go to find another strategy, if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, shares may be withdrawn if they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to link the bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it must take, said former JPMorgan investor Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $ 20 billion.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at one time, with a tax of fifty percent, bonuses for bankers exceeding 25,000 pounds (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record number, were awarded this year's Nobel Prizes in specialized categories and literature by King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was also among the winners.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The latest prize, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was awarded to Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each laureate collected the diploma, Nobel medal and certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 25 million Czech kronor).
In the event that there are several winners in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize was presented to U.S. President Barack Obama in Oslo, Norway, this afternoon.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps even Janota’s stay in the cabinet, are supposed to be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
President Radim Ochvat's spokesman said the meeting was about to take place.
On his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
Under the budget law, ready to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The House of Representatives, however, on Wednesday approved left-wing proposals for transfers of funds and increased money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, since they covertly increase the budget deficit.
There was a serious internal political conflict between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, and because of this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet began to be controversial, the form of which was agreed in the spring by the SDG, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Party of the Greens.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of savings measures imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can rely on a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
SDG leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
SDG Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, SDGs and the Greens evidently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences."
The head of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by former Topolánek government. It will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were happy too.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's New Movie, Played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But rarely did he represent someone who is still alive and, for many people, is as important as Man.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong to the global extent to the outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela’s story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal but to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela’s hand.
I found that by shaking your hand, I get your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
For me it is important to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when he finally met Pienaar for the first time at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "I look a lot taller in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety magazine film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
Russia's defence ministry said on Tuesday it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near its border with Norway.
The "Bulava"-type missile, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in missile testing has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, no problems occurred at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That’s why it’s likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed “Bulava.”
The Norwegians alike from the start did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by stating that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines were immediately broken down in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely error-free, according to the management of the Ministry of Defense only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent fills the generals with optimism and that is why they continue to claim that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed at the age of 51 an annual contract with CSKA Moscow
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practices constantly and is committed to helping the team.
We just need to settle some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice courts, he will become the longest-running professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, for the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The greatest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and in the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing for Detroit he won twice the Stanley Cup.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hall of Glory.
Hyundai complied with the requirements of the unions. It will cancel all supplementary work
The management of the car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the unions declared the emergency by strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions on another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will work in two shifts, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
According to the server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who work Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company decided to change the way it motivated its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, that is, extend the Christmas holidays in one day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k mentioned.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive money for travel and meals.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k mentioned.
The employees of the auto factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and trade unionists is due to take place on Monday morning.
The head of the unions Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they commit to meeting the requirements and signing the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the auto factory worsened last week when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over frequent overtime.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
Trade unionists in their statement of Monday’s strike emergency also demanded that none of the employees, who interrupted manufacturing last Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, the unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial production began last November.
As of last September, it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'weakened' HIV viruses
Team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs are already available.
AIDS cannot be cured so far.
However, patients’ lives will be significantly prolonged thanks to a mix of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarborans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way different from all the drugs used today, and so they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus’s albumin.
The metallocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, HIV virus fractionation does not occur and mature, infectious corpuscles of the virus would not be created.
If we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was carried out on test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metallocarborans interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, the head of the laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Genetics.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDG chief Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is “scary” and Prime Minister Jan Fischer’s government should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The SDG statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say there is time for analysis.
SDG Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, SDG and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy towards the public deficit problem is completely different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amending proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the SDG proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
ODS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the government’s wish, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign if the amending proposals were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>eská televise Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He pointed out, he is thinking about staying in the show.
The reason is his disillusionment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as in the government have nothing to do with the nominees for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, if the House passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those referring to sickness subsidies, rents, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the SDG are not to blame
It is the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the SDG have done nothing wrong, Topolánek underlined in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the positions of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle to the height of the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, to rely on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I haven’t thought about that, when the time comes, I’ll take care of it,” Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by SDG members, told reporters in the House of Representatives.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer went to a European Council meeting in Brussels.
SDGs surrendered at the request of the Prime Minister
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed, that SDGs in the House of Representatives on Wednesday would likely vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask SDG deputies to allow acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he reacted to the question, if SDG does not worry about the absence of the party head in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
Upon resigning from office, he knew that in the following months it was mainly about the Bolshevism of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new schedule of trains of <0xC4><0x8C>D will circulate fewer trains for almost the same rates
<0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total traffic extension will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule takes effect.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will win for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, dráhy for this line will add a pendulum carriage.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not circulate again in Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice there will be fewer fast trains, direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by drahy is in the region of Hradec Králové, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route will also be cancelled and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to only a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
From December 13, travelers will not return to Bratislava in Pendolino.
This year’s regional rail bill: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, the same as this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local dráhy trains they have a new ten-year contract, until now the contract was always one year.
Drahy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why the prices of a large majority of the tickets did not increase.
Changes will occur only on <0xC4><0x8C>D Net one-day tickets and on cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travelers without a customer card, the <0xC4><0x8C>D Net price will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance, until now there was the single price of 160 kroner for trips between any two regional cities.
Filipino armed continue to detain more than 50 people, children released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several elementary school pupils and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only about 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
They say that approximately 19 armed men use the hostages as a live shield in the escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, police previously pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, whose cause was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in Maguindanao province it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor’s election, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, on Tuesday they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA’s story concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), which captures a part of the biography of the former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela, will be released in American cinemas.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the leading role.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on 18. July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
There are great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa the preparations for the world championship in football culminate. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to – as they say – get his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can remember Mandela’s character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the freely translated title In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years apart. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also stars in the costume of the South African national rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA won the world cup at the time.
By getting into the grass in the suit, which at RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won big ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship will perhaps help people come together and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain, told LN in an interview recently.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns
The fire caught a <0xC4><0x8C>eps transformer in a switch box near the V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov village in Lounsko in the morning.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, the spokesman for the firefighters of the <0xC3><0x9A>stí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Firefighters previously wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but later changed their minds and the fire is being extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguisher material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandatová, the spokeswoman of the company, the breakdown does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, enumerating it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatová, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of <0xC4><0x8C>eps’ activity nothing similar happened, breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ company for the northern Czech Republic, the electricity supplies were not cut, and the fire of the electrical substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps p<0xC5><0xAF>sobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, the electric conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, also maintains the electrical conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a complaint for slander to three hetmans of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Student Agency owner Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today will file a slander complaint against three social democratic hetmans.
These are Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj region, Radko Martinek from Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> kraj and the Olomouck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj hetman Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura mentioned it in Twenty minutes on Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The demand has to do with the company’s effort, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are “taking the raisins from the cake,” yet we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim, that we are more expensive than <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander towards the Student Agency society, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
At the same time he mentioned having the evidence from all the regions. According to him, they have not taken the necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers this complaint to be the continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally, I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region, and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose, and it will be clear this time as well, that Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and lying arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek mentioned.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week, that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, whose aim would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started the campaign after the regions agreed with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion kroner did not call a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura claims to have been threatened by a <0xC4><0x8C>SSD deputy, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave him, we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know, what kind of gentleman he is, I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál today.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual habits.
As the first vaccine, it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also already clear about the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccinations for children born in August
From January onwards, children born on or after August 2 of last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth months of a child's age.
Last year, one-quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
The parents however paid for a dose 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Generally, experts estimate that insurance companies will spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns annually on vaccines.
However, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state has spent about 500,000 children annually on all vaccinations.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and sepsis.
According to hospital research, 28 children under 10 years of age die from pneumococcal infections in our country every year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, pneumococcal vaccine coverage in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be compulsory?
However, at the same time there are opinions, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by the insurance companies and volunteer.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, said Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Their association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we have to take now, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this time we do not think at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Voluntary Vaccination Has Its Disadvantages, Doctors Say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná spole<0xC4><0x8D>nost praktick<0xC3><0xBD>ch d<0xC4><0x9B>tsk<0xC3><0xBD>ch léka<0xC5><0x99><0xC5><0xAF> Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges, that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
“In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer,” Cabrnochová says.
Experts expect that as of next year, more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies be vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "take money out of health insurance."
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid for by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a remarkable amount.
It won’t be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "the theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at $20 million from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 frames into his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta son, 52, told police that his father had ordered him “to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse.”
The agency said Frazetta father denied granting such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increases in Budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
The unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished by a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems.”
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which says this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, as of April 2011
The economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on banker bonds
The 1 point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax exemptions for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110.
Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 involved “difficult decisions,” but insisted that 60% of the supplementary tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending cuts were a “grain of sand in the desert” compared to what was needed.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour party ' s forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit will be reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while the borrowing order would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion above previously estimated.
"Opportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new ad campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party’s “debt crisis,” said the <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion loan application projection for the next six years was unsustainable.
The ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, dodging "cynically" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They haven't included anything significant about what they will do," said the Finance Ministry's shadow minister, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it and they've wasted it."
“All important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals that would seek further short-term deficit reduction.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised from tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sand castles.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcements, such as the aforementioned rise in inflation of some disability subsidies next April, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to allegations of election maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided with the most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the figures from the Finance Minister implied substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“This is really postponing the pain for later,” director Robert Chote said.
"All major announcements will come after the election, whoever wins," said Roger Bootle, an economic consultant for Deloitte accountants.
"This has been the false pre-budget report. Markets are realizing this."
FBI Investigates ‘American Arrests in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
“If they are American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been detained and in what kind of circumstances they are being detained,” spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing,” the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already in the sights of the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported, but said the U.S. had to “work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people.”
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian ‘abuse’
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been just as deficient, according to a report by the campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details “models of abuse” of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man cited in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said that such criticism has a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been sentenced, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC’s correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak’s detention center.
But since then, authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the account of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who said he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election result.
"They often hit me in the face" according to his words.
“They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted there had been abuse.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who said he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate the unrest of post-election and the government’s response, but said the bodies’ mandate and powers were confusing and the parliamentary committee’s inquiries had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
Over 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, in front of a 100-metre-long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
You see below a beautiful view of the glittering city lights.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent."
The prizes were awarded for the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailedly argued study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France’s 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them of renown, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation seeks to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are unable to fully disseminate this argument.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks Muslim values and French secularism might be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives “an adjustment of values”.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most desolate landscape
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transportation and fishing have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a consequence.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who proved their worth by confronting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo precincts are still generally one-millionth of the area of a wild adult's range. The climate is almost never adequate: a Singapore-resident polar bear turned green by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters on helicopters and Eskimo Indians on snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a dazzling look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It is not for lack of effort.
The pioneering voyages of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave first indications about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines drew a map of the moving ice cords that circulate beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of probes mounted on icebergs are a useful supplement, but resilient individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the affluent system within the Arctic ice, formed by jets of saline water that compress as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice recedes, which is thought to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns on Arlington tombs
De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
“In a few months, from where they’re shipping us, these could be us,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place wreaths on the tombs of veterans in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, initiated the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older tombs from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War because they don’t get as many visits as the new tombs, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and couples held hands as they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud names carved on the stones, while others leaned over to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone to remember it."
Cuban Officials Arrest U.S. Government Contractor
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on Dec. 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything deemed “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a budding blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has applied on several occasions for permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor could likely spark tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a “slow-paced” approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for texting, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign hotel visitors, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes like drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as handing out free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program at Human Rights Watch, which recently published a hard-hitting report on freedoms in Cuba, called “Nuevo Castro, same Cuba,” a reference to Raúl Castro’s position as the country’s leader, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and jailed in one day.
He said that any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel plot to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday neutralized the suspected mastermind of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who roam the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the north-west, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not mute and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps, when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who is trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, American intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people within al Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, not letting in those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is looking with special attention at aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge appeal, because of their potential to gain access to American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they admit to, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts on their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate 'action'
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets demanding that negotiators working at the city’s Bella Convention Center take bolder climate action.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number to be closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that said “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish that declared, “the Earth says “enough is enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said Peru’s travels, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country must deal with because of the impacts of climate change that are already happening.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mostly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists in sports masks and black clothing placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started out as flares, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not appear to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
Asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “I really wasn’t aware of the situation.”
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He pointed out that it was up to the perspective of each one to define whether the march was being detrimental or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Data from a test reveal persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal gradebook on math performance was very good news for the public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best-performing systems, the gradebook showed that fourth- and eighth-graders took strides at a faster pace over the past two years, compared to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains engraved in the recent figures from the National Educational Progress Assessment is the persistent performance gap between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white fourth-grade students in D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping by a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year span, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between black and white fourth graders in 2003, when the first ENPE was released in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by the children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely decreased to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by catering to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit advocating for educational equity in the District.
I’m not jumping for a two- or three-point difference, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By Accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elemental.
Brown, a staunch critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the test scores is that the city’s high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what is worrying is that we are not devoting the time and energy necessary for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at upper- and middle-school students who have not mastered the fundamentals of early reading in their school years and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics, a math curriculum from kindergarten through sixth grade that emphasizes games and real-life experiences, was introduced to the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here’s a sort of gritty dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important timeline.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, are confident that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element in closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with self-employed schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year on a 185-day year, which she sees as an "indicator" to seek a larger increase in the next agreement.
Making Higher Education a Part of More Futures
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resentment.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the group’s other eighth-graders explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic prospective students.
Yes! This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Wow, really?” he thoughtfully said, as the guide talked about the school’s low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh the children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you’re going to college.
The question is to which.
While there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in their teens, there are also hundreds of thousands who access the college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second-generation" Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze the highest-performing say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to fix it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to run college readiness programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry has reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a leading role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies drifted away having bid on only two of the 10 sites auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached deals for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military withdrew, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest crude reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were at a disadvantage in some cases because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they don’t respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have forged ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese state-owned National Petroleum Corporation offered more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major fields.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological power, said Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will keep up with its competitors and deliver on its commitments to Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit proposals made bids that were then confronted with the barrel subsidy the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each site.
Al Qaeda's top planner has apparently been murdered in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile strike on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified, CIA-operated aircraft inside Pakistan’s illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, heading for the Afghan border, when the car received the impact, said an official from Pakistan’s civil intelligence agency, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the “totally shattered bodies.”
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al Qaeda military planner, who directed the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was dedicated to conspiracy around the world, said a senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
It had strategic guidance from al Qaeda’s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had quickly ascended the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second al-Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led drone strikes has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a recount by The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit.
The decline is perhaps due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
U.N. envoy to Kabul to resign
The U.N.'s top envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would resign in March, ending a tumultuous term that was hurt by accusations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's U.N.-backed presidential election.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase but is concerned that the U.S. schedule for the military withdrawal that begins in 18 months will push other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who would collaborate with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun looking for a replacement, according to U.N. officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test by his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering up evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide denied the indictments, but said Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, "certainly harmed the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed appointing a high civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, which lend themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermine his ability to attract talent.
So much so that UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
This is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran to face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose “significant additional sanctions” against Iran over its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population at large.
He argued that a “package of incentives and disincentives” would be needed, “to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons”, because “their people will suffer enormously” from the sanctions.
In a statement on Friday, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the directions of the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, he said he would re-negotiate on restricting his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of his enriched uranium reserve in exchange for the desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from the tentative agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian command is divided over whether to commit to the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran’s toughening with the international community on some proposals they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including pursuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unfounded and baseless allegations" by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities, and said it was willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq’s oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delays in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates’ words to Massoud Barzani, the president of Kurdistan’s regional government: “We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that sermonized them on the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city’s low birthrate and ageing population, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only to one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled single children, affectionately nicknamed “little emperors,” a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
Demographic UN, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is forecast to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly cultured populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people 60 and older accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate a future labor shortage.”
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief.
Written in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in imposing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 attenuated many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute for Demographic Research, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost in the evening, the signs that ordered families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide brochures under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in couples seeking a second child after the campaign’s launch, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to only reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give their best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see single-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the HR manager, said she wants a single child because she was too: “We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two middle-class careers that reduce the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents’ struggle during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and they don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, “they have to remodel their apartment,” and the strategic one “has to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycares when the child is 9 months old.”
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference, hitherto characterized by defiant stances and mutual recriminations, garnered renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that forecasts ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Developed by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summed up a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what top UN climate official Yvo de Boer described as “the big picture.”
It shows the profiles for a possible deal, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce theirs over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday featured the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated conversations last week.
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from parts of major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, lamenting that the text did not do enough to ensure the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense,” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing off on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the world’s twenty-four most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it’s not surprising that major powers are arguing about who should pay for curbing greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive looking to contain the big issuers responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change adviser for Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say the talks will yield at most a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a preliminary 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before heads of government come to a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister Jairam Ramesh, descended from the planes and rushed to the Bella Center corridors, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delineate the claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute mess of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center every day, the activists who play the guitar present night shows mocking the countries they say are being sold, and passing preliminary proposals from hand to hand instead of via email), poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global Conservation International policy.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train 225 km/h from Britain redefines that feeling Monday
At 5.13 on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure marking a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h when it lightning-fastly passes from Ashford, Kent, to London’s St Panrcas station, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected secluded areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and switching from planes and cars to railroads would reduce national coal emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still slow Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on Dec. 30, the Times reported.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Penins to Manchester and Scotland, and another heading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
“It looks like this will be the most beneficial option,” said one railroad member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support trains 400 meters long, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the space constraints of the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to suit the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
Initially, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines on existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a change from aircraft to trains, a benchmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers Face Mortgage for a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orange Tree from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built in his constituency house.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived “on rations,” raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-framed extension at his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the extra interest, adding up to hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the requests at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan said the requests "could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Nearby homes have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange tree".
Neighbors described it as “a greenhouse for entertainment.”
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase, during a recent investigation by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges into his previous mortgage arrangements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of breaking the rules after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 from his London property to the house of his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in mortgage interest, as of March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the whole increase was going to finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The BRE’s standard variable mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, the rate it is now.
The most recent document issued by House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as House opposition chairman in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive "rationally" after the spending scandal.
“Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like shit.”
He stated: “I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t.”
The deputy, a millionaire by his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a pound-shaped hole in Mr. Duncan’s lawn as a protest, after it was revealed that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, approved both by the salary office and subsequently by Legg."
He added: “It’s not about circumventing and offending or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and all.
It couldn’t be any clearer or simpler.”
Come those who have faith, to see the Advent calendar of the Brighton Beach Palapa
The palapas of Brighton have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each day of December, using carols as their theme.
The event started on December 1st, with guests who could see the last palapa from 5.30pm to 6.30pm every day, with stuffed pastries and punch served for free.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman of the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the palapa began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to prove and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested on Saturday in demand of an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
About 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, paraded through the icy Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change is expected to reach by Friday, which would enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to making the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, smashed windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, they are especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized in the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took to the Bella Center, seat of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was erected to welcome the invited speakers, and the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelit vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with sky-blue raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the Friends of the Earth call to form “blue tides” for “justice and climate.”
Today we took to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: there’s time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are drying rivers, watercourses through which you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded dressed in red and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed demanding to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Abkhazian separatist elected president, Georgia denounces 'fraud'
Abkhazia, Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president on Saturday; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud."
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Elections closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced Saturday night to Sunday.
The five running candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting.
This election is a farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended in several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large planks show Bagapch next to the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate Moscow’s support, and very particularly, the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that his country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes to Russia control of the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets around the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
About 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched in the afternoon amid the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, seeking an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was erected to welcome the invited speakers, and the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelit vigil.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, smashed windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars set fire near an occupied house during incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to police.
We did not take our eyes off the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with sky-blue raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the Friends of the Earth call to form “blue tides” for “justice and climate.”
Today we took to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told AFP he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
Oxfam along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands that are highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated dressed in red and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed demanding action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview to be broadcast in the Informative Sunday (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would come "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all high school students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "enough with the hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be sub-branches of C, he goes on to underscore: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged at having eliminated history and geography in second of high school in the technological schools".
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that about seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in second grade of high school C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that there is "no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the C-secondary program.
Luc Chatel also defended teacher training reform, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which sacrifices, according to them, the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will take an admission test that will target their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will do internships in real conditions during the year of M2, after which they will be a first year in front of the classroom as internship teachers.
If you do all the proposed practices prior to the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Normal Higher School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that was accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Normal Higher School of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the "Ernest" conference, a day consisting of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that appeals to people and convey to them the desire to know more, explained during the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called just as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We selected about twenty participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific record."
Videos filmed during those lectures will be online on the school’s website starting Dec. 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delayed payments: disgust among prison guards, expected to take action
Prison guards unions on Friday called for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the holidays, bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers’ Force (2nd Guards union) asked off-duty personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “block them” to denounce the theft of their assets.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", as it is "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), "convenes the general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury".
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased greatly in 2009 and not all were counted, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellery reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of guards guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous bonuses for functions and for objectives, and who "always blame the budgetary demands", deplored Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille said indignantly, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions increase without taking more personnel, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, not all regions are the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not as expected, said the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes “better gifts” than he gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television host, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the holidays in their prestigious new residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be of the departure.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: “No way, last year I gave you nice gifts,” she said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering humorously pointing to the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you that?”
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a bicycle with two speeds, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture in line against the wall, instead of accommodating it around the home, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Claims He's Induced Coma
Johnny Hallyday was reinstated in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" stemming from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reinstated Wednesday night at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital where doctors checked "injuries arising from the operation" of a herniated disc performed in Paris on November 26, his press service in that same city said, indicating that those injuries "needed a restorative operation."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquility by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about his condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that “according to some sources” no cannulas were introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection stemming from Delajoux's intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad time", but said he was not making "any problem" because the rocker is "a fighter".
He called me just before he traveled to L.A., and I told him it was silly to fly twelve hours after such an operation, it’s not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure the audience that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken with Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on from a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been overreported. Fans and journalists noticed the musician’s difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: first Bousquet title in his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Long-Pool Championships, won an international title on Thursday at a distance he feels particular affection for, 50 m free, during Euro 2009 in short pool in Istanbul.
In the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimsuits were allowed for the last time, only three world records were broken when in fact many more were expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A pity for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m freestyle, mark he owns in long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen swim distances, in 50 m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world record (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, nearly all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that will be banned from January 1.
These swimsuits, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in the 400m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he prevailed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give myself completely into this race.
I knew I wasn’t going to be able to break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S. sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, the Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel, 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century AD, and its price had been estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble “representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is an unusual piece, since in the world there are only four or five,” Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby’s, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bidden by buyers, without a doubt, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For nearly 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her private Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
In reviewing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras Aborts Zelaya’s Departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that conditions were not given to transfer to its territory the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied the safe-conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation with President Zelaya in the evening, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya back to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
In order to grant him a safe-conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "renounce" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to arrive in Mexico as a guest head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign (...), they wanted me to present my resignation," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been five months in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, refugee in the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a safe-conduct request, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Zelaya responded in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
The Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the coup government’s position.
That reflects the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the Justice for the crime of “high treason”, according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted en masse against Zelaya’s return to power until he ended his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, the US trade balance figures are a faithful witness of the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the definitive figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, of technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We get good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the glass half full."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the U.S. trade balance figures, “which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly goods exports, reflecting the growth of major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were submitted.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond was 4.492% against 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power booing the "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
About forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted in the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, said an AFP journalist.
Death to the Yankees!, “Mercenaries!”, “The street belongs to the revolutionaries!”, “Long live Fidel and Raúl!”, the militants of power raised their fist to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by officers dressed in civilian clothes who came to "protect" them.
The day before, a similar demonstration was unleashed against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for international human rights day, were detained by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, an AFP journalist reported.
The agents forcibly climbed into the vehicles dissidents who were booed by supporters of the government, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call opponents "mercenaries" or "agents" for their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rare in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of government militants against the “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An imbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the center of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Highs of the Seine) on Thursday at the time of greatest influx of the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly beat an elderly man with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to an official from the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was hospitalized "in shock," a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, had escaped by the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently at random, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a man in his thirties, and another in his forties seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives crossed on his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alien, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They failed because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a bartender at a nearby bar.
A crowd threw themselves at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, at No. 61, two municipal officers, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were punched, according to police testimonies.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops can be found.
Some people came to tell me that there was a man injured in the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor, and when I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very serious wound in his abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person arrived, about 35 years old, with knife wounds.
National police officers detained the man without identity documents.
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his interim detention, he did not speak.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of internment in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to dominate him at the Clichy police station to which he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "every deranged person of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of the action".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for dismissal of case
The lawyer of French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has again called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), to dismiss the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of "The Pianist," filed a complaint before three judges of the Second District Appeals Chamber of California about serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that the charges are dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "resulted chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since then) would have spoken with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before issuing sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But eventually Wells declared at the end of September "to have lied" to the documentary's author.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, namely that no serious dismissal of the charges could be assessed until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sexual relations" with a girl under 13.
Since then, he has never set foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “has to be here to appear at the hearing.”
With this case, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing,” Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "requests a favor from the court, although he despises its authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce their sentence, also stressed “that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee.”
Hummel was not the only one asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
He argues that his client can no longer be harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on Sept. 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest at his cabin in Gstaad, awaiting eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed aimlessly on Friday, in a market that is debating between indicators better than those expected in the United States and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technology component, lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is becoming smaller and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped improve market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery,” summarized Charles Schwab’s analysts.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence recovered visibly in December, 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary index estimate.
However, the indexes were slowed by a new rise in the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which "leads down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond was 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond was 4.497% against 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are on the final straight to fulfill their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of one billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second year in a row in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportswoman or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real uproar.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw so many things and I had so many experiences,” Miss Sierra Leone said in amazement.
This event, which is held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I can't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take away the breath".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the candidates for Miss World concentrate on the contest.
India’s Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declares Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, in a swimsuit.
Chinese host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa has proven to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that are hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional event, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Unusual for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday 'very positive', says son David
News of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Daddy is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told reporters as he got off the plane that was bringing him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son said he would be transferred "as soon as possible" to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from a herniated disc operation on Nov. 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in an induced coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been submitted to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection, a sequel to a herniated disc operation on Nov. 26 in Paris.
The singer was once again operated on Wednesday night due to serious injuries from the previous operation.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school act, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The head of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on Nov. 26 at the international private clinic at Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly with the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem making the trip, as I had twice operated on a herniated disc, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he said the singer had apparently left "without a cannula, with nothing" after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, he also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed following a brain hemorrhage.
This is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the justice on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and scam.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from advisable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered into a parenthesis.
Undoubtedly, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems very risky, said Camus.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the acronym of the former giscardista party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, under pain of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, as he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having extended his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of its management, it received the help of the deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy inviting them to renounce the acronym and to transfer the rights of ownership of the brand, under penalty of legal action.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the signatories of the letter maintain.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office which requires the NC to immediately remove the mention of the name of the UDF from all media, as well as from (its) website.
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of (the) mark to the legitimate rightholders".
Failure to do so will result in an appeal to justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they point out that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Center has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
Take advantage of the scandalous and fraudulent lack of registration of the acronym UDF to make it on your own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the strategy of the NC: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you have no right."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to prosecute the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of the weak state of the octogenarian to rob her of a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered states of weakness and during what periods.
I think he'll take it.
“I’m going to talk to her,” Mrs. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said as he left the hearing.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
The expert report will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only child has filed criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, as the court examined the origin of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ arguments sometimes resulted in a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters that her client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again.”
For its part, the Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to make way for her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before the courts, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place," prosecutor Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney said.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule upon Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers’s admissibility after the trial.
Management Revolution or the End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of employees adhering to "values" determined from above as before it was a question of imposing on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to the factors of customer preference is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) “requires that all parties involved ... have a proactive conduct and a forward-looking vision”; it needs on the part of employees a commitment that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we called for a management revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative usefulness
Will internal opinion polls, such as the Orange employee questionnaire, incite the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology mechanistically.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behaviorist theory that the American “neurosciences” recently revived, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the “commands” (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management posture, unsuited to today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies implies adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating in all reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make part of their dreams, ambitions and projects come true.
Today, only studies from Motivational Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of mobilisation factors, business managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their “social performance” and relocate human resource management “on the spot”.
In this way, they create a favourable terrain for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo Speech: Obama Receives Right-Wing Praise for ‘Just War’
On Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against America's enemies, hailed the speech Obama had delivered on Thursday.
The conservatives, who had discredited the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Ms. Palin, a leading figure in the right wing of the Republican party, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo dedicated himself to justifying the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives rejoiced, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway."
The former elected representative, who some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear from “a left-wing president” when he reminded Nobel committee members “that they would not be free nor could they hand over a peace prize if the use of force did not exist.”
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current Washington Post columnist, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as he “always does,” he “spoke like an American president” in reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they didn’t create and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, a Bush-era falcon, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton called the speech "monotonous, pretentious, and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the centre-left press praised the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "overproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California newspaper enthusiastically commented.
Obama “pronounced the speech that was necessary,” the New York Times estimated, judging it “both gloomy and uplifting.”
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee Christmas supply
After three marathon negotiation sessions, the road trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers’ organisation that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that puts an end to the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supply.
During Friday night’s signing session, Transportation Secretary Dominique Bussereau was “rejoicing” about the deal, following several negotiating sessions that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of talks, the negotiators bid farewell at dawn on Friday in the hopes of quickly signing the text accordingly late in the morning.
Even when three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by giving a doorbell.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to companies" and "was feared to disturb the holidays," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there will be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some disgruntled rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow above all to address the issue of an extraordinary payment and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that “a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million cut in employers’ burdens” was the subject of a government amendment in the 2009 finance bill of rectification, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote “on the same terms.”
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to the companies adhered to this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done “as soon as possible,” Bussereau said.
The opposition of employers’ organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a “naive business”, since the 100 million euros “had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax”.
The Secretary of State for Transport obliged us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, Unostra lamented.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector during the next 12 months".
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
Conflicts on the RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend because at Friday’s meeting, the 2nd day of strike between unions and RATP management, there was no agreement and unions were unhappy with their request for a premium.
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will circulate between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., at the rate of one train out of two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, rejoiced that "the RATP strives to provide service to the big stores."
The RER A crosses the Parisian city from west to east.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, approximately one in two trains operated at peak hours, and almost no trains at low hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had got up “an hour and a half earlier to get to the timetable.”
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had provided for the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the subways.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday and will analyze the results, "unsatisfactory" according to unions, of a meeting that was held with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes negotiating a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That’s not what drivers who claim a premium owed to them want, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT commented indignantly, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
Which also led unions to say the company “didn’t care about weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, who until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could extend to the RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Indépendants filed a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line that has one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for schedules with alternating shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish court dissolves pro-Kurdish party, decision with grave consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court ruled Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked outbursts of anger in the Kurdish community, the country's southeast and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the court, Hasim Kiliç, told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to get the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and lawmaker Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the termination of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that deputies would leave Parliament before becoming parliamentarians without a partisan label.
The decision follows a 2007 case by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya accusing the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no “organic ties” to the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s verdict comes as the government extends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in Southeastern Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
The Forces of Order threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters dropped Molotov bombs or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, approximately one hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deepen the discouragement.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by dissolving a party, he told reporters.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
This is not how anything can be solved, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly.
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is not at all something with which you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the FED
But with it your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
Meteorologists may announce it for the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF is acting in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A sections leave with large vehicles with salt, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also access for the fire brigade, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloped sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
EDF service starts around 3 a.m.
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which adheres better.
That's why the FES starts around three in the morning, "thus the roads are free until the rush hour traffic begins".
The hard part is when it starts to snow around 7:30.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to make room for vehicles with salt."
Immediately after, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the discomfort comes in, Brauburger knows.
Around five in the morning the infantry of the FES is launched, mainly the dangerous points and cruisers are cleared.
In general, the EDF could not take over all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 10 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. does not lose sight of the bridges, Brauburger says.
As these quickly become slippery, the salted vehicle starts up as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa hallae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high that ran on the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the journal Science on Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists started an excavation in 2006 at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we’ve found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member at the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they gathered in total the remains of five specimens.
Discovery Confirms Theories About Ancient Dinosaur History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional find: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadrupedal sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and the Ornithischia by herbivorous species, and the Ornithischia by herbivores.
According to analysis by Nesbitt and colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt says.
For example, in the skull of Tawa, researchers found signs of air pockets, such as those also possessed by the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to air pockets, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
In Tawa’s case, the bones of the spine were also evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of later giant sauropods also possessed air pockets and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers deduce that the saurians first arose there.
Accordingly, the three genealogical lineages were initially separated and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single landmass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa found the remains of two other theropods not very closely related.
The three cannot be descended from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are opponents as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Their opinion could give a distorted picture, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line from reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of modern crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded around the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct on the Triassic boundary towards the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to defeat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slowed the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt resonated throughout the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the students in protest on the Westend Campus.
In a statement drafted in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, had the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike evicted last week, because the walls and works of art were covered in propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the students and professors themselves by a police commando".
The eviction represented an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to “delegitimize and criminalize protest” and diverted attention from the content.
The Board of Directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most of the occupants did not cause material damage, it is said.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also show their solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for one’s own future, says Verdi’s national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the action of the university rector and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented in a Aktuelle Runde broadcast on Thursday in the parliament of Wiesbaden province.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are evicted.
The Left had tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers of micro and nanoelectronics.
Already since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted the Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "Protocol of close collaboration".
Moscow's Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad's Mayor Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt signed chief planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research center will travel to a seminar in Selenogrado.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
It also deals with trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the possibility to put a foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to major Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortia Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the landscape of wooded mountains, in which research facilities were set up.
Stuttgart Brakes
The Stuttgart Dimension 21 is not placed at all high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
The so. S21 law is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate to the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Rail terminals, which end up in the middle of the city, were considered at the time to be 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes on modern rail traffic, since in ancient times it took an enormous amount of time to hook the locomotives back and forth.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that is why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a stopover station, which is located approximately halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will really be initiated, even though the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course also have no more inbound and outbound problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE built section towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged it this way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic’s large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
A new urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the designer’s computer-generated graphics.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and the road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing in other crossings and narrow passages on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the slow-step route has been built.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The Rhine Valley section will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the ruling on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the autonomous parliament of Wiesbaden, if it is going to file an appeal against the ruling on the ban on night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The administrative court in Kassel had written on this date, that in the case of the construction of the planned northwestern runway at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as foreseen by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to file an appeal against this ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal to the nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recrimination that the federal government would be attempting by misrepresentation of the law and still tricks to get its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite some time.
The coalition does not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally flawless decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Just as the opposition represents it, it would never have been the claims of his group about the ban on night air traffic.
The U.S. banks return the loans.
The big American banks shaken by the crisis are stripping themselves of their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned at once the aid that had been lent to it by the bank rescue fund Tarp of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And Citi Group also plans to return state aid, according to a U.S. CNBC report.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The "Bank of America" had made approximately 19 billion dollars of cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough means, among others by the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers on Wednesday night especially: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank had miscalculated the investment bank’s absorption effort at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to make money in the capital market to be able to free itself of its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from known circles that the U.S. bank could announce by Thursday an increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative from the Citi group declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their subsidies.
Quick Choice
In the end, everything went faster than we thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative council of the ZDF (German television channel) pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night the guild wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main studio of the ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially so as not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely it also influenced not to harm further the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be approved in the board of directors either.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The outcome of the vote was not yet finalized at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender’s contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated, they were not going to support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of the Hessian government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, that under Brender’s direction ZDF news would have lost audience ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which he scourged political influence over the ZDF.
In the end, 35 public law experts had even meddled in the debate, who called Koch’s course unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He later worked on the station "Südwestfunk" and on the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional demand after the impeachment of Brender, who was chosen as journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin" on Wednesday.
Koch’s opponent in the administrative council, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the ZDF’s state agreement in such a way that the director’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of political supporters from the ZDF controlling guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board of directors with a clever move: he strongly criticized the guild for the impeachment of Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence Schächter was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a henchman partisan.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is allocated anyway to the liberals of the left.
College careers are clearing up
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in the cases of bachelor and master.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the exam load: basically each module of the course must end with only one exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federated states commit to more flexibly crafting the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master careers.
Regulations of the federated states that diverge from this should no longer exist.
Fewer exams
Since the start of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have continually talked about the improvement of being able to successfully pursue and complete a career (studyability).
Now, for the first time, there is talk of specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam", says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the passing of university courses.
The "sensitive reduction of the exam load" is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studyability" should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of courses.
the courses.
Students would have “the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage self-initiative.”
These rules would apply to new races, but also in examining existing races.
These must be "re-credited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until the year 2015 to examine all races.
Responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is installed by the federated states.
The education and culture ministers urged the federal states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
Until now, only Rhineland-Platinum has provided additional means for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement tutoring and student counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam and overseas offices.
The federal state and universities intend to have 10 million euros available for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring a novel of university law to parliament.
According to her, a single exam should be enough for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of assessments in other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all careers about their "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federal state.
Aside from the praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
At the federal board of directors of the Juso (young socialist) university groups, it was demanded that the configuration of education policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
At the latest in the wake of the education strikes, students should now be able to comment as well.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Education Ministers, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union demands a legal right for each student with the Bachelor’s degree the possibility of accessing a later Master’s degree.
In addition, the states must ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough study places for Masters with the best possible study conditions, as reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federated states have to hire quite a few more teachers.
But about greater access to the master’s degree, the Ministers of Education made no comments.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
“Entering and leaving Germany is almost unchecked,” says the first line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner in imbalanced language fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arriving in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, then as a reader in a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he gave the memorable lectures or lectures on poetry in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He spoke a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German Literature in Romania in the Mirror and the Disfigured Mirror of its Securitate Files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Attempts to recruit had begun slowly, in early 1971.
“I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against the Securitate’s attempts to provoke fear,” Söllner said.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that evidences the abyss and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only an author, but also a victim.
In his file for Securitate IM Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner’s confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him at all difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this statement,” he said.
Söllner’s statement in this form and in front of this public was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies from the Securitate-Spitzel Gewesen, Herta Müller wrote in the weekly "Zeit" as early as July, after reading her own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and known in some cases, what names were hiding behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of control files by the Securitate is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in the year 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather slippery.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite great. In this interview a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke derogatory of the decorated.
"She has psychosis," in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be manifest in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there is silent guilt.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession suggests that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the craving for knowledge and not so much by the adjudication of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, it is more than a simple footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the VfB football team in Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it gave the impression that a member of the elegantly dressed exterior service was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer would have distributed samples.
The man of the bald feature had hired a driver, because he did not yet know the city.
Moreover, he could have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old man was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we reached the round of 16", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we can not let ourselves be blinded by the success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The “much more important task” awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sweepstakes
The Champions League round of 16 (one-way matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/back games on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So joy was kept limited by the fulminant entrance of Babbel’s successor.
Not only in the so-called savior, who had in a short time inspired the bewildered Stuttgart pros with self-confidence, willingness to surrender and a taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more pitched, explained the soul repairman Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He displayed a certain magic, Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann accepted, "when in football a new impulse arises, sometimes things happen that would not have been believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to an injury quickly advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what was evidently lacking when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, sports manager Horst Heldt warns
But above all, VfB Stuttgart needs consistency.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also refrained from overestimating the win against a defense weakened by lack of relays and totally overtaken by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 the sad awakening had come, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been reached, the other was still a long way off.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt did not want to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, faced Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in the management of the board of directors, which had decided to change coaches due to pressure from teenage fans.
Also that his day off had been eliminated after the games was described by Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's remarks were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the back.
They probably won't be friends forever anymore, the two fortysomethings.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the substituted coach’s team, the show of great play and battle might not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important part in the success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
Fighting at the World Heavyweight Championship
Burning duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges’ judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC association version defeated American Kevin Johnson on Friday night in Bern by a unanimous point decision (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had hoped for could not be performed.
Klitschko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators at the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters shorter, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging the world champion’s blows over and over again, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right hand to his target.
Generally speaking, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie", who "can't do anything".
During the weigh-in, the champion was provoked Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of nearly four years, he beat Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
That year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba in his title defenses and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I received only one blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream is still to bring all four major titles together in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall, in November.
The previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Allegedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the group of the greens, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, a liar, because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has reproached Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) for knowingly misleading.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast on the ARD television channel, the head of the Green group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly did not tell the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional assassination is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy, and whether the Foreign Ministry, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, decidedly rejected the criticism.
The foreign ministry had no influence on concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, they had also raised doubts about the Ministry’s presentation of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the two high-ranking officials’ background it was revealed that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far, no response has been received, he said.
The ministry did not speak out on Saturday about the accusations made against it, and said this would be clarified in the commission of inquiry of the Federal Parliament, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
In a waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unhindered surrender to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during wakefulness, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world to be mad or addicted, or at least a maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or the drugged.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
The dream-modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychoses and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of communication neuronal substances in the brain—especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine—has been disrupted and interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During a schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and insane thoughts occur very often.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of waking sleep, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of the state of madness with the dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the nonsense, crazy formations, and spies".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with blood-red grimaces, deformed, grinding their teeth.
They are chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Stride and evil voices resound from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, ties them to form a hanging knot, and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope is loosened.
What a lesson for you! cried the voices in a chorus that burst his eardrums, "Go to the clinic and have you healed!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, disturbances in the relationship, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain is no longer able to filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the gates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatric clinic at the University Hospital of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time he enters a passive role, as in a dream, feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Have experienced a hallucination once in your life
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are supported by reality, distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it’s still unclear why our brains make turns.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality on a temporary basis.
But not everyone develops a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic arrangement for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain’s neural maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which also does not manifest at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when a previous disposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmitting system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experiment with some, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in einem Kopf (The unreal world in our head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical symptoms accompanying psychoses, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and head trauma.
Surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers from hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or are little inhibited; when our brain warms up, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, love affliction or other brain states of exception.
In the course of the study, the researchers found that there was a significant amount of evidence to suggest that there was no evidence to suggest that there was a significant amount of evidence to suggest that there was a significant amount of evidence to suggest that there was a significant amount of evidence.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a weird dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she’s not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and hears that boy, the same way she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel their presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – to his eyes and ears – is presenting a new classmate, while for the rest he explains the mathematical equations visibly and audibly.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the sleep, which often comes late and is scarce, she does not know whether she is awake or dreaming, if the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he yells at the figures.
She hasn't told her parents and friends anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations have been gone for a year.
Ever since she got in touch over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of despair.
According to Kasten, when a person finds himself socially isolated or suffers a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and is in charge of seeking entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was little afraid of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he has been calling dad since he had use of reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies nighttime fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends his patients to appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
The boundary between sleep and hallucination
In this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that subsequently can not differentiate from being awake.
Dream conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with an imaginary world of one’s own that is decoupled from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change of world, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 when his conscience embarked on multi-day journeys after heart valve surgery with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he found himself prostrate in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching over his health.
It was seen in the early Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike kidnapped him in his home country, surfed over his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and ran into a Korean mobster.
It gives it all in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in the irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychoses, hallucinations and narcotics use show how fragile the inner reproduction of the outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
The children will take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new Kallen editor has come to a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, confirmed Burda, 69, to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if you are trained to do so.
One cannot put their children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end up with the children and also with the company.
Burda announced Thursday that he will retire from the board chairmanship starting in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This 52-year-old Kallen family member has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for technology.
After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, he also took over direct marketing, overseas, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the top of the publishing house.
Burda’s sons are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who would now be 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from decline: "This has always affected families who let themselves be infected by the eagerness to seek capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I have never had “delusions of greatness,” says Burda.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play with “Time” in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything - in terms of beauty and well-being - you can wish for, at your fingertips.
This is what seems to have been proposed by El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the Callao shopping center (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which is in charge of laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the tea shop stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxión offers.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'coaches' that guide the steps of customers, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal key on a touch screen in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to correctly perform our exercise chart.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the Luis & Tachi firm has a room where rituals of hair recovery, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Variant necklines
Christmas is approaching and it is never too late to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party costume.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to boost what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electric Cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
This is intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in terms of the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has active a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, foreshadows "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has put in place throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a scenario of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants,” said the president of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of peace of mind for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized governmental measures to support demand, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and car brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "by 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and fans of motor racing.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the world of motor.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the classic engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, catering; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and catering; or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Abroad Skill Testing
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be complemented by parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports exhibitions, tests of skill, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be conducted on an enabled circuit outside the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated in the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system - baptized as i-Stop - a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good score achieved throughout.
The finishes, the finishing of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting from the cockpit, we check that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and support.
The touch of the steering wheel is also exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument cluster and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese features more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the time being, is only available with the two-litre, 150-horsepower gasoline engine and the six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its reduced noise, for its performance and for achieving low consumption.
And is that although the Mazda3 most in demand will be the diesel versions, those who do not perform a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high driving comfort, as for its low consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is, the one that incorporates a greater number of series elements.
From the standard equipment stands out especially the lane change assistant (RVM) that eliminates the blind spot, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, as if its equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenon headlights and BOSE sound system with disc loader, among other elements.
Concluding
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for its behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this version i-Stop, associated only with the gasoline 2.0 engine of 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day great doses of satisfaction.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.

Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
After the success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifelong data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It’s just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it’s like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly appealing and it would have had to be up and running for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
The European Commission’s repeated pushing of ears to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe has hardly had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (it is curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this type of rates means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It’s a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month-to-month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifelong access purchase option like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my email on the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's coloring page
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the American first lady.
If you already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -greenish yellow with bright reflections-, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces -dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric-, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestibule.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the takeover it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with print.
The accessories have also varied: green half-heeled shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one picked up on this occasion, mane looses the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fertility and career path of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to motherhood.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of coexistence as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have a non-stable job, start cohabitation as a couple, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
In contrast, women in stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years old with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time of their life trajectory to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on motherhood but less on the timing of mating," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they marry and when they have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they marry and have their first child.
The difference also remains between women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those who have elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average respectively.
"There is also another division between women according to their level of education.
While those who have elementary school get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, chanting the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous signings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the men’s section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (“Grey’s Anatomy”) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline’s partner in “Lost”).
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives – designers and models, yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony, which was held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Model of the Year.
The Poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent gives away in 'Poquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in some cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and dreadful genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The trip has its excitements and Vicent spares no frights or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to reading and rereading.
Here are a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same one that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against ungodly fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between helplessness and ignorance, with a dazzling, senseless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, to be climbed on the north wall, from which the best climbers fall again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was heir to a county landowner and sometimes that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane cry thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to carry his echo to the back of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
Dorothy Parker once said, “One day she got on her knees and prayed, ‘Dear God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.’”
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'Dream after effort,/ after storm the harbor,/ rest after war,/ after life enough pleases death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In the baggage she also brought her depressions.
The husband accepted with all normality that she told him that Edward VII spied on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja by Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cella do but to abduct the fame of that man so that it might serve him as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a specimen of a mixed breed, rescued from the kennel and weighing no more than six kilos and, without a word, gave him two kicks that left the dog injured.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find the fun in a gratuitous aggression against a small and helpless animal, which by the way, was tied.
To this we must add the hot flash that caused a lady who walked quietly and who, when he rebuked these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energetic who attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred at five in the afternoon on a Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt that it serves for a lot and not to generate susceptibilities, only to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to mistreat free of charge a helpless animal that gives us affection, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, mainly among younger motorcyclists, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of using the helmet, since it is the only protective element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day” and said it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe products.
Sales of light commercials rise
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of manufacturers Anfac and that of sellers Ganvam.
The good data, not ostentatious, should be quarantined since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the rebound of the last month, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold together all the vehicles that make up the tailoring drawer of light commercials: derivatives of passenger cars, pick ups, vans, light vans and light trucks / chassis.
Likewise, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also acquired by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
So to the restrictions imposed by the closed tap of bank credits, we must add other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Given this panorama and unlike the cars, little has been done by the purchase aids of the 2000E.
They can be used, in addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs that will acquire a light commercial up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they again recalled the need to dedicate special attention on the part of the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrial ones (trucks and buses).
The association of sellers forecasts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As with ABS antilock brakes and ESP stability control, emergency braking systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a lack period is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, by their way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by range.
The emergency braking assistant does this by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver’s footstep.
But it doesn’t always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study by car components manufacturer Bosch, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brakes before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, demands the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater – it is estimated that one in four personal injury claims would be avoided – when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via a radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors Delays Opel Plan to January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - on the 8th - according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM says a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch sports car maker Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining momentum.
In case there was no deal with either of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China’s Baic.
The decision remains to close Saab by the end of the year if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its ultimate, expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to slim down no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, in the first place, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of canvas with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they gained 7 kilos more; riding sports bacquets, 19 inches light, and 12 inches more.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the door handles for ones of fabric, the remaining kilogram.
Although also offered with the dual-clutch PDK gearbox, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual gearbox, mainly on California secondary roads, on mountain stretches with really twisted tracks.
Their behavior can only be described as flawless.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not step on the asphalt with aplomb.
Rather, quite the opposite: it’s been a while since we’ve tested such a small, lightweight model that, at the same time, conveys so much confidence in cornering, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles in a short gait for the necessary time, until we order him to squeeze, to brake, to recover and to squeeze his engine again...
Thanks to its direction, as communicative as precise, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very achieved and can be enhanced with the option 'sport' and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already debuted previously in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from standstill or in recoveries.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the bumps well.
The electronic aids barely made an appearance all along the way; and that in some of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, already well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate with Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional "starlette" of the parades of the "maison", the singer lavishes her face bag with as much contempt as her Chanel bags.
More than ‘Bad Girl’ or ‘It Girl’, it’s a ‘Bag Girl’.
Baskonia wins a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in their visit to the complicated court of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous losses with which the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and in this way he is in the lead of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 rating).
The Victorian team knew how to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with great doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The match started face to face for the azulgranas, who were put from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already foreshadowed that they had jumped to the Israeli court with hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac’s inner play and the work of Eliyahu, who was greeted with pricks and applause on the return to his home, to continue expanding his lead at rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'less six' rating of Splitter already foreshadowed that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being on track to rest, was not decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court does not win anyone, and with 'the hand of Elías' squeezing managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellows' turning to the bright (50-49).
More inconveniences
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but no less dead, needed to spin a couple of plays with success to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring income (54-67), which managed to make up the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alaveses left to leave the skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic's team did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis came close in the final minute (80-85), the match already had an owner and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the lead of Group B of the Euroleague, in a game marked by the losses of the cashiers, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the marker 22-20, minute 13, at which time an action, a fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to operate showing their superiority within both zones, where the injury loss of English center Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez, were weighing on the boxers.
Between the inside players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, increased the lead 44-32, minute 19.
An Impossible Revival
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, was superior and even even equaled the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, 27th minute, which made the group's leadership falter.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last loss of the Scottish center Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja by the direction and the triples of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when it tightened and given its superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
The Croatian center Nikola Vujcic, managed to reassemble the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja went out, handing the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads for real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The tool How much should you collect? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross a year and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 that receives a Spanish one.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by that of dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought after jobs on the net in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, when he would officially end his term.
Francisco Catunda, business manager of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date the embassy, where he remains refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya said he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the status of political asylum that the "de facto" government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tone in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct asset purchases and indirectly giving free liquidity bar to near-zero rates for financial institutions to purchase assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are almost over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are starting to throw some sand in the cogs as the ECB did with its year-over-year auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain the economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the risk premium reduction.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have rebounded again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was once again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the haven chosen by investors, causing a widening of the differentials of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go wrong to silence moral risk advocates who were again trying to create a conscience charge on those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of the credit restriction on the destruction of jobs, when what would have to be done is decree a new Thanksgiving day.
However, what Dubai paints is a tribal struggle between the emirs to rebuild power in the emirates and what Greece has seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for ECOFIN to save Hungary from defaulting on its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to break its commitments.
What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to make its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves facing an episode of normalization of transient risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads widen like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If European spreads decrease and ours continue to widen, then it would be Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor’s is an anecdote: When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise upwards their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to get back on track with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur much life expectancy at their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "prudence, driver friend".
Related Sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is debated these days.
After his intervention, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brushstrokes of what he had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion between that date and 2030, as long as the nuclear power plants remain open today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be $60 billion, but up to $95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue is changing and the power needs to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, that is, with other "support energies".
Galán, who considers that the draft Sustainable Economy Law that the Government has just approved is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to incentivize the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies to fight against climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "punctual" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán considers that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should begin to be made already because they are slow to mature and a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground airport services, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports in which it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not transcended, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Center
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway in concession in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The Frenchwoman Bouygues and the German Hochtief are her rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a highway builder and concessionaire.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for the public-private partnership (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan supervised by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
Waiting for them to present their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase compete three consortia with remarkable presence of European construction companies.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in line, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium plays against the Acciona team, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screen is the so-called LBRJV, where share capital the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatizations, but brings a clear difficulty of entry if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionaire assets
It is committed to a geographical area of utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate those two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The Underground Tollway, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called the Northern Link, is intended to link the Toowong Western Highway with the Kelvin Grove Ring Road (see map) along a 5-kilometre tunnel, the largest action to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its financing.
Brisbane offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruits to Hochtief, who announced yesterday that he has been awarded a contract with the government valued at $154 million.
The stakeholder in ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and provide employment to the German company for 18 months.
The company has also transferred the 27-storey King George Tower construction project to the Australian city of Brisbane, with works still to begin and Hochtief closing the sale at 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O’Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC awards tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The contract comes just days after the construction of the Bosruck tunnel in Austria for 130 million euros.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its expertise in tunneling.
The start of the works is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its execution period will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded the publicity of Renfe
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen among the 16 agencies that submitted to the contest convened by Renfe of which four were finalists, including TBWA which was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for dampening competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and that, therefore, it is a repeat infringement.
App Store
In addition, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an app store on the internet, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made $476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club that have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has allocated 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have come out well from this cast.
The white club has been the third in the continent that has pocketed the most money to participate, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, billed the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made more money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution (distribution)
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA’s complicated money-sharing procedure.
For this exercise, the body that presides over Michel Platini expects to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each match they play.
There are also bonuses to win (800,000 euros) and to tie (400,000 for each team). The eighth-finalists will receive three million each; the eighth-quarter-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be pocketed 4 million each.
The champion will win $9 million, compared to the finalist's $5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million to win the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main languages, and has four places allocated.
The champion of the previous year takes 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% of SOS
The New Rumasa group yesterday revealed the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a takeover bid (OPA) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be repaid with an interest for this postponement of 1% per year.
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerezan group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If realized, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of SOS is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, SOS continues to restructure its direction.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and the judicial ups and downs of its former managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the chairman of the group.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will unveil new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Audience and affirmed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV authorizes the exclusion offer of Paternina that presented Investora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion bid submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation because it understands that its terms conform to the current rules and considers "sufficient" the content of the explanatory brochure presented after the modifications introduced on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New tools for driving cars
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered an accident are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No accident is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Calculating manually the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools it would be a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, then elaborating it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms that compete in the field of assessment tools and elaboration of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex’s commercial director, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that more versions, variants and motorizations have been released in the last five years than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very difficult task, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and introduce its price.
In addition, each model is made a graphic image "smart" where you can "pin" different parts of tourism.
If it’s a mass-market model, the job can be done in a week if the process goes too fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually experts in mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in developing these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data items are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most common use focuses on repair and maintenance, but in which countries there are also tools for managing scrap parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used ones in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the star product being AudaPlus, the standard solution of assessment of claims, intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each rating.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of assessments, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet that allows bidding for vehicles declared total loss.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analysis or knowing deviations by brands or models.
It can be studied, for example, how many models of a certain brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or official prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for valuation of damage, breakdown or maintenance of the car.
The Gt Appraisal Guide is your historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their turnover has grown at a rate of 20% annually in the last three years, and in 2008 they turnovered 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to sources of the company, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange, and now its shares are listed for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Online auction of accidented cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special accident vehicles.
The transaction involved a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This valuation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scrapshops and professional sellers who must register before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been cancelled may not be re-circulated, but certain parts that are not damaged may be used as a replacement.
Cars with historical value can be registered even if they have been discharged after a difficult process.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Workshop tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a budget and generate a budget.
Ease of use is an essential constraint for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent are usually more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 off-roaders, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary spare is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print the quote to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalog of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
The Audatex company is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
