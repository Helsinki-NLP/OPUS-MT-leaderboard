Barack Obama will be the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth American president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will be awarded to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the very first time with the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's schedule then includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will reach its peak in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the award, but only the third to receive the award within the Committee.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the awards ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is fighting a war in two countries at the moment.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, diploma and a check of ten million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million euros).
He intends to donate to charities, but has not yet decided which ones.
His busy schedule will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at this price at first.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that this is not a prize for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said it would be an "invitation to act".
Nature Advocate Accused of Blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police charged the president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for withdrawing his appeal, said Alena Romová, Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice is Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting dumpsters are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you come across sorting dumpsters at every corner.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before finding the right dumpsters.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the waste in Brno at all.
But I feel that the city councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can only sort paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of dumpsters dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires especially time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found so far is the Moravian square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't mind me, but it seems to me very little.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it is not a sinecure either.
So in the end, many of my friends don’t sort out their waste.
It's laziness.
It's a trick for them to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised at all.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw away some bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colored dumpsters on Kounikova Street.
Fortunately I found the right place by going to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It is after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is probably that ecology and a so-called aestheticism do not interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that embarrasses the city across the country, instead of buying a few extra dumpsters and proposing the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to confirm my impression with official statistics after hanging out on the internet for a while.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget has taken away money from pensions and sick leave
After the left has grown, despite the advice of the government, farmers or even civil servants, there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they relied on the fact that the government would borrow for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems off later, undermining the ground," said Janota.
It should be noted that on the money borrowed the interest payable is increasing and that it will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The state does not really have a choice as to where to get the money.
If he does not lower social assistance or his spending, he will have to raise taxes.
To all those whom the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a larger debt of the state - next year there will be no shortage of 163 billion in the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it, the expenses related to interest.
The state will need money to pay it back and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or decrease maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be $5 billion left to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and begun, and it is not possible to modify the projects to reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major construction sites, and the withdrawal of European funds is also at risk, according to Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very skillfully - it will draw on the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ (electricity supplier and distributor), which the State owns for the most part and will feed the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no case a bottomless pit.
Last year, 18 billion were shipped from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Each year, the dividends are used to pay for the elimination of ecological damage, to supplement the pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GNP under EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crime, or even housing savings, has been reduced by nearly three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international proceeding, we will have to pay for it anyway, Janota said.
The minister will then have to save on the department’s side or, at worst, touch the government’s budget reserve.
There is also a $100-million shortfall in the two-billion-dollar state fund project, which will allow each administration's spending to be tracked online.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would be imposed, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
With just one button, you can switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which is mainly concerned with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
The two will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not fiction at all.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, which ran the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems simultaneously.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now collaborating with European and U.S. carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to devices in 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
Deserted runways are not only a problem for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the time being.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, an operator of the news portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n, it is better not to hesitate too much to book.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of the accommodation comes only later, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler are currently only offering one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they will try for a while to place them, but they will also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of vacant rooms will rapidly decrease," Jandura said.
The tourism agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The week of Christmas we are most interested in at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There are still, let’s say, half the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas holidays,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays sell on average.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting for her to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks cover during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiefert thinks.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few places left for the New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the January holidays of the Poles and February also sells well," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> is also eighty percent complete during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at the moment.
February is a little weaker for now but as soon as the snow will fall, interest in stays in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will certainly grow again, said the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, hoteliers in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e should not expect more snow.
Thursday will be cooler and if there is rain, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But then the weather should warm up, reports Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
U.S.: Rehearsal is the Mother of Wisdom
It even becomes comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president with a reputation for wisdom, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he himself considered as very simple.
When he finally let his long-awaited doctrine perspire, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since Bush’s Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not content with using the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text, he did not hesitate to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward".
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements to a civil war-ravaged Iraq as “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences.”
The months that followed, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to be so successful that the newspapers at present do not speak at all of Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that is, objectively speaking, it left his successor in a much more favorable final situation than one could hope.
Barack Obama hopes the miracle will happen again in Afghanistan
It was again campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, notably the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but for lack of a better option, he at least deceived the 10,000-strong general.
He succeeded in extracting the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally counted on 10,000.
What brings the most problems in all of Obama’s strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and complete this whole process within three years.
Many doubt that a halving increase will bear the same fruits as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out because of the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaties are respected.
In these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders on a day-to-day basis as they see fit.
Political institutions, although formally founded, will remain only powder in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity in relation to relations, which are further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a “prompt to act state,” which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is perplexed by its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse and it is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out-of-reality heart can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the turmoil of war for their "prompt return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the tightened sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult question of solving the problem through the use of military force.
It will have to be responded to, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
Obama’s only blurb is the fact that he has three years until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 top executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
The shares can be withdrawn from the leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link pay with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global sense to take, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will likely exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, high premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain said on Wednesday it planned to allocate a single 50 percent tax on bonuses from bankers exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
Five women, a record number, were awarded the Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and literature today in Stockholm from the hands of King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine with their compatriot Jack Szostak for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last laureate of the Nobel Prize in Economics, American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has not had a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner has received the Diploma, Nobel Medal and Certificate of Acquisition of the Monetary Award.
It reaches SEK 10 million in each category. (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward with each other.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his award since he is only at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the expense of his policy he added that in some situations war is essential to obtain peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay in the government due to his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further exacerbates the public finance crisis.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed of the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss her role on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget that will be submitted to Klaus's signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday approved the proposals of the left on money transfers and increased the remuneration of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the proposals of the Social Democrats for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, which calls into question the future of Fischer's cabinet which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as voted by MEPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by the Fischer government and which, according to it, must contain the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but is under no obligation to do so, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have long overlooked the “serious problem” of the “irrepressible deficiency” of public finances.
In his view, there is now no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could rely on broader political party consensus, the president said.
SDG President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is appalling and the government should question its future existence.
SDG Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, SDG and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is appalling and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD described as successful the ratification of the State budget for next year.
The People’s Party was also pleased.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaded will expose to the world many things about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman stars in the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said, it was a ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" drama set in the middle of boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of an anti-slavery movement who has become himself a slave, a fictional U.S. president, and even God in the movie Evan the Almighty.
The former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his hard work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team Francis to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team eventually progressed to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play that role in a way that brought him closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get your energy back, it gets passed on and I felt like I knew how you were feeling, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon stars in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, ‘I look a lot bigger in the film.’
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the leadership of director Eastwood received positive reviews and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed over Norway.
Russia's defence ministry said it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from Norway's borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava"-type missile that was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly, or it was damaged in mid-flight.
Russian newspapers talk of "Bulava" as the "missile that does not fly"
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th test was going on normally at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the aircraft.
It was clearly the third-stage engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew off the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving vessel and submerged
This is the reason why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object is likely to have been caused by a faulty “Bulava.”
The Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak of failure at all.
The first two stages of the rocket withstood and the damage only hit the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, Defense Department management considers only six out of thirteen to have been failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they still claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even take away ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will perform again in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a helping hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entry already during Friday’s match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It is unclear whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will involve only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, said Nyemchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world champion titles, he triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k of the Hyundai plant confirmed this.
The management, however, still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We can not give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz said the company offered a 400-CZK bonus to employees who would be part of Saturday's team.
It will also be awarded to posterori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for extra hours, or they can take an alternative leave on December 28 and thus extend their holidays indicated Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and demands of unions as well as workers who spontaneously ceased production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, employees at the auto plant were forced to work nearly two extra hours each day in addition to their eight hours.
The unions plan to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the auto plant management and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said Wednesday that they are ready to end the state of strike if they agree on their demands and sign a joint document.
The situation at the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and so-called bizutage.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work extra to meet the imperatives in automobile production.
At the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also demanded that employees who stopped production be subject to no sanctions.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a compensation of 5,000 crowns (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "durable" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
In some cases, this reality takes the upper hand over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, it is possible to radically extend the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a number of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metallocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings on virus proteins.
The metallocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cages with multiple walls are formed by the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If the protease of HIV is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in test specimens as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
The metallocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to be further examined to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, director of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biology.
Dispute over budget: SDG attacks Fischer, who defends himself
The chairman of the SDO (Civil Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek, called the ratified budget for the following year "scary" and said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the SDG’s remarks a drastic verdict.
He says he's taking the time to analyze.
SDG spokesman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the idea of an administrative cabinet backed by <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, SDG and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the head of government should decide whether to take support in the Chamber of Deputies from the minority who are concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about remaining in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned that the positions of the SDGs and the Social Democrats on the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday ratified the 2010 budget, but the proposals for amendments amounting to 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House increased money for civil servants' salaries, for the operation of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to run a Kronor 163 billion deficit.
The SDG left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that a modified budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will think again about the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as was convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office if the proposed amendments were ratified, the situation might be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota met with the prime minister on Monday after he took office:
At the same time, he said he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that the representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other deficit-increasing legislation such as health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: The ministers appointed by the SDG are not in question.
This is the business of the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDG did nothing detrimental, Topolánek stressed in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries claim TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the deficit in public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that he is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the House to the journalists, the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDG has backed down at the request of the Prime Minister.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed at the same time that the SDG would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked Democrats to allow the budget to be voted on.
We don't feel like we're orphans, we're not little children, he responded to the question of whether the SDG had not been reproached by the Party president in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote was missing.
I already knew by the time I resigned my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevikization of the House and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek responded in person.
According to the new schedules of the <0xC4><0x8C>D there will be fewer trains for identical fares.
The Czech Railways will abolish or limit some less-charged express or regional trains from 13 December, while reinforcing some others.
Total transport coverage will decrease on the day the new schedules come into force by two percent compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including the basic rates and the reduced rate.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad line will be drastically reduced.
At regional level, the largest decrease in transport is in the Hradec Králové region by a total of eight per cent, while Prague and its surroundings may welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations, one can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for now the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, which has been opened thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
Distance lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague’s main train station (Praha Hlavní nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í).
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jeseník will depart in two-hour intervals.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The invoice this year for regional railways: an additional 200 million kroner.
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in a total of four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year.The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate in almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not resort to a price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only affect <0xC4><0x8C>D Net one-day tickets and discounted eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again depend on the route travelled, whereas until then it was valid between cities of a region of your choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroner.
Filipino rebels still detaining more than 50 people, children released
The rebels today kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
The AFP news agency reported this, but originally spoke of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during a flight to the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused during a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in Maguindanao province in the southern Philippines following a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of the southern Philippines province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, along with his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood is coming to American theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), and narrates a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter has reverted to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, feedback from critics and audiences is heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film holds great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in the midst of preparations for the football world cup, and on the other hand because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black majority in power.
According to the AP, reactions to the new film are for the time being rather positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars "pawn".
Morgan Freeman, in his own words, is proud of the film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have prepared myself well.
I have also personally met Nelson Mandela many times so that I can – as they say – recover his energy, he said at the film’s official premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if we have the opportunity to recall Mandela’s personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual, he added.
Wearing the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to regroup two racial groups of a long divided population and as Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters dressed in the national jersey of the South African team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won then.
For showing himself on the jersey lawn, which is considered in South Africa to be something sacred, Mandela had been long cheered fourteen years ago mostly by the white public and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully the football league will succeed in bringing people back together in one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" on the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
South African whites are skeptical, however, as he recently said in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps of the distribution center near the municipality of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov na Lounsku.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, spokesman for <0xC3><0x9A>stí firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn out, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission set.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure will be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that <0xC4><0x8C>eps has not experienced anything similar in its ten years of activity and that incidents of this type are isolated.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ spokeswoman for North Bohemia So<0xC5><0x88>a Holingerova Hendrychova said that the operation of homes, administrations and industries was not affected by the fire at the processing station.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps is the exclusive operator in the Czech Republic of transmission assemblies and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transmission assemblies to the distribution assemblies and line layouts with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to file defamation complaint against three prefects of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, owner of the Student Agency, will file a defamation complaint today against three Democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the South Moravian region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region, Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura reported it in Dvacet minut of Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain areas.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of them attacked us and say we're making a fine mouth, when we've only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on the Student Agency company, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
Likewise, he indicated that he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers that Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s filing of complaint represents the continuation of his media show which serves him as a free publicity for his society and for his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who is manipulating public opinion and resorting to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavorable actions of the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broadest sense.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the railway links for an order of around 150 billion kroner, without issuing a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura threats from a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He ran as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I do not know who he is but I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying that a mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal disease are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute has already defined the maximum prices that health insurance will pay for vaccines.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Already last year a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
Yet parents paid 1600 crowns or even more for a dose.
Vaccination of young children requires four doses.
Experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between 300 and 450,000 crowns a year on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
Until now, the state had spent around 500,000 crowns a year on all vaccinations for children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
Aside from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
There are opinions about a possible vaccination requirement in the future.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference that our association attended, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
That's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that must now be followed," Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococcal.
We are absolutely not considering it at this time, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Paediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccination based on the voluntarita its defects.
If all children were vaccinated, one could consider a reduction in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the vaccination optional," Cabrnochová says, however.
Experts predict that as of next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break with the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products.
This is, however, linked to the concerns of pediatric practitioners, which concern the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some MEPs feared, however, that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct the sums from health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance to reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to individually invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
Son of American Artist Involved in 'Museum Flight'
Frank Frazetta’s son, a renowned illustrator, has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Frazetta and another man used a shovel to force the museum into the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to “enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility,” the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies giving such permission, the agency said.
Labour advocates raising the budget tax.
The ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Tories said Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about decreasing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor has also drawn the fury by tackling low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5% of Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Security
Trade unions have protested that low wages are being penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that “problems” are coming.
The decrease in Social Insurance – which will get around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year – has angered the business world, because it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small corporations has been abandoned
Tax Discounts on Electric Cars and Wind Turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 per year will earn an additional <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 resulted in "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be on the top 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Treasury Secretary, refuted a tax increase and pointed out that a decrease in spending was a “drop of water in the ocean” compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that economic growth would resume by the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence how much it will borrow and how quickly the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely fall by 4.75 percent this year — much worse than the 3.5 percent decline predicted in April — while borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Opportunity Missed"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday to warn against Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the plan to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to reimburse, they added, "cynically" eluding difficult choices until after the election - which is due to take place in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
“Important announcements will be made after the election, no matter who wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to Tory proposals that would result in a faster and more significant deficit reduction.
But the Lib Dems said the money raised from higher taxes and lower spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, saying the plans were "built on the wind."
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said the timing of the announcements - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits next April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda charges, with the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not release details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that restrictions on public spending would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor's figures would mean substantial reductions in many areas in the future, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
“The pain is actually only postponed,” said Director Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of who wins,” said Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s economic adviser to accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report. Markets are realizing it."
FBI Investigates ‘American Arrests in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who were reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are being detained," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been detained in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said the house was already being monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States should “cooperate further with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing from their homes in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian 'abuses'
In the last 20 years, human rights have been as poorly respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
The report presents “repeated violations” by the regime, both before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its failure to respect human rights.
Authorities have claimed that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the biggest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to imprisonment and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent says.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
“I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in half-conscious blood, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate Mehdi Karroubi claimed that protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison and others had been raped.
Iranian authorities denied allegations of rape, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he had been locked in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty has agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn the Bristol site into a race track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the trail in Brandon Hill Park, a small springboard preceded a 100m long trail.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the city lights shining below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prizes have been awarded to the best voltiges - or figures made on the track.
After the holiday on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.

Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious framework.
Good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls “Muslim spaces” for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows how to listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that worry the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
The conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen generally agree with their counterparts advocates of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who now make up a small part of Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite so virulently guarding secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a “narrowness of key values.”
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing into new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Ice Sheet" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved their worth by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then a brave aspiring 14-year-old who had to fight only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young teddy bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, who had just been killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally one millionth of the surface area needed by an adult in the wild. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has turned green because of the algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often recounts the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians on motorcycles use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a gripping glimpse into what the future there may be.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's not about not trying.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the pioneering voyages of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information about the melting of the ice sheet.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the changes in relief underneath it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic Ice-dependent system, formed by the nets of brackish water pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it may be our turn.”
Marines, among the 6,000 people who laid crowns on tombs in Arlington
First class De'Angello Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus ride to drop a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who were once in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the memorial site for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Shrouded in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not as often visited as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and couples held hands, carrying the fresh pine wreaths over the gray graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Close by, there was silence on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned over to see the small black and white information cards, sunk into the damp earth for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many tearful mothers on her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and drove eight hours to come and gather at the grave of Marine Sergeant Gunnery David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget that we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. Citizen Arrested by Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, the U.S. Foreign Ministry said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being “dangerous.”
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husbands and she is being followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but the authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of a U.S. national may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day’s salary.
On the island, internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often must communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas Program Director at Human Rights Watch, which recently released a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick elder brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when the two countries are beginning to initiate a better dialogue.
Pakistani Authorities Stop Conspiracy to Send Men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly preparing a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who are stalking the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were hunting down a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the internet video site YouTube.
Arriving in Pakistan, the men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not participating in the CIA’s plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east, which had become a refuge for terrorism.
They were seen as undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the case.
The official said the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to enter al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The cases of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasize the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence services have had as a priority to infiltrate men in the al-Qaida network.
The organization’s recruiters play the role of barrier guards, denying entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups must also pay more attention in recent years to the choice of people they accept as the US intelligence services have become experts on their recruitment methods.
“If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model than so many other people have already followed,” Kohlmann said.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of Thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen Call for ‘Climate Action’
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched through the streets here on Saturday, calling for greater climate action from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On this day when little has happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city, displaying signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish, declaring 'The Earth says it has had enough'.
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said traveling to her mother’s homeland of Peru has opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change already occurring.
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the great march -- to spread the word and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate talks, activists wearing black masks and clothing lit several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They would launch them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by “some big explosions.”
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march throughout the afternoon.
But it appears the protesters have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "Actually, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful depending on the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they are disrupting negotiations or harming the freedom of others."
Test results reveal stubborn differences between races
Last week’s federal report on math results brought good news for public schools in Washington, D.C.
Although the District still lags far behind the top settlements, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) have made much greater progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the performance of African Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average performance of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington, D.C., has increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but that of their African-American classmates has increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling by only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overview over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1) class, when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by the Group Director of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by the white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in the District's education.
“I’m not jumping for a point or two,” said Kwame R. Brown, a member of the D.C. Council whose daughter is in Grade 4 at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said the message from the test results is that the city’s middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what’s scary is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at schoolchildren in elementary and early school grades who have not integrated the basics of reading earlier in their school journey and who are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the math program, for classes from Kindergarten (kindergarten) to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on games and real-life experiences, as they have been set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the NAEP progress reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to deliver better interventions to those students below the level of the classroom," Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to elevate the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to narrow the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in Washington’s poorest neighborhoods.
Also this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they come from, are assured that their children will be able to get an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to narrowing the success gap wasthe length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with her teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" to get another raise in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descends and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of an impressed than enthusiastic new student.
Super That's where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? said she thoughtfully, when she was pointed out the low ratio of law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
While this question still arises largely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands who benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five 'second generation' Hispanics are still in high school -- a remarkable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, paving the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers studying wingmen say they have a natural affinity for school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won’t help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize college readiness programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue through the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been attended by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry secures deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure in two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq’s oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies departed with a stake in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who put an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies won contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The weak representation of U.S. oil giants in opening up the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an internet news site.
It will take a long time for another offer to be made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops withdrew have held back U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering more forcefully into Iraq, which has the world's third-largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with and provided technical advice to the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has bid more on contracts than other companies and has left with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to auction made bids that were then compared to the rate per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of al-Qaida's main organizers reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile that struck along the border with Afghanistan killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, U.S. counterintelligence officials said Friday.
If confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan’s anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistan’s civilian intelligence service, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
Officials said the suspected local activists rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what remained of “totally shredded bodies.”
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identities of the victims, but the two US counter-terrorism representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaida's military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies to attack the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somali had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaida and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general American public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official representative said.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second major al-Qaida figure or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has slowed since the summer, from about six operations a month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a nonprofit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site says.
UN special envoy in Kabul withdraws
U.N. Special Envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday he would resign in March, ending a tumultuous term tainted by allegations of widespread corruption during the U.N.-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the U.S. schedule for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign but would simply abide by the commitment he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it’s better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there had been a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already begun looking for a replacement.
Representatives say the name of Staffan di Mistura was cited; it is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election and concealing evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide denied the allegations but said Galbraith's accusations -- which he thanked -- "harmed the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism about international election observation."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged U.N. officials to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the U.S. and other Western countries than is allocated to the mission in Afghanistan, saying it would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the UN’s heavy hiring regulations were hampering his opportunities to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world’s major powers would soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a field of 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such a outcome.
One of the things that weighs on me the most is that if I’ve learned one thing in Iraq over the last six years, it’s the unpredictable side of war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has pointed out that some of those sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said a “set of motivations and punishments” might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons” because “its people would suffer enormously” from these sanctions.
In a statement on Friday, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face “probable” consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back into full compliance with the UN Security Council and its watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran insists that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment only for a peaceful purpose.
At the Geneva talks on 1 October, it said it would resume dialogue on reducing its nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant portion of its enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts at a deal – in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran’s stiffening in the face of some of the international community’s proposals for which they had actually agreed in early October, pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join on what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set Dec. 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turns to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet with Troop Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
The US authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by posters of propaganda preaching to them, “Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children” and “An extra baby is an extra grave.”
They learned the lesson so well that the Shanghai Government authorities, alarmed by the inadequate birth rate in their city and the aging population, radically changed direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
“We don’t have a second left,” said Wang, 31, a human resources director who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from six to 1.8 children per couple when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of labor in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual mitigation
Written in the country's 1978 constitution, China's one-child policy is to date, without question, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who break this policy may face huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese authorities have given the police a duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the execution of this policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women with a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boys-to-girls ratio.
In recent years, the population authorities have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced with copies of regulations detailing who is entitled to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slip prospectuses under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she wanted only one child because she was one of them herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us."
We’re not used to taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, says it more bluntly.
For middle-class couples working in pairs who lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish to succeed.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there's the space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only nine months old, you need to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has draft plans for reducing emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- hitherto characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- came back under the spotlight on Friday, with a document outlining ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of them in the coming years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as well as illuminating the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in the time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to withstand global warming, both in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could decrease their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN Executive Secretary-General on climate change Yvo de Boer described as the “full picture.”
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, by 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the U.S. representative to the climate negotiation, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if these were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is getting tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions from major developing countries, Stern said, also regretting that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after China's Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the U.S. chief negotiator either lacked "common sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing over their respective obligations as poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was no surprise that major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries became more aggressive in their attempt to hold large emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the key participants say the negotiations will lead to a minimum, political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission’s climate unit, said the action of small island states had “put political pressure on the full political process,” partly because they are now unified and calling on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on solving most of the outstanding issues before heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister got off their plane and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be considered over the next week.
The real picture of the rally -- in which 13,000 people enter and leave the Congress Hall every day -- is a challenge for guitar-playing activists to present nightly shows mocking countries that they believe betray and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the great,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavy trucks are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday Syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin commuter train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small lost holes will become flourishing suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter, and the passage from plane and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable scheduling battle and fears of environmental hazards are likely to put a brake on Britain’s high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment may be controversial.
In the campaign, the map will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a larger high-speed network, heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go as far as the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with one branch going west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It looks like it will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial layout is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
There are up to 18 trains per hour on the London - Birmingham route.
A terminal that could accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Given the space constraints, it is planned that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to run off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, retaining travel times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan for the Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, a senior member of the Tory parliament, has charged taxpayers thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his riding home.
The party official who was downgraded by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were "maintained" increased his loan of <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a check on members' expenses. Last night, Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his riding of Rutland - Melton.
The neighboring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for fun".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Committee on Privileges and Standards into his pre-borrowing arrangements.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of borrowing GBP 271,406 from his London property to his riding home which he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
Documents released this week show Duncan was claiming about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month of borrowing interest through March last year.
In April, its demands increased by more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The standard variable RBS interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as head of the shadow cabinet in September after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him saying members of parliament had to survive “on budget” after the spending scandal.
"Actually, it's now national, you have to live 'on budget' and you're treated like 'of the m...e'
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his former position as an oil trader, began having to explain his spending in May after it appeared he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the expense office that it “could be considered excessive.”
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3>1-shaped hole in Duncan’s lawn, to protest after it was revealed that he had asked for <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Duncan said: "It was for major improvements, approved both by the fee office and by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with stealing or making or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn’t be clearer or simpler.”
Faithful, come and see the Advent calendar of Brighton
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for each December day, using Christmas songs as the theme.
The event began on December 1st, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., every day, with pates and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the booth presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a church, why do we wait for people to enter an odd old building? It seems to me that the church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
“The idea for the beach cabin Advent calendar came right after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to experience and represent that through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, a hundred thousand according to organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations climate conference, tasked with reaching an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has helped to make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the march left, when a group of 300 demonstrators, entirely dressed in black, smashed windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist found.
Anti-riot police officers immediately intervened ruthlessly.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had notably illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were still detained in the streets Saturday night "cuffed and kept in a seated position despite the extreme cold".
Party of Parliament, the procession, rather good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, site of negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A stage had been set to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by bus and train from major cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue raincoats, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we take to the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that are drying up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has come closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of the alter-globalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "bind climate justice and social justice": "today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing solar-powered bandanas.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters were also held to call for energetic action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elects president, Georgia denounces 'farce'
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were expected to take part in the first election after the August 2008 Russo-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout was 58% a few hours before the closing, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which left several thousand dead, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who said she voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential elections in this region of sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Bagapch alongside the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the course of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the poll by former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as well as the one giving Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current power or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: protests around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen climate conference, where police arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, a hundred thousand according to organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, seeking an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The party of Parliament, the procession, generally a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter it.
A stage had been set to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the march left, a group of a few hundred protesters, entirely dressed in black, armed with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP journalist said.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened ruthlessly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had notably illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a cobblestone and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We are watching the small extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces were rotating in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by bus and train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue raincoats, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we take to the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

There are rivers that are drying up in Africa, there are streams where you can walk when you've never walked before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has come closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of the alter-globalism, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "bind climate justice and social justice": "today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The organization Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, the former UN commissioner for refugees Mary Robinson, who were supposed to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters were also held to call for action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The geo-history comes out strengthened from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography are coming out "strengthened" of the reform of the general high school, despite the suppression of their compulsory education in scientific terminal.
Now, all first-grade students will have four hours a week and the same curriculum for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the minister, "we must get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "basically, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L sectors cannot remain sub-branches of the S, he continues, stressing again: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant about the absence of history-geography in the terminal in technological high schools."
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven in ten French people (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to abolish compulsory history-geography education in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as did the left and some elected officials from the right.
The minister, on the other hand, added that there was "no question" of removing the philosophy of the S-terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will cover their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will cover their ability to teach, explained the minister.
They will also follow internships in situation during the year of M2 and then be a first year in front of the students as intern teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge faced on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the École Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of interventions of experts, fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist found.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish in the basin of the school.
Around twenty speakers are selected from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding global warming, "we can talk about the hours, but we can also talk about the key objectives in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke without notes, but using graphs, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos from these lectures will be posted online on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delayed Payments: Anger of Prison Watchers, Planned Actions
Prison watchdog unions on Friday called for a “general mobilization” to demand the payment of bonuses and overtime by the end of the year for which payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of prisons and to "block them", to "denounce the theft of their duties".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilization", judging "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Prison Autonomous Union (UFAP/UNSA), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger."
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all hours were budgeted, but ensure that the remaining hours will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I have asked the Prison Administration to put in place without delay a package of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not happen again in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meagre, except for management staff benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "the budget constraints have a good back".
It is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseilles was outraged, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and public holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the money of the staff, considers the CGT-Penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less badly lotted than others.
But anyway the account is not there, noted the secretary general of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Offers “More Cool Tricks” Than He Gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to the "doll" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule when it comes to gifts: "I give things more cool than those I receive."
As part of a special show to be aired Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle provide insight into how they intend to celebrate the holidays in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, saying the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama countered her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to concede before replying with humour by pointing to the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who offered you this?”
During this one-hour, casual-looking show with the celebrated hostess who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama spoke of a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember that time when I met my dad who came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized that it was he who had given me that ball.
The first lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn’t know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday reopened, RTL says he is in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reopened in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reopened on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors noted "injuries resulting from the operation" of the herniated disc suffered in Paris on November 26, his press service said in Paris, specifying that these injuries had "needed a restorative operation".
The singer's press service, however, was reassuring that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be released no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was however plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain was laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for this herniated disc.
The surgery, scheduled for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the arts.
He was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's news.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for an infection following the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a relative of Johnny Hallyday, said Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time", but assured not to worry about the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He called me just before he left for L.A., and I told him it was bullshit because flying twelve hours after such an operation is not playable, Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, was reassuring, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "contained".
Mr. Camus also said he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of the general public, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on from a “small colon cancer” and then from a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
Fans and journalists have noticed the singer’s difficulties in getting around the stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Bousquet's first on his fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medallist at the 2009 World Cup in the large pool, won an international title on Thursday over a distance he particularly loves, the 50 m freestyle, during Euro 2009 in the small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where suits are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while we were waiting for an outpouring.
One was upgraded by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relay men 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who was looking at the world record in the 50 m freestyle, of which he holds the mark in the big basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen swim distances, the 50 m freestyle, it was the Frenchman of 28 years who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at international level.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world record (20.30) as he had envisioned.
We can always dream better and in this case, I had said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the suits did not serve this time to the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in large basin this summer in Rome, world records in the key.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower the mark he holds on the 400 m freestyle (3:32.77) but nevertheless prevailed by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I haven’t been thoroughly involved in this race.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged to French writer Emile Zola was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, well above its estimate, art dealer Sotheby's said.
This front panel, two meters long by 63 cm high, dating from the 3rd century AD, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions for Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in his Parisian mansion, and at Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
There was a shadowy area of about fifty years.
In searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya’s aborted attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico
Mexico on Thursday considered that conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe conduct by the coup government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation in the evening with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities of carrying out this transfer are not met, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane returned to its home, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
The coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad to grant him safe-conduct.
But the deposed president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as a visiting head of state.
The putschist government "has experienced another failure in wanting me to resign (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, about which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing a few chords the deposed president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for safe driving, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
“I am not asking for asylum from any country,” Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is headquartered in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be made as president of the Honduran people, he had stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president on Wednesday, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced its headquarters.
Brazil’s Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government’s stance.
This demonstrates the marginal character of this government in relation to international norms, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on 21 September and took refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" of which he is accused by the justice, according to the coup government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in holding a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted en masse against Zelaya’s return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with the U.S. trade balance figures reflecting the recovery of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones rose 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technology-dominant Nasdaq rose 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
“We have good news coming from different parts of the economy,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, estimating that the market was focusing on “half-full glass.”
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors have mostly focused on U.S. trade balance figures, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected an increase in the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth in the economies of major U.S. trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States rose against all odds last week, to 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest level in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday evening and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power composing the "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday conspired against the wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were spit on the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist found.
Down the Yankees!, “mercenaries!”, “the street belongs to the revolutionaries!”, “Long live Fidel and Raul!” shouted the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by officers in plainclothes who came to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by police officers in plainclothes, an AFP journalist found.
Police forcibly mounted dissidents in civilian vehicles that were conspired by government supporters, according to the journalist.
The arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain under lock and key.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be “mercenaries” or “agents” on the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forcené kills an octogenarian with a knife and injures 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A gunman armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and injured five others in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), an hour ahead of the crowd, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the assailant, 28 years old, struck with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy at 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses learned.
Severely injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or outside the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian died.
The days of the other wounded are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became uneasy and was reportedly hospitalized “in shock,” according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
He allegedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter seriously.
The script was confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried in a cross behind his back, explained on the spot an official of the union Alliance in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the forceful.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was strong, Alberto, a bartender at a nearby bar, reported.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their official, attempted to arrest the gunman and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers-by came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person in his 30s arrived, wounded with a knife.
National police officers arrested the man without identity papers.
The prosecutor's office of Nanterre has referred the investigation to the departmental service of judicial police of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in custody.
A police source did not rule out his being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the forceful of this species whose forces increase tenfold under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again demands abandonment of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of the prosecution against his client, currently placed under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the director's lawyer, denounced three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal for serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977.
I call for the charges to be dropped here and now, Hummel said, adding that the behavior of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, was "cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- discussed, before issuing his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which constitutes a serious misconduct.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" by the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
At the end of September, Wells said he had "lie" to the documentary's author.
In the event that the court refused to drop the prosecution, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was handed down, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never returned to the United States since.
Los Angeles County Assistant Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama said Polanski “must be there to appear at the hearing.”
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to flee?
For her, the filmmaker "requests a favor from the court, while disregarding his authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed "there are other alternatives to flight."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the abandonment of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, has also called once again for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client can no longer bear to be harassed at every turn in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a US arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his Gstaad cottage, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, slowed by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market torn between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“Honestly, the market is very quiet,” said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped improve market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery," analysts at Charles Schwab summed up.
In the U.S., retail sales grew 1.3 percent in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also recovered sharply in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary index estimate.
The indexes, however, were held back by a new rise in the dollar, at the highest level in two months against the euro, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
As a result, technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of traveling across South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title are preparing to cross Saturday the last straight line to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great beauty mass organized for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino de Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
“I’ve seen so many things and had so many experiences,” exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, stresses Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and is running for president, as well as Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It’s every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown,” Miss India said with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will march in traditional costume and of course in swimsuit.
The show will be hosted by a TV presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates have like last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
They also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been dating people I never thought I'd be able to get close to.
I will undoubtedly return for the 2010 World Cup, excites Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive", according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," his son David said Friday upon arrival at the Los Angeles airport where he was due to go to his father's bedside hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it is going very well, said David Hallyday on his departure from the plane that was bringing him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local (21:00 GMT).
The singer's relaxed-looking son said he was going "quickly" to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following a herniated disc surgery on Nov. 26 in Paris.
The singer was “placed in an artificial coma last night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment,” the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had previously been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reopened on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is attending a school show, an AFP photographer found.
The head of orthopaedic and trauma surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
“I’ve heard of a possible legal proceeding to come,” he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday had "departed far too quickly for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this in-person doctor online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it amazed me, given that I had two herniated discs myself, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer had apparently "departed without drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulfurous reputation, repeatedly convicted by the courts, in medical liability cases, as well as for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr David Koubbi.
He said the procedure had gone "perfectly well" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have been multiplying since this summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ed) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association raises the tone and adds the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the bid attempt of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardin party, urging him not to use it on any support, under penalty of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after reaching out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP passed to the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand for having been the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to be dispossessed, came out of its silence to launch a letter of formal notice to the minister and the deputy, advising them not to use the acronym and to pass on ownership of the brand, under penalty of legal proceedings.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you would propose to your political movement to "retake" the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist Alliance.
You also thought it good to have the name of this movement, the "New Centre", the slogan "Today's UDF", posted on your militant material and on the front page of your site, also note the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office, which urges the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to pass on the ownership of (the) mark to its legitimate successors."
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF "is a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has, in their view, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office charged with defending "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He outrageously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of filing the acronym UDF to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for yourself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as accused by the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian to rob her of part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th correctional chamber also ordered that a medical assessment of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted collegiately by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating in particular if Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a weak state and at what periods.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'm going to talk to him about it," Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court’s decision.
This is excellent news (...) Expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who must be protected, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed criminal charges against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who she accuses of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleas sometimes turned to the big family unpacking on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
“Françoise, I haven’t been able to talk to her since her marriage.”
For its part, the Nanterre prosecutor's office again ruled that the complainant was inadmissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge refused in recent days to grant her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said prosecutor Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court ultimately decided that it would rule once the trial took place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees, recalls the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it was once, to impose on consumers products thought by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquest of the markets back in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the factors of customer preferences regularly returns!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously jeopardizes the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular R&D and, even more, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that the revenues of authoritarian management totally contradict.
That is why we are calling for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the center of the company’s concerns on the same footing as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incite this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First, because I have been able to see that, in the face of a new situation, every structure finally manages, after many detours, to do priority... what it has always done.!
Second, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Coming from the great schools of engineering, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, out of intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the engagement of executives, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr comforts leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, inappropriate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies requires adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or governance practice, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realizing part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motivational Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "in place".
They thus create a favourable terrain for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: 'Just War' Worth Right-Wing Praise to Obama
The American right has welcomed the speech delivered the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had brocaded the award for Mr. Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, a figurehead in the right wing of the Republican Party, to USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the "sometimes necessary" theme of war in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is of course the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped all over there, she said.
Obama, who inherited his predecessor George W. Bush's two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential remark.
On some sides, I found this speech quite historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former president, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush columnist and Washington Post columnist, Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world” as “he always does,” he “spoke like an American president,” reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they haven’t created and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "dull, blistering and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When one wraps war in the notion of justice, one can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained commendable to the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "overproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California daily said.
Obama “pronounced the right speech,” the New York Times said, calling him “both dark and uplifting.”
Routiers: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon-negotiation sessions, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organization to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ends the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" about this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of talks, the negotiators left early on Friday, hoping to sign the agreement early in the morning.
And this even if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked on the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting that began at 11:00 a.m. for everyone to agree and the text to be signed by 6:00 p.m.
The conflict “would have been very detrimental to businesses” and “there was a fear that it would disrupt the holidays,” Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rate, for low-wages, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're starting from very far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we will give the order to our activists that there are no blockades, no blockades of the supply centers.
But we can always have some recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, hailed "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases on high wages given international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) called for an “acceptable compromise”.
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel costs by 3%, and the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros in employers' charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "in identical terms".
The signature of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies that are members of this organization, and secondly, to the entire profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "market of fools", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, deplored the Unostra.
For the Other, the agreement risks "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, unions unhappy with the proposals of the RATP
The disruptions on the RER A, France's largest urban public transit line, will continue over the weekend, as a meeting on Friday on the second day of strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry for their demand for premiums.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10am and 8pm, at the rate of one train in two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train in four outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is making efforts to serve department stores".
The RER A crosses from the west to the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train out of two operated during peak hours, and almost no trains during off-peak hours, as expected.
As on Thursday, there was no hustle and bustle on the docks, the Francilians having organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, in particular due to the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, said he woke up "an hour and a half earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, the SNCF said, which had planned a supervision of officers and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare station to reach the subways.
New strikers' general assemblies will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, deemed "slim" by the unions, of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its proposals for premiums in parentheses, the CGT was indignant, stressing that the management "was not doomed to solve a problem when in the road users and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday to "a broader examination of the conditions for the practice of the profession," the RATP said.
This also made the unions say that the company "mocked the weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the leadership, which had previously refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "for the sake of appeasement".
The conflict threatens to widen to the RER B on Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain of the degradation of working conditions on this line to the million daily travelers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for shifted hours, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Justice Dissolves Pro-Kurdish Party, Decision With Consequences
Turkey’s Constitutional Court on Friday ruled the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry outbursts in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "focus of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the court, Hasim Kiliç, told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's cadres, including its chairman Ahmet Türk and lawmaker Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity for Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled MPs.
The decision follows a 2007 case by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, says it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, in an attempt to dry up Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to a rise in tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous protests against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have escalated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice was announced, a thousand protesters gathered outside the DTP's premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the southeast mostly populated by Kurds.
Police fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots.
A hundred people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deepen despair.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by banning a party, he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of parties.
That doesn’t solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall.
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very harsh winter.
But the head of the clearing and sandblasting service of the roads (FES) makes clear that it is not to annoy the citizens.
This is simply so that the agents can test the technique of the vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the meteorologists, it could be for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle snow and ice.
The EDF follows a very elaborate plan.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel along 20 main routes (called routes A).
This includes high-traffic streets, major arteries, such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
EDF officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of road must be salted with a road fondant that adheres well, in a maximum of 3 hours.
This is why the EDF service starts at 3am "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic begins".
Where it gets harder is when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the clearing and sandblasting service of the roads "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it does not snow, we take care of access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary lanes and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger is well aware that this always causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the EDF pedestrian team set out to first clear areas deemed hazardous and crossings.
As for cycle paths, the EDF services are generally unable to deal with them.
Mr. Brauburger said that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4.30 a.m.
As ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also use this special service for snacks when needed.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long by 1.50m tall, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp, curved teeth, its short arms ended in sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues report in Thursday’s Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological features.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the landmass of the supercontinent, Pangaea, and was near the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa illuminates a new day in the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the kinship links, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and member of the excavation team says that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating back to the Triassic.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
Excavations have found the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories regarding the early evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indian word for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontologists share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it confirms some theories regarding the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the earliest dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the saurians were divided into three major groups of evolution: the theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaur and the velociraptor which appeared later and from which descend the birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds with long necks, and those related to them and the herbivores ornithischians such as the particiens.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the earliest theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found clues that suggest that the Tawa hallae possessed small air sacs in its bones at the level of the skull, just like birds that are the descendants of theropods.
These small pockets of air make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
As the related lineage of the huge sauropods also possessed aerial sacs and a light frame, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major evolutionary lines split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e., all of the landmasses that formed the supercontinent Pangaea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists has also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
All three species cannot be descended from a common ancestor who migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the silesaur, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a mistaken view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapod of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptilian branch, remains a mystery today.
In Triassic times, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of modern crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread throughout the planet thus favoring the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
Such a success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a mass extinction to which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles reportedly went extinct.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favored the flourishing of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and that since that time had been vegetating in the shadows: these were mammals.
Vienna Solidarity in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec City, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the J.W. Goethe University casino in Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and professors from J.W. Goethe University and other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe, North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemned the police intervention demanded by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the President of the Werner Müller-Estler University had the buildings occupied by the students and teachers on strike evacuated after walls and works of art were smeared with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the degradation did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own classes".
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable violation" of freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and tries to make the reasons for the mobilization forgotten.
The University Steering Committee thus avoided the debates that would be necessary.
Lecturers demand that the criminal prosecution be immediately suspended.
The majority of occupants did not take part in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union of the service sector and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took the case for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the regional parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday during the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but we do not accept vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a CDU member of the regional parliament.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of reflecting on the arguments and demands of the students, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion that summons the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The new “Silicon-Valley”
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
There are important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics.
As early as September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, the location of the Frankfurt sciences – with academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of close collaboration".
The signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will leave for Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the rapidly expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific societies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
It is home to the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for armaments research.
Zelenograd (literally “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For his supporters it is nothing less than “the new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The end-of-line railway stations, with tracks that ended in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the transport technique of the nineteenth century that acted as a brake pad of modern railway traffic because it took a long time to move the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you have to do.
This is why the head-of-line stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a railway station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Magistral Railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
Actually, the head-of-line stations no longer pose genuine problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with autorails and driver car at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched alongside the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies have prevailed.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who bears the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public company.
From an urban point of view this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphics of the computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the section's enlargement are designed for human trafficking, which was attributed - and is typical of the 1980s - to enormous growth.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on increasing freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official number.
Experts think 10 to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will be missing for other junction points and congestion in the network.
The Ministry of Transportation lists a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley by 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the fungus down here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking hoof.
The Rhine Valley route is on track to become a bottleneck for international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
Government Examines Airport Judgment
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government raised the possibility of appealing the Hessian Administrative Court's ruling on the prohibition of overnight flights.
Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine the Administrative Tribunal's ruling from a legal point of view, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event that the proposed construction of the north-western runway of Frankfurt Airport would take place.
Authorisation to land 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 if it wants to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises this delay and tries to pressure the government representative to dismiss the appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, calls on the CDU and the FDP to return to their pre-election promise to ban night flights, otherwise it will be considered a total breach of a given word.
It’s damn hard to be allowed to keep his word, said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP’s election slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's reproaches that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights using "avocado and rubble".
It takes time to carry out an accurate legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "quick first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its faction's statements on the ban on night flights is completely misguided.
U.S. Banks Repay Allocated Aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, are losing their ties to the state.
Bank of America said on Wednesday it had fully reimbursed the Treasury for $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
U.S. television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid it received.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses allocated to managers as well as the payment of higher fees.
Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The remainder of the sum comes from the bank's cash registers, which are well filled thanks to the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the CEO of Bank of America, expressly thanked the American taxpayers: the capital injection has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capabilities by buying out investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup also plans to obtain money from the financial markets in order to free itself from state tutelage.
The U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase as early as Thursday, CNBC reported, citing banking circles.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not want to comment on the information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had reimbursed the public funds they had received.
Accelerated Election
In the end, everything happened faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs ZDF’s Berlin-based newsroom, was the big favorite.
The channel, however, did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a willingness not to further harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter’s candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had voted in favour of the reappointment of Brender, and seven others had voted against it.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already hinted several weeks before the vote, not wanting to return Brender to his position.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly regarded editor-in-chief on the grounds that the rate of listening to ZDF news broadcasts had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, blasting the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 public law experts who had meddled in the debate and felt that Koch’s way of acting was unconstitutional.
But that would have been useless.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked for the Südwestfunk (radio organ of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily newspaper of national scope).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF first of all in the news magazine "heute-journal" (newspaper of today).
Then his career continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimonthly information program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the berlin editorial staff.
After Brender’s disgrace, while he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialist magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch’s opponent on the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Minister-President Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck did not consider requesting the removal of political figures from the supervisory commissions of the ZDF.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had cleverly maneuvered with the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political partisan in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of parties, Frey is classified as left-liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was reached stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the exams: a single exam should allow the chosen study module to be completed.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder are also committed to organising more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor's and Master's programmes.
At regional level, there must be no different regulations from one Land to another.
Fewer exams
Since the start of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have always had in their mouths the fashionable expression: "studyability".
But for the first time, this phrase seems to take on concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module must normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", can be read in a document of about thirty pages on the future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop the slippage, which was significantly detrimental to studyability.
In addition, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if one can not avoid this feeling of suffocation that one sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the room for manoeuvre to enable and foster personal initiative".
The new regulations will concern access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "re-accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is not until 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which depend on the accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put a certain amount of pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes would not be too heavy and the examination regime not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialised colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is thus far the only state to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs and strengthen the educational guidance offices as well as the examination offices and the international relations department.
The Länder and universities are allocating a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million for this.
In early 2010, the government wants to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
After this, only one exam will be required to complete his studies.
The organisation of studies must be more flexible, the recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions must be guaranteed and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the question of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but criticism was heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has indicated that he would like that the organization of educational policy no longer take place "behind the closed doors" of ministers and rectors of universities.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as affected persons should be able to express themselves a little bit.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of the students is very useful to us", she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a common reform project.
For the union of education and science (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduate to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the steering committee of the GEW, also asks that the Länder assure today's Bachelor students that there will be enough places for Master studies and as good study conditions as possible tomorrow.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that a work of the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in fragments of disturbing phrases, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who won freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later a collection manager in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm artist house in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow German-Romanian writers Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received the German Language Award in 1989 together with some of the participants.
Recruitment trials had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, "so someone who has not been able to resist sufficiently the attempts of intimidation of the Securitate".
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary untangling with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors originating in Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abysses and the baseness of a political system, based on police surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own file Securitate, IM Walter played a role, says literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He was able to pull it out of all the difficult situations at the time,” Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this public was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculations and sometimes have guessed what real names were hiding last the loan names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where in the meantime consultation of Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confusing.
Systematic clarification has been thwarted and restrained over the past few years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has rather dragged on since.
Since 2005, there has been a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former official of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she had only been questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many unavoidable questions are associated with the Söllner case as so often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
The weighted reaction of the listeners, to Söllner's admission, leaves hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received yesterday the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Champions League riots
It felt like a representative was arriving there, pulled four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread its merchandise when the new VFB coach Christian Gross climbed at midnight minus the quarter in a C-class Mercedes, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, let himself be led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our fiftieth-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drunk alcohol and was not drunk with happiness.
It had been a pleasant evening but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
Because it was now that it was going to start.
The words of the Swiss that we had just started three days earlier were clear: "We reached the eighth of finals well", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight to not fall back".
The “big job” awaits us on Sunday.
There, it is a question of repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that resurfaced after the three expeditious goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Lottery draw
The eighth round of the Champions League (one-way match 16./17. + 23./24 February/return match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn by lot on 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant entry into office of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only in the one who had brought luck, who had transmitted to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the “soul plumber” – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so well but that no longer worked with the healer Babbel.
It triggered a certain magic, Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann confessed, "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes things happen that one would never have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of injury breaks, advanced to the rank of best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" noted by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the new leader's working method: "It's someone who goes into action and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet crossed the line, manager Horst Heldt warned
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won at Glasgow before having four days later a bad awakening at Leverkusen with the 0:4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still a long way off.
We haven't gotten through the hard road yet.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday didn’t have the heart to party, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the weekend’s events that a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made him bounce back just before the match began.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt would thwart, in response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He accused the management of style weakness and said she had decided to change coaches under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the games had been removed.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness", Heldt said and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked becoming friends for life these two forty-year-olds.
In any cast, they agreed for everything else, that is to say that without the previous work of the group by the replaced coach, the strong sports and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for a large part in the success,” replied Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the man with the plastic bag nodded.
World Heavy Duty Championships
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger was constantly provoking the world champion Vitali Klitschko verbally and gesturally.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of World Heavyweight Champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
The judges were unanimous in imposing the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a point victory in the unanimity of the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honor since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won the title of World Champion of the WBO and WBC federations twice.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, a 39-time winner in 41 professional bouts, had to admit twice his loss due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his left.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the shots of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko to bring into play his dangerous counter-right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his blows seldom reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, to have exceeded with Klitschko the distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insults Klitschko by calling him a "bad zombie" who "isn't really capable".
During Friday's weigh-in, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of nearly four years, he beat Nigerien Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and retrieved "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a shot in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said, explaining his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It seems that his promotional company is now considering playing the match at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz affair
Frontal opposition attack: The head of the Greens' parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defence Minister Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the Left parties ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing some facts.
The minister has intentionally "formulated a falsehood" about the deadly strike of two tankers last September, the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, said on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the 8 p.m. newspaper).
In other words, it means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, in essence, the content of the report that NATO has at its disposal and that was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the aim of the strike was actually not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the US airstrike that was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak out as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan government's policy and whether the Chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have endorsed this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancery has in no way influenced military interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were growing to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given Guttenberg about the attack on the tanker trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they allegedly concealed the existence of the NATO report and concealed some embarrassing details from the Minister.
However, the entourage of the two senior officials suggests that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had in the meantime requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the ministry declined to comment on the allegations and referred them to the Federal Parliamentary Inquiry Committee, which was set up the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can indulge unhindered in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, one who, awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychic patients or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, at best it is called visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect are distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain – primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and aketylcholine – is broken and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often manifest themselves during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The earthly force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreaming.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakened dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dreaming", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It's fall 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
His body is in two dimensions with screaming colors.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over him, he hovers at the edge of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him winged devil creatures, grinning, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Voices thundering, mean, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo, makes it a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop is detached.
Let it be a lesson to you, shout the voices in a chorus to tear off his eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last dating from 2 years, the first from nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenic crisis, the people concerned can no longer tell the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyperexcitation, which can cause them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter out disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Just like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the University of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust the reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in your life.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the lived takes place in a real framework.
Why our brains make these kinds of cabrioles, is still an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause anyone to lose momentarily their perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that those affected have minimal brain damage.
It is assumed that the brain’s neural maturation is disrupted at an early stage of development by, for example, a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the neuronal system anomaly occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains are warm.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Heads".
Hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising to find that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admitted to having experienced hallucination at least once in their life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attending high school.
A girl to do everything normal to say the truth.
If there weren't the images and the voices.
During the recess, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, addresses the word to him.
When she answers, her comrades look at her, amazed – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, she is sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to her on the bench.
She may even feel his presence momentarily.
It is a pleasant feeling, she finds this young sympathetic.
Am I crazy? she asks herself sometimes.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are usually frightening.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, it happens that she cannot attend the class because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the board.
At night the apparitions are usually frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grinning faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she cries out to these creatures.
She doesn't tell her parents or her friends about it, they'd take her for a madwoman.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her high school last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she got in touch with psychologist Kasten on the internet, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the likelihood is high that they will have hallucinations after a while.
I guess the brain's not busy enough, so there's some animation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of thirteen that the man she called dad, since she was of thinking age, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step between dreaming and hallucinating.
In our world too focused on consciousness we unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of the modification of the awakened consciousness by the dream.
The oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is in a state of awakening.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dreaming and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity that is given to us men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich-born art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Changement de c<0xC5><0x93>ur" as an action to save the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time his conscious leaves for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen immerses himself in a world he created from scratch, visiting foreign places, traveling in time. He sees himself as an old man lying in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages among nobles who made blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the neve of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He absorbs himself completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes, describing what he has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience makes the horizon of our other daily experiences burst, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snow can fall.
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda Publishing is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly resolved to join society, Hubert Burda, 69, told the Spiegel.
All the details were settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise afterwards.
We will also have to see if they are capable of it.
We cannot impose our children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the position of Chairman and CEO in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently, he was responsible for the Treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the company's capital, and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus, for the first time, it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old respectively, his son Felix, who would have been 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves as a link for the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda points out that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families who have let themselves be carried away by a bulimia of capital, who have made enormous unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That has never been my strategy.
“I have never had a dream of universal power,” Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself in the role of preceptor of the country as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can wish for, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the goal that seems to have set itself El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the Callao shopping center (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a session of jacuzzi, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (warming and stretching included), are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And if after working our body, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer hair repair rituals, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various Necklaces
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona to buy electric cars
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, has created the “LIVE Oficina”.
It is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will implement agreements regarding mobility, making steps, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the implementation of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa is involved in with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a number of complementary projects underway such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquility" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, foreshadows "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year in order to support the automotive sector.
"Without an Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
“Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), has dedicated 800 million euros to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized an investment of more than 3 000 million euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was aimed at both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures to support demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in Spain by 6% and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of collectible cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Motor Show, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the world of motoring.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.

Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, complements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collectible engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in automotive sales, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sales and restoration of automobiles, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor Aptitude Test
But the trade show’s business activity will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sporting exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Aptitude tests with collectible automobiles and motorcycles will also be held on a circuit set up outside the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sporting spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sporty spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the stop and start system of the engine, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for now, is available only on the 2.0 petrol engine of 150 horsepower.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good grade it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting from the driver’s seat, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
This is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the interior, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large chest with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for now, is only available on the two-litre, 150-horsepower gasoline engine and with manual six-speed transmission.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most demanded Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, in other words the one with the largest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipments, the lane change assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, the independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio are particularly noteworthy.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes, among other elements, adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc loader.
Concluding
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is illustrated in particular by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150 hp 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us every day a great dose of satisfaction.
The “First” of Luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our “Pe”, as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark “lady”.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to look at his email, without offering the possibility even to see certain type of attachments or to browse the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is as limited as his American grandbrother, but comes with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or to desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly appealing and it should have worked for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as for me, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
The European Commission’s repeated reminders to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside of his country of origin, we are hesitant to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have the Wifi) offers this type of rates, means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals allowing them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other Internet research.
No subscription and no galley.
It is a connected device and you pay when you buy it, not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a lifelong access purchase option like Peek already offers in the US.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I simply want it because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she did indeed choose the same to accompany him in the second, undoubtedly the most important moment of her life: the delivery in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
At first glance, it seems that the first lady of the United States follows in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to wear the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the taking of office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heels for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised while she wore it loose the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for young generation women who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fertility and professional career of women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have had their careers limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of employment occupied.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, get into a relationship earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women in stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are pushing back on entry into couple life and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women aged 35-49 with fixed employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after moving in as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the date of start of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who had completed elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at an average of 25.1 and 32.1 years of age, respectively.
“Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child, "says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several of the brand’s products, chanting the universal motto “Because I’m worth it”.
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities listed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club so select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
Prices of British Fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, from yesterday and today, gathered for the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Model of the Year.
The Ass Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither fear nor enlightenment.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an emotional invitation to reading and rereading.
I leave you here a few snapshots.
In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same one I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.
Samuel Beckett: Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between helplessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him.
On Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven by the way of perdition.”
On James Joyce: “The Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed on the north face, on which the best mountaineers are letting go again and again.”
About William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landlord of the county and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry its echo to the depths of the night of the twentieth century, in its literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking posterity with a violent discourse to the seagulls."
Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed, ‘Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.’”
On Joseph Conrad: “On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: “Sleep after effort, / after the storm the port, / rest after the war, / after life, tired death delights.”
About Virginia Wolf: “She was carrying her depressions in her baggage too.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told him that Edward VII spied on her between the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent exceeded madness.
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it was not to try to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What is Benet trying to do but to have Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What has this done but to seek the glory of this man, that he might serve him as a pedestal?
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a mole, rescued from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they gave her two kicks that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is fun to attack free of charge a small animal defenseless that, in addition, was on a leash.
We must add to this the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than himself.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog moaned all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint with the police station in the neighbourhood, although we doubt that this is useful for much, and in order not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly assassins were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what happens to young people so that they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where the right education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for wearing the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond designing and manufacturing ever safer products” and said it contributed to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet on two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to guarantee the widest diffusion.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products that are always safer.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are growing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
The good news, however, should be nuanced, since the reference for comparison, November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the upturn last month, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles that fall into the light commercial vehicle category (passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) are added, 95,853 have been sold.
The large clouds that most affect their demand have not dissipated because, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized companies, which pay almost 100% of the time through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the constraints implied by the limitation of bank credits, other factors must be added such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In the face of this situation and unlike passenger vehicles, aid for the purchase of the 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, freelancers and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) was once again recalled.
The dealers association foresees a year 2010 similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a shortage period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by car components manufacturer Bosch, one-third of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of its full strength.
Up to 1100 accidents
The intervention of the help, in revenge, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum stress on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors Postpones Opel Plan to January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will be launched during the first week of April – probably on the 8th –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
In contrast, at GM, it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
In the event that there was no agreement with either of them, GM could sell a share of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last precious jewel, Porsche engineers started the Boxster S and managed to thin it from just under 80 kilos, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilos.
This has led them to move, in the first place, from the automatic roof that has been replaced by a manual tarpaulin roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos of gains, to mount 12 bags of sports.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms and replacing the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK gearbox, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on roads in California’s mountain secondary network, with particularly winding corners.
His behavior can only be described as irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from riding on the ground with ease.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we tested such a small and lightweight model that, at the same time, guarantees so much safety in corners, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at low speed for the necessary time, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is what we wanted. Thanks to its steering, as communicative as accurate, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is abrupt, whether at standstill or during recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The lining of the roads we covered with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the potholes well.
The electronic assistants barely showed up all the way, while on some corners we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-light, fun-to-drive car that is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the fashion shows of the house, the singer displays her face of a bad girl with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a “bad girl” or a “it girl”, it is a “bag girl”.
Baskonia wins in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the hard terrain of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. She is thus at the head of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets three points was the best of his team (29 of evaluation).
Vitoria’s team managed to fill Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov’s significant absences with a great deal of commitment and collective work, even though they had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on Israeli ground with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barak's inner play and Eliyahu's work, which was received by cheers and applause back to his old home, to increase their lead at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "less six" rating already presaged that this night was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the team of Avala wanted to remind the one of Vitoria that we do not win so easily on their field, and thanks to "the hand of Elias", they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellows taking the lead over the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed to follow up some clever actions to get the air, and it was at this moment that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged who, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas' third quarter, gave the counter-67 to a reassuring score at home (54).
Avala's team came out to play all for all in the final period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they were not going to let anyone take what they deserved in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign themselves and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
The Unicaja lost noisily in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the lead of Group B of the Euroleague, during a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or the size of the rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter, made the Andalusians dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the home game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, at which time an action, a start of fight, between the North American leaders both Beverley and Williams have trained the
The Greek team began to operate by showing their superiority on both sides, as the injury exit of English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez weighed on Unicaja.
The domestic players and Lithuanian wingman Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the advantage 44-32, in the nineteenth minute.
An Impossible Rise
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos, which, despite losing 19 times, was superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match at Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, causing the head of the group to shake.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But winning was practically impossible as Olympiacos was relentless when players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of real estate, job and vehicle listings in Spain.
The “How much should you get paid?” tool calculates users’ salaries from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you need to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week that the application has been working, the search engine has detected that as a rule, the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement the head of products of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovità from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, while a Spaniard receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid job in Spain is as a waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year, followed by a salesman, with 14,725 euros, and a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president must abandon the diplomatic legation by January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his term.
Francisco Catunda, the businessman of the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his mandate, he must look for another destination.”
The channel also quoted the former official, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After rosy days since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant rating in the markets, uncertainty emerges again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future that is by nature uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalized and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, are starting to put some sand in the cogs, as did the ECB, with their one-year auction next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are rising again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
There is once again a flight towards quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the havens chosen by investors, causing a widening of the differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad for silencing moral risk advocates, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for global economic policy that had restrained the destructive effects derived from the credit limitation on the destruction of employment, when what would have to be done is decree a new day of grace.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to give back its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area country to fail to meet its commitments.
On the other hand, what makes sense is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we find ourselves facing an episode of normalization of transient risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our gaps in public debt increase to the extent of European corporate bonds, we do not have to worry.
If European gaps narrowed and ours continued to increase, it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote: when our forecasting indicators force most survey services to anticipate their stimulus models and revise upwards their 2011 forecasts, with the OECD and the European Commission also coming back to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not augur much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems like an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "prudence is the mother of safety".
Connected sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán outlined for the press what he had mentioned before the sub-committee, eight-closed.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion until 2020 and an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion between that date and 2030, in the event that the nuclear power plants currently in operation remain open.
If this were not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue is changing, and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, along with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes the government’s recently approved Sustainable Economy Bill is in line with his company’s demands, has declined to attack the royal decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts policies to fight global warming.
According to him, there is a “clear long-term bet” in this sense, despite the “one-off” measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are long-term, should begin to be made, as they take some time before reaching maturity and a stable remunerative framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground-based airport services, will act as the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it operates.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a five-year term.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance plans an investment of $20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona contests its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The project is a tunnel estimated at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway concessionaire.
The City Council hopes to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the tutelage of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their offers next May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia are competing, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company to operate smoothly, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of Australia’s largest manufacturers, while the latter, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s leading specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is founded, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specialized in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction sites and privatizations, but getting into them is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains a step not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has just gained a foothold in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona relies on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The Toll Underground, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link (northern link), is intended to connect the Toowong Western Highway to the ring road at Kelvin Grove (see map) by 4 kilometres of tunnel, the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide A$500 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make a large profit from Hochtief, who yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fiber optic broadband network.
This will provide 400,000 people with fast internet access and provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has sold the 27-story King George Tower project in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been charged with the work of enlargement of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The construction is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded the publicity of Renfe
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs. Rushmore was chosen from among 16 agencies that submitted to the tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA which was responsible for creativity over the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and loyalty programmes to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state-owned company, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore recidivist.
An application store
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company followed in the footsteps of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from the transmission of voice.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their Champions League participation has earned Real Madrid and Barça $476.4 million since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona won 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth position of the clubs that pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated 5 362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) that have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third in the continent to make the most money for his participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, even though they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of the money brought in by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution (distribution)
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini expects to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this sum, UEFA will allocate <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the qualifying matches (among which Atlético de Madrid) received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, in addition to 550 000 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and tie (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the round of 16 receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, as a fixed payment, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and at most 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are dedicated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four assigned places.
The champion of the previous year pockets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% of SOS.
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday listed the details of the offer to buy shares through which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public offering (POA) for all securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be remunerated at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended at 1.85 euros; the offer of Nueva Rumasa therefore evaluates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of SOS.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives the shareholders 15 days to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>611.7 million, while the capital of SOS is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of potential bids and judicial back and forth from her former directors, the Jesús brothers and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
This made her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the chairman of the group.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million SOS to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months SOS will reveal new embezzlements cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the Salazar loan, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) declared yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the embezzlement of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV authorizes the Bid of exclusion of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday approved the exclusion bid presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The oversight body explained that it authorized this transaction because it understood that its terms were in accordance with the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet submitted, following the amendments applied on December 2, to be "sufficient".
The CNMV specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the share capital, composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It has further explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, and that they could not in any way be transmitted before the finalization of the offer, of which it has indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the norms in force.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of automobiles that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30,000, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Providers of services and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of assessment tools and information development on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model is created on which the different parts of a passenger car can be clicked.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process proceeds very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have for example information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghinis.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most common application is for repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing breakage parts or calculating the residual or venal value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, with the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claims assessment solution for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertises, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it was removed from the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared wrecks.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious claims for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also aimed at experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for claims assessment, breakdowns or car maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, and it made a turnover of 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
Solera Group’s global turnover (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was publicly traded for $1 billion, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auction of accidented cars
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, brokers and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collectible cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Four-step garage quotation
With the Auda-Workshop tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then he can print the quote to deliver it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one intended for garages does not include the estimated labor time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the Audatex company is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to see the inner face.
