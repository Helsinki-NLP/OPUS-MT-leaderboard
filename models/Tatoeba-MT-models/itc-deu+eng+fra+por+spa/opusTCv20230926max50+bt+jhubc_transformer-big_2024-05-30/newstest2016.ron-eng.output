UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the conflict that has lasted for nearly five years and more weapons would only worsen the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet this month with foreign ministers from five countries permanently present in the council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban said he regretted that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this situation unresolved".
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity shown when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 Figures In Polls That Show Donald Trump Has Real Chances
Some have tried to label him a “flip-flop” politician.
Others called it a joke.
Others are waiting for implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to knock Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it hasn’t worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads with a two-digit percentage and some voices are beginning to seriously question what this means for the real estate mogul’s chances of appointment.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits point out that, at the same time in 2011, Rick Perry's lead was making way for Herman Cain in polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would fight hard in the general elections are numerous.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic club for growth admit Trump’s power and begin to support him with money.
Below we present some figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just something transient:
The numbers indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two in 10 Republicans had a positive opinion of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Six out of 10 Republicans have a positive opinion of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60 percent of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for the nomination.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only two in 10 say they would be “upset” if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be “enthusiastic” compared to 40% who say the same about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “unsatisfied” or “upset” if the favorite Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted by the ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
We find the same figures in the state of Iowa, where all 52% of Republicans believe that Trump has the right personality to be leader, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44 percent say they don’t have the personality to act effectively and nearly six in 10 independents say their temperament isn’t in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, when asked who has the most chances to win the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed since late July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: In the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for the nomination, compared with only 28% for Mitt Romney.
But these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans have backed down to another candidate, Trump is still at the forefront of everyone.
Some voices say the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while support against Trump will be divided among more than a dozen candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points behind Carly Fiorina, 14 points behind Marco Rubio, 15 points behind Walker, 19 points behind Jeb Bush and 33 points behind Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's almost on par with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to defeat him?
Ben Carson would defeat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one showdown.
The majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have decided.
A new poll conducted by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their minds.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump’s biggest opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but he’s twice as likely as voters who say they’ve decided to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the central theme of his 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombshell style will lead to a split between major Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and undermine rebranding efforts.
But according to the ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
The frustration with the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now backed by nearly half of Republican voters, largely because of their status as outsiders.
According to the ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A two-week survey in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the performance of Congressional Republicans, with 54 percent declaring themselves “unhappy” and 21 percent “nervous at the top.”
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut at the PMQs has been long awaited
Labour's new leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely scrutinised by the media and Labour parliamentarians.
In his weekly appearances, he called for "less theatre and more facts".
He also said that he can give up a few participations and give them up to his colleagues.
The showdown will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in a leadership position, coming after he appointed a "ghost cabinet" and after his speech at Tuesday's annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to remain silent about the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain drew criticism from Conservative lawmakers and made headlines.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesman for Corbyn said he "respectfully kept silent" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended the Labour leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the shadow cabinet refused to join Mr Corbyn's lead team, arguing for differences of opinion on economics, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says the policy differences "came together" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment on his stance towards the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Minister of Labor and Pensions, said the party was “very clear” in exclusive opposition to the government’s plans to reduce the “head” level from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced on the rostrum in the last decade since he took over the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas “from outside sources” for questions to ask Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
MP Islington North said the PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and will refrain from aftershocks and attacks, pledging instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the finance minister, would take his place at the PMQs when he can't attend - for example when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying that he had approached the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over, Cameron said he wanted to give up the "Punch and Judy" political style often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he runs the Chamber of Deputies, and his position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics say it has become a caricature and needs a deep reformation.
"Framework in Joburg": Young homeless people benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as children found a way to learn a job and earn a living.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas where they live and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Harm Expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says a minimum wage increase in the UK could mean “greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But that purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs in the firm, he says.
The costs could impact JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the “storm” created around her friend, Nick Kyrgios, and her behavior deserves praise rather than criticism, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by Kyrgios' outrageous slippage of Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a tough qualifying match played shortly after in Cincinnati, the referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said, "Wawrinka should have grounded Kyrgios."
Although he was last seen making a rocket dust after having muscle cramps and missed a possible U.S. Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second place in the singles, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
“One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little bit drawn into the conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because of cramps in the US, but he’s not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But let’s face it, he’s done extremely well in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He has a great team, he has a great family by his side and I think he was treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, works hard and has integrated into the team, has had no conflict with the other players, is very respected in the locker room, trains hard, is in excellent shape, is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged exclusively on the basis of his qualities and flaws.
Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the major draw match, which begins Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the long-term return of the Canberra native to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw match and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick climbed very fast, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he grows up before the eyes of the public and he made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions for the team and I think he needs a time in which he is not in the center of attention.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton’s lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now backed by 47 percent of Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second at 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is backed by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are firmer in their choice than the supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the poll conducted by CBS news last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has shrunk.
Men’s support has declined considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton’s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now on par with Sanders.
However, Clinton is still at the forefront of older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit percentage among liberals, but Sanders now has a slight five-point lead in that group.
About half of Democratic national voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she was elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton’s current supporters will be enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton — only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about top-ranked Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question as to why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it is time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
Agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential run, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race – although a third believe he shouldn’t be running.
When asked about the second option for the party’s representative, Democratic voters appoint Biden as a majority.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he doesn’t run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the highest chance of winning the general election; but the figures fell from 78% last month.
Biden is second but the percentage that is most eligible has risen.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer problems over eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as the party’s representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform well in some key characteristics compared to their party’s primary voters.
Most voters see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as integrity, trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen as the best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton’s strong point is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democrats don’t believe Clinton is integrity and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% don’t have an opinion about him.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as them.
On all of these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and server when she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it has not affected their general opinion of the candidate.
The situation is different for the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only nearly a third are satisfied.
Public opinion split on the issue in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy hasn’t affected their overall opinion of Clinton, though 36% say they’ve changed their minds negatively.
Most Republicans, more than six in 10, say they have changed their view of Clinton negatively.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton to be integrity and trustworthy, this continues to raise issues among voters overall: only 32% consider her to be integrity and trustworthy, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider her integrity and trustworthiness.
At the same time, 55 percent of national voters do not consider Trump to be integrity and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in integrity.
The number of people who consider Sanders to be integer is greater than those who do not agree with him, but as with Carson, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democrat voters is 6 percentage points.
Five Brotherhood Members Charged With Year 1 Murder at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed taking him to hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, a 14-kilogram backpack filled with sand was put on her back, and she was repeatedly assaulted as she tried to make her way to a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused headaches and then lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after he passed out and claim they would have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
But they found time to change Deng’s clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the brotherhood’s national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, members began hiding personal belongings and practically put the good of the brotherhood before the good of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated by the rituals of the brotherhoods, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life each year because of the rituals,” Douglas Fierberg, the lawyer for Deng’s family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable and this action taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe District Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with a third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be indicted for contempt and complicity in murder.
“We want to hold accountable not only the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable,” Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve raises the interest rate.
The interest rate will rise and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will happen and how long it will take.
In economics, history offers few clues about time frames.
After the first rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how it responds to the economy and financial assets.
That is why US central bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when the interest rate starts to rise but on the trajectory of the time needed for normalization.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in play.
But ultimately, market players might find that all the turmoil related to the interest rate hike has been exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first rate hike after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the era of ‘cheap money,’” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
However, it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Below we present how some sectors of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation that the market has faced in recent months, anticipating an increase in the interest rate may volatilize things for a while.
However, at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There appears to be a trend for capital returns to stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the monetary policy lag,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed’s increases.
Specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has grown sharply - by about 14 percent - heading towards the increase in interest rate, quite unchanged in the period of 250 days after (average rise of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by Nuve Management by Stratef.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate hike cycle and profits are starting to fall.
Recession is a reality of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
Specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historic low for an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 the figure was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question “if this time is different,” Deutsche said.
Players in the market have been preparing for a year-round increase decision by the Fed, with all eyes set on this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an interest rate increase at the meeting, forward trades indicate a likelihood of only 25%.
“In our study since 1950, all interest rate growth cycles to date have been in a super profit growth cycle, with GDP overshadowing pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery began,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery after the worst recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster on bonds than on stocks when the Fed changes the policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the yield on bonds drops immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that these interest rate hikes will bring profitability closer between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds perform better in such an environment, although “we are still cautious about forcing profitability,” Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and declining inflation estimates, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy,” Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is more straightforward, the spread of the average credit interest rate has widened and volatility has increased – all market characteristics as the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies operating mostly in the U.S. will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the rise of the dollar will lead to the price of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital receipts and low volatility stocks also outperformed similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the dollar’s growth.
Those who save might also have gained, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for being "foolish"
He says he is increasingly similar to his commercial opponent.
He also took to the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized the Brits awards.
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, stating that this show is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning into" Classic FM, a senior MP said, pressuring the station to prove it is doing something commercial stations are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC heads that the public radio station was "foolish" and increasingly resembling its commercial adversary.
“I feel like Radio 3 is ‘foolish’ – although I don’t like to use the word – but I feel like it’s turning into Classic FM,” he said.
It also won the BBC Music Awards, which were launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that just copy what's already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC director general denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial opponent in live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anything about the classical music I hear from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production is unrivalled.
“In addition, I think it’s also important to Radio 3’s commitment to discovering new music and allocating new tracks,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to do more to attract audiences compared to the previous period because British people have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only item under the BBC logo criticized at the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sports Committee for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative lawmaker Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for around <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be done "in a BBC-specific manner."
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find the golden egg hen in its own shed” the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future takeover of new seasons of The Voice or spend the money that goes into licensing on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded the lowest growth in August and could be blamed on Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month has seen its slowest growth since 2000.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to shop.
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday could lead to reluctance to spend.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned Britain’s shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August showed the lowest increase since 2000, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to streamline over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, to The Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when shoppers started using their mobile phones to shop.
This increased the number of people who could shop online and could do so under various circumstances, such as on the sofa.
But now that it has stagnated a little, you may notice a decrease (increase).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers crowded in front of computers to get their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of the websites of several retailers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers have fought over bargains, could lead to buyers’ reluctance.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every <0xC2><0xA3>5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion stores in shopping areas.
After Bin Laden family sanction, Muslims bury victims killed in Mecca crane crash
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were strolled through the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured in the crash of the crane.
In the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a crane crashed at the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Clothed in white, those who mourned their dead joined the road to express their condolences, until the first dead arrived at the end of the final journey, at Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the faithful.
The bodies were released for funerals after the Saudi king sanctioned the Bin Laden family’s construction group for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a crane crashed at the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have let the crane arm up when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi news agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not give the details, but said the company’s leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane’s collapse in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
Binladin Group has not yet made any statements about the crane crash and Group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and not coordinating its work with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is running major construction projects.
The last al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a “renegade” son, disinherited from the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in strong winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Authorities decided that the relatives of the deceased would receive one million Saudi rials (174,000 pounds) and the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Others will receive half of that amount.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Converting Credits to Swiss Francs
On the banking market, there have already been two offers to convert loans in Swiss francs into lei, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest rates can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process on the conversion of loans in francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost announced the conversion offer for its own clients.
According to data compiled by analysts of the FinZoom financial portal, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest at 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the conversion offer of Banca Transilvania was accepted by 83% of clients with loans in francs due to two successive reductions: the balance was reduced with the value of the risk and administration fees paid by the client, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to the equivalent monthly plateau in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Advantages
The main advantage of the RON credits in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from future increases of the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which he collects his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no revaluation of the property, no additional guarantees and no further proof of income.
Basically, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit, nor will there be any additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer discount to the monthly rate, compared to the plateau customers before the conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first few years is made up more of interest, and the customer pays very little back on the principal.
The Bancpost offer with very low interest rates in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
It is not known how this will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be more than 3.25%, so in total, and the cost reduction is less.
A possible risk for all variable-interest RON loans is that the ROBOR index will rise significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor index - CHF).
For example, three-month ROBOR is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to incur other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for interest rate decisions for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is looking forward to the meeting scheduled in two days’ time, Wednesday and Thursday, when the Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half who last week believed the decision would be made, now believe the situation will hold for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop the zero rate and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the less pink global situation.
He has warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
People who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia and in 2009 he lost his lifelong partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly has a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw has been on the bench for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right foot in Manchester United's Champions League match, which ended in a loss to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player’s eyes and will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The crash came after a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after Shaw, 20, broke the PSV defense.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture in his leg and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then he'll be operated on in Manchester.
It’s awful – a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he’s having difficulties, then he’s playing fantastic and now it’s happening.
In the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I am not a doctor, but at double fracture the rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped the red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it's foul and red card.
It was a very bad intervention, with two legs.
A tweet from Shaw's Twitter account said: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I'm starting the road to recovery, I'll come back stronger."
Manchester United hit by injury to Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
The England defender has one more reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very bad injury.”
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to crash an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexico national team against the Dutch national team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the phase.
I could only see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it but I couldn’t see the intervention on Luke.
In the statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it’s like, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel so bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England’s omission but still holds hard
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but, after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not consider a repetition of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
I would not eliminate the possibility of a victory on the move.
Maybe Alastair Cook’s team has less experience than three years ago but they have good players on the spin in the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Adam Lyth left England for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to consider the decision not to select Adam Lyth for the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good strikers in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged by the results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because – and I said that before – the players are their own pickers.
About fifty years and Lyth may have extended his run, but his fate lies in his hands.
I hope that if he does more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when the performance was not up to his capacity and I am not surprised by this; first and foremost, he is a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long a batsman is noticed in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs — like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky at home and on the move.
The only displeasure you may have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean Tour - when Lyth was in top form - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
In the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman who I rate very well.
He’s a cricketer who has the “X factor” and we noticed early at Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open the fight with Cook, which would lead to extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already shown he's fucked up.
Moeen may not have brought success to his district, Worcestershire, but he was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches as a first drop before entering the open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari joins the team as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People might judge his young age — with an average of 31 to the beat and 35 to the ball — and might think he’s stitched, but there aren’t a lot of spinners and the coaches opted for youth.
You will learn a lot from this tour.
England also made some changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a test match consultant could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the tournament’s white-ball leg and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they convey messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham’s teammate Ben Stokes is resting for the one-day matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not all agree, coaches and coaches do not make the schedule.
And you have to remember, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy.
The Brexit camp could win if the economy remains calm until 2017
With each passing day, David Cameron’s renegotiating strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting more and more into trouble, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy “Yes or no?” Corbyn at the helm of the Labour Party or TUC brings on Tuesday serious criticism of Europe.
Aliens have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained last week that - plunged into crises similar to that in the EU - not all being caused internally - some member states are fed into Britain's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they would not want this if they eroded social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George’s “selfie” agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor participate in summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain with an outward perspective under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says - suggests that several dumb ministers and officials in certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation falters, as happened with Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14 years old) and Kohl (16 years old), who have stayed too long.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain one on the left.
It’s hard to believe that these will help the British posing, whose energy would be best used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers may even plan to intentionally make remarks that do not help, in the style of the SNP, in the campaign for the 2017 UK referendum to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was fixed" and "the United Kingdom gained nothing of value from the renegotiation".
Europeans know on their own skins how captivating Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the barons in the oligarchic press are who look at the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our entry in 1973 in the 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was corresponding to Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of tax-free crooks, foreigners who defrauded by phone and pseudo-non-domes who own most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them pretty much the same, but he realized that when you’re locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you for lunch and again for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron’s referendum idea, given that Blair made a principled concession to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who friendly touched me on my back Monday at Westminster — I told him not to waste his time with me — seems in danger of adopting from the egg the Murdoch strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take a while, but she needs to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose position on the BBC left her on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official stance towards Europe is what I would indulgently call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
The majority of those who disagree with the “anglicism” of the Conservatives might agree with that.
That's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and TV this week, when the scout in him struggled not to acknowledge that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as "shadow" finance minister was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to fellow Labourers, without going too far and without losing his office in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “in any situation” — Benn’s expression — does not match what McDonnell said or what JC said to colleagues and lawmakers at Monday night’s private meeting.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he also sensitized me - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of television and especially in the vortex of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is fair not to give Cameron a favour ticket in Europe, allowing him to take Labour’s support in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic sophism about EU membership – consistent with their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his sophistication about NATO - Tom Watson is unwavering about the fact that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – and there are suspicious voters – on concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed with the British’s poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticize the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, a government agency’s claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with ties to the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “reference” report last month and described it as a “complex analysis of the evidence.”
Several researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the “extraordinarily fragile base” on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned the claims and their basis “on solid ground or moving sand.”
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said they expect the PHE claims that “current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting involving 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) that summarizes their views on the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, it said.
They added that one of the 12 attendees at the meeting said he received funding from an e-cigarette maker but not the funding that is reported to have received from cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but among them there are a few "frontiers" known in the production of e-cigarettes, some of them even declare in the paper the financing of the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the Tobacco Control Section of the PHE.
The group’s research work “convincingly conceals” the fact that there is “strong evidence of the harmful effect that most products have on most of the criteria,” McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said the PHE claims that “so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, the head of the health department at PHE, says he has responded to the BMJ’s claims in the past.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have smoked all their lives lose their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk of e-cigarettes to health is comparatively minor, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about information that emerges and information that does not emerge from evidence, in particular given the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives due to an illness associated with smoking and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Clearly expressing the current evidence - that while the use of e-cigarettes is not risk-free, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
Advertisements that embarrass Britain’s arms trade
Watch Amnesty International’s film against the arms trade.
Terrible killer drones!
Beasts for crushing ankles!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric sticks that cause creepy pain without leaving traces!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world’s largest arms fair is a bitter charade, carried out by Amnesty International to underline the desire of the British authorities to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.
DSEI Arms Fair: Authoritarian Regimes Arrive in London
But a separate campaign has also led to a large number of posters being displayed at bus stops and in subways that need a second look.
“Important announcement, are you traveling with the DLR between September 15 and 18?” says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London Underground, with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will crash into DLR Customers are being asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited their work at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London using the Ad Space Hack Packs, a six-pound package of Allen keys that it says “facilitates access to about one-third of the advertising space at bus stations on the planet.”
The London Transportation Authority is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of flyers.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Cruel Designs curator and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists turn to collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they need to come out into the real world for their art to impact society.
Another poster against the arms trade that welcomes commuters traveling by subway.
The film made by Amnesty had more than 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist who dubbed the voice also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the ad for the arms fair – with an empty space in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with making a more realistic advertisement but "enriching it with animations and strong colors, it was more striking".
“They did a great job helping us increase interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair,” says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not traded illegally and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the subject of the arms fair comes from inside the ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order it received from the U.S. military regarding “AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher.”
This includes “a uniquely shaped warhead that delivers stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in the Home
It’s been 11 years since I moved into the home, when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but I only now remember the forced smiles of those I annoyed — and the many complaints about others.
Most of the things we’ve learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states ranging from nervous breakdown to horror.
Speech is tempting: to tell people where you come from, if and where you’ve spent a year off from school, what you think of Corbyn, and why “honestly, you don’t care about Marmite because, for real guys, it’s nothing but yeast extract HAHAHA, you can find me in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe - ask questions and show interest.
These animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from the ones you wouldn’t talk to even if the flood came and they would be the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Bedrooms often abound with drink parties, movie nights and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress up and try on their underwear.

Violinist David Grimal: In Bach’s time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
The French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less ordinary project, quite "strange", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who play a symphonic repertoire in the classical and without having a saxophone.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one on Monday, when the cellist Xavier Phillips was in the foreground, the works composed by Enescu being indispensible.
Both shows, held on the Athenaeum stage, showed the audience another way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 and was, at the time, the only classical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - I am talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as "specialized workers".
They themselves feel they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all the musical fetishism is focused on the conductor.
And so the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
We are no longer talking about music.
So if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and an audience that can’t listen, but has to watch, which is stupid again.”
The violinist recounts that this change in the way he makes music came after the "musical disappointments" of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was in my 30s, I found this very depressing, because I could no longer find human creativity and fraternity in this system.
So I have found no point in continuing on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did this without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
“How do I imagine you doing marketing with a collective of musicians in which there is no ego anymore?” the artist asks.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", noting that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance in the musical act: "Curiously, the more we sing a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all the musicians are forced to be present in the opera and not only in the role", argues Grimal, adding that on Sunday's stage "heram 74".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is "very brave", precisely because he also invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the largest orchestras in the world are present that sing and 3 times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you have invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and an interest in something different that breaks down barriers.
Speaking of Enescu’s work, the violinist admits that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu’s works in his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal advocates a change in the way classical music education is done, considering that "the profession of a musician, as it is organized today, has an iz of death" and that "the future of music represents music itself".
We don't need to go around the world five times a year if it doesn't help.
In Bach’s time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tours, the release of albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example of Romanian products before and after accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before you entered the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU you had to pass health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture are at the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
Music is the same, it’s the same logic.
Les Dissonances make tomatoes maybe not too beautiful, but when we cut them they are real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but it needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
“If we were to consider – as do Koreans, Chinese, Japanese – that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning in school, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products,” Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we train a musician who will play an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier, it has to be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it is quite another.
What do you think is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?” the French artist asked, smiling.
Grimal points out that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this status of "soldier", overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain moment that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert they come out smiling".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Institute Romania.
Profile David Grimal
After following the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique in Paris under the guidance of Regis Pasquier, during which he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed the course of his life.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, along which he has regularly given concerts in the last 20 years on the main classical music scenes of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as Orchestre de Paris, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, Russian National Orchestra, Orchestre National de Lyon, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Berliner Symphony Orchestra.

In addition to his career as a solo artist, David Grimal wanted to explore more personal projects.
The freedom offered by his collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Alongside Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts given for the benefit and together with the homeless at the church of Saint-Leu, located in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been a Resident Artist at the Opera in Dijon.
He teaches violin at the Musikhochschule in Saarbrücken, Germany.
He also holds many master classes and was a member of the jury of the International Long-Thibaud Competition in Paris in 2010.
He was awarded the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal plays on a Stradivarius, "former Roederer" from 1710, but also on "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by the French luthier Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present on Sunday at this year’s George Enescu International Festival together with the Les Dissonances Orchestra, in the program being Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also took to the stage on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: dubbing two characters from the superproduction "Snow Queen 3D"
Do you have a super talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give him a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic drawings the emphasis was placed on bringing the voice of the actor closer to the specifics of the animated character, in recent times, the creation of the story also takes into account those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are starting an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to register their children for our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
“The children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors,” said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between September 11 and September 30, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection following which will be chosen 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a sample in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents need to do is access the smalllevocimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where they can register the child for the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Subsequently, he must choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then the child will record himself playing his own version of dubbing.
Four movies about friendship, fairytale heroes, magic and hope can choose the contestants to support the challenge: "Yellow Pens 3D", "Mune: The Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: The Koala 3D" and "Maya Bee 3D".
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double a character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx earnings are mixed, fiscal forecasts lower for 2016
FedEx said disappointing results for the last quarter, as the delivery giant lowered its year-round profit estimates as a result of low demand for transportation services and increased costs for its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s shares fell about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the opening bell sounded on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts expected the figure to be $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The decreasing estimate comes despite an average price increase of 4.9%, with the entry into force on January 4 and higher surcharges for land transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to grow year-on-year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said: “The firm is facing a considerably weaker-than-expected economic situation, particularly in terms of global production and trade.”
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after the UPS competitor said it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number it did last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research survey.
Profit increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who took part in the Zacks survey estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipping, which has led to stagnation in revenues from its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping jumped the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the ground division’s revenues increased by 29%, but operating revenues stagnant due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit saw revenue growth due to higher base rates, while revenue from the freight division declined due to rising costs.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
Tuesday at closing had fallen by 11% year-on-year and by 17% from the record high recorded on June 11.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meeting in recent years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide if the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank meeting room, will be seen a mural of the United States.
The map is meant to remind Janet L. Yellen, Fed President, and her colleagues to put the nation’s economic interests above all else.
The Central Bank has been given a dual task by Congress: to maximize the U.S. employment rate and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in an overly difficult decision to anticipate, to be announced on Tuesday, that will determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to be rid of the unprecedented stimulus offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in effect since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data points to a strong growing economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed officials off adding volatility by raising the benchmark rate to federal funds — even by just a quarter percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will pursue,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the growing uncertainty in the global market is enough to give them arguments to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on the Fed’s decision, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg anticipated an increase in interest rates this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay, with a key indicator showing the likelihood of growth at only 30 percent.
This would indicate a fall on the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policymakers ease the blow by promising it would take a long time for the next rise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The upturn was triggered by expectations that the Fed's policymakers would keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising for the Fed to raise the interest rate at this time,” Lonski said.
If the Fed were to do so, “they would have to act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets.”
Other experts said an interest rate hike would calm financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be on track to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step toward slowing monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase in interest rates this year despite objections by liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers total employment.
Earnings showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fall short of the central bank’s annual target, Fed policymakers said a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply falling oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them given the strain on the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began fibrillation at the end of this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below the record high reached in May as investors feared the slowdown in China's economy would pull down global growth.
The market has receded somewhat this month, with the Dow index now about 10% below its May high.
For Fed policymakers, market turmoil adds to the complex calculation of the moment when the interest rate rises.
“Without what has happened in the financial markets and the news of China’s weakening economy in recent weeks, they would be firmer at the hearing,” said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now, he predicts that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy and they almost have no data to rely on after the events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s major interests, so it should practically not be taken into account when making decisions.
But in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank’s influence has been enormous.
The mere suggestion by then-president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “narrow” its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly twinned, Fed officials are expected to not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at welfare management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that “the Fed has an oversized track record of reacting to changes in the financial market that seem unrelated to the economic underpinnings.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported interest rate increases, gave the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that hit Asia prompted the Fed to cut the benchmark rate by 0.75 percent in three meetings, “despite implications with limited identification for U.S. development,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reverted to those declines.
The Fed should only put the issue of financial stability first in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
The last turbulent period does not even rise to that level, he said.
“We certainly don’t want to get into the situation of fearing an increase in interest rates because the markets are upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this regard, I do not think it should take premature action.
Are you looking for a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C from Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/depot opened/opened in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The Market/Warehouse is a universal store offering an astonishing range of fresh, frozen and dehydrated products, popular Thai and Asian snacks and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is also a garage where you need to buy some engine oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to go through all the corridors.
If you’re hungry for so much, eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The inner food area of the store (good, affordable) is close to the houses and offers several options of dishes that can be taken as a package.
What does it have in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it at LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some items are sold wholesale.
Fresh products include herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat rack is large, so is the fish rack - the staff serving will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it for you if you want.
An important part of the shop is dedicated to the huge freezer rayon, where you will find curry leaves, frozen watermelon and ginger, whole ducks, fish, blood and beef ball, pork carcasses, fish meatballs, traditional sausages, semi-prepared and much more.
Who buys from there: Restaurant owners and chefs, also families and individuals.
On the wide corridors fit both shopping trolleys and forklifts.
Discovery: fresh Durian fruit right next to the area of the houses.
The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own shared parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although there are chances that the store will crowd, it is usually not hard to find parking space.
Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite attempts by Channel Nine to air on the Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to report on the consequences of the changes in the Liberal party's leadership did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of Channel Nine aired from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing show Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over several weeks, which included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "crudeness" of distance did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday’s (317,000) and last Tuesday’s (283,000) audiences but figures were lower than last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
For now, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened all morning.
This morning, not only Parliament is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the question!

The main news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children off the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson could handle a show alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Audience results for last night resounded as "yes."
Seven's X Factor remained in place with 1,136 million viewers, taking the lead from The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night of broadcasting The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new, moderated general culture show had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30-6:00 p.m.) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 and the second half had a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia’s second-night ratings will give Nine tacit confidence that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, which failed to defeat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of gunfire at an airport in Siberia.
Because he openly provoked President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts diminished.
Four people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and Molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police used tear gas and fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest after weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also occurred in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes on 10 August.
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a country centrally governed for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fences, dogs, cops and weapons
The Prime Minister continues to exchange remarks with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of Wednesday’s government meeting, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm position on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or policemen with weapons.
"It is a disgrace for Europe in the 21st century to apply methods from the 1930s," Ponta said.
"The prime minister also said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and set out in the CSAT meeting on Thursday," the prime minister concluded.
NHC Announces 60% Probability of Cyclone South of Cape Verde Islands
A broad low-pressure front about 560 km south of Cape Verde’s southernmost point has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight-reduction surgery may be helpful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight-loss surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could hold for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those following non-surgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of weight relative to height, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by going to: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy — in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI in people who underwent surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatments for diabetes remained at almost the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely cured at 36 percent and partially cured at 28 percent.
In the medically treated group, by comparison, diabetes completely cured in only 1% and partially in only 2% of the subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimum level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c level decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, it was maintained at about 8%.
But this improved “glycemic control”—reflected by improved levels of hemoglobin A1c—did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), experienced more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c 16 % (3.1% versus 2.1%) and had a higher likelihood of remission (diabetes 46 % versus 5.1).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavyweight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona, Phoenix School of Medicine.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had an approximately 29% lower chance of dying after 15 years, compared with a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
“This is the point where this paper is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the group with lower BMI,” without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking their weight seriously then the patient’s BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to urge people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have short-circuited their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not welcome all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call for an end to violence in the mother countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, while admirably, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“The care for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but at the same time we need to think of long-term solutions to bring sincere peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Regarding the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying the U.S. violent response generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of 9/11, I conveyed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to resolve this issue without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, U.S. anti-poison centers reported an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed high-alcohol hand detergent.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, cases of hand detergent ingestion in children under the age of 12 reported at anti-poison centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children intentionally drink detergent and others do so to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social media.
You can watch movies on YouTube that show teenagers drinking detergent to create cheap drinks.
It turns out that teenagers mixed the detergent with mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of detergent.
“A child doesn’t think it’s hurting them,” Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are the fragrant ones.
Hand detergents with the flavor of strawberry, grape, orange are the most attractive for children.
Hand detergent contains about 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, just a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Kansas University Hospital’s poison control center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones reach them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four strawberry-flavored hand detergent sprays at school, arrived at the emergency room for treatment.
She had high blood alcohol levels, twice the threshold at which an adult is legally considered under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was mumbling and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children’s hospital to identify signs of brain damage as the girl fell and hit her head from alcohol, Ritchey said.
“It was scary,” Nhaijah’s mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or damp wipes and to keep the hand detergent out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand detergent that contained an undeclared toxic ingredient.
Health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in northern New York plotted to poison their “bad” teacher by “putting antibacterial products in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned it in her classroom.
Police said the plan was “insignificant” and referred the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.

The absence of Scots in the title race bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because they are not fighting for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, Ajax's current ambassador, said: "In the Netherlands, I don't send the summary of matches to Celtic anymore; why?"
Because there's no Rangers in there.
It’s not just the return of the Rangers.
We are talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s where the interest is directed.
The tension is high in the Old Firm matches and it’s not just the Scots who want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, Deila promises.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic were fighting hard but the Norwegian boss promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination in the Champions League were followed by the defeat against Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now in the top of the standings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had periods before and will recover."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what’s going on.
We feel the same way, but we need to move forward.
We need the support of Celtic because this way the players become better.
It is very important that we remain united now.
Warburton's prudence regarding January transfers
Despite comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he had identified some targets for the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he doesn’t want to hurt the Ibrox unit.
The former Brentford chief said: “The transfer period in January is very different from the summer one.”
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is the pre-season period in which they can be integrated, which you could observe this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do worse if you bring in unneeded players.
Celtic targets Michu after retirement
Swansea Striker Michu, who was associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested he could retire on the expiry of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old has struggled for two years with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts clashes with SFA over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3-2, but the quarterback's red card was then voided - the third red card voided in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken to heart after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014 at a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
"It was a derby and it was the excitement of the moment," the striker said, adding: "There's no need to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts Dundee United - Donnelly management
Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United’s board is still confident that the management team will change the situation – but agrees that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We’ll get the boys back in shape,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for ‘dirty victory’ over Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team has to cling desperately to Hamilton Accies for their seventh consecutive league win, which brought them five points to Celtic due to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or the league, and has not won matches like this."
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK rises
Scotland’s unemployment rate remains unchanged at 164,000 in May-July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK has risen by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The 5.9% unemployment rate in Scotland was higher than in the UK, at 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% – a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The authorities’ long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with the employment rate growing and the unemployment rate falling.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a delayed legal intervention, I will watch as a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll sit in an observer room in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, the idea frightens me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can witness executions in America, and because applications usually exceed the number of seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
Those elected will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, plus I developed my own connection with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to have a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he wishes, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he “could have formulated it better,” but he still feels that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t even do it if you asked me.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants to have an international report on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files we made.
I won't come back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I do not think there is enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll learn what it's like to watch a man I like die uselessly.
Peter Moody claims the stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to pull out of the race
Peter Moody said the Victoria Racing stewards either tried to infiltrate a spy into his stables last year and threatened to immediately withdraw from racing.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the removal of Lady Tatai from the race due to treatment given on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the racing field and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidari’s positive cobalt test result, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about the statements about spies and did not want to resemble the "fox that does not reach the grapes".
“I wasn’t going to say anything about that and I was silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all comes crashing down all of a sudden,” Moody said.
It is known that it continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I will go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that I am striving to give them the best.
From the moment they start to think that this is not the case, I have to give up my job as a trainer.
At that point I will have to think about what I will do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department tried to spy on his stables.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man — whose name I’ll tell you if I’m asked — and they offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there,” Moody told Racing.com.
He obviously considers me a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a backbone and can hold people outside of the trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry so bad?
Maybe that's how others see it.
Maybe they need to take my license and put me aside and I have no doubt that the statements I make now might cause them to think about this variant.
But I’ve reached the point where I don’t care anymore and that saddens me.
It makes me very sad.
I will put pressure on them and cause them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can go.
The trainer’s frustration grew with the lengthy investigation into cobalt testing in which Lidari was involved and the removal prompted him to say he could “put his license on the table.”
Moody, whose name is most often associated with coaching undefeated champion Black Caviar, has labeled the day-of-race treatment rule "ridiculous" after applying a mud or clay poultice to horses' feet, breaking the rules.
They break the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his foot.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which is what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the day-of-race treatment of the poultice, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the crash site in Cobram has been arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker that occurred in Cobram at the end of the week and was followed by a run away from the crash site.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he was seriously injured after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley Highway.
Police say the driver did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to Shepparton police.
Apparently, he will be charged with running away from the crash site, failing to provide first aid and other road crimes.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to opponents in wrestling allegations.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of his team's plating tactics "distorted topics" brought up by the top two NRL favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees had allowed Storm players to "smash" the team in Storm's nervous win in Friday night's qualifying final in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in Saturday night's North Queensland Cowboys qualifying game when he called the match a rugby league "demonstration" and said the two Queensland teams were not very good at w.
Bellamy jumped in defense of the plating tactics approached by his team and said the players were simply focusing on "contact" when plating.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two top coaches criticized his team, meaning they were worried Storm would beat them.
“And things don’t stop here — I didn’t hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything all year in our defensive systems or techniques, only that over the last six weeks we have really focused on touch in tackles and so we have changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so he’s probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
Funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Bennett's Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his point by comparing his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and talked about how exciting the game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George got a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he didn’t care as much about black under his nail.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider to be exciting football, especially because of the fast young midfielders.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat worried about the match with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they were thinking about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and the Roosters was a tougher scoring match than the match between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven’t seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, does that mean exciting game?
Or exciting is taking breaks and not scoring?
There are plans for me.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we might meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in Saturday's preliminary final at AAMI Park, with tickets on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used girls’ phones to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images with copies as the subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the missing phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he slept.
He looked at the phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
Upon arrival, police saw the five photos then analyzed computers found at the address and found “worrying” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "attractive pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretending to be a cop to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: "He said it's an addiction - that he's addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to pose as a policeman to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations he had with the stranger who had sent him the images and the fact that he had asked the person to send him other pictures.
He said he did it to lure.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and that he wants to see images of rapes and murders.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the little girl found the messages on her phone, she yelled at her mother and she was shaking and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of taking or taking indecent photos of child subjects, and violated the conditions of his conditional release on January 25 this year and did not appear before the court on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim has requested that Hogg not be registered in the sex offender registry because it can be said that this crime “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October on grounds of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody before appearances for other cases.
It was entered into the sex offender register before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
He wasn’t hurt, but the video went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who claimed that they had received anonymous death threats, threatening them not to hound Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they hounded him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it's titled 'death,'" he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns concerned parliamentarians that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity no longer holds any value.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "worried" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to make 30,000 redundancies
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company’s restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the service sector.
This year, HP will be split into two companies, separating the computer and printer division from its rapidly growing corporate hardware and service operations.
The planned releases will bring costs of about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure,” said Meg Whitman, HP president and CEO, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will have a broad portfolio of businesses that will help businesses transition to the new style of business,” Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and will “focus on providing unrivaled integrated solutions” to companies.
A company was founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, whose business was the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the "Silicon Valley cradle".
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to adapt to the shift from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest computer maker and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the field, building on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men peaking at the peak of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to challenge the culture that keeps men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to succeed in this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood,” his chances of recovery are doubled.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of social media-dominated communication, where the emphasis is on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality it is isolation that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values – our inner desire for personal development and friendship – that further profoundly affect our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn’t really buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused attention on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humour of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, the moments they stare at football in their comfy armchairs, and Ross’s passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even if they often shy away from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: “My role in listening to people who are suicidal and depressed has shown how even the slightest interactions with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who come to us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying that you can handle yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer multiple long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
The show highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
As much as objective, external intervention through the phone helps, people reached in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you’re attending this weekend’s FriendsFest hosted by Comedy Central, with full playback of the sets to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG put Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored in his debut match in the Champions League on Tuesday and helped PSG win against Sweden's Malmo.
Below we present the game chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their homework, Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League group series with a reassuring 2-0 victory against Malmo in Tuesday’s match at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before securing their lead with the goal scored by Cavani in the 61st minute.
Coming to Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shahtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the optimums but also an improvement in the path to the quarter-finals in each of the last three tournaments.
But while they took the points, Laurent Blanc's pupils were far from perfect, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic squandering the opportunity of goal after which he was replaced by the team in his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so winning 2-0 creates problems for our opponents and makes a comfortable difference to the next qualifiers, even if there are still things that we need to improve throughout the season,” Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I’m sorry we didn’t manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic came back from injury at one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw from Bordeaux at home in Ligue 1 over the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he sprang at Marco Verratti’s pass behind Malmo’s defense before slamming unbelievably over Johan Wiland in the long corner to the right of the goal.
But if anyone expected PSG to win by snapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine starters to national teams, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, with the exception of Nikola Djurdjic's kick that overtook Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed the pace several times, giving some unnecessary passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts in the first half only and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game resumed.
However, Ibrahimovic proved much more skilled in supporting his colleagues, his pass being the one that Di Maria sent in a kick deflected by Wiland over the goal in the 52nd minute.
Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed through Maxwell, scored in the final after an hour of the match.
This goal eliminated Malmo’s hopes of rebalancing the score and only a superb stop from Wiland’s distance for David Luiz’s rejection maintained the final score before new entrant Ezequiel Lavezzi was overturned in extra time.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later said that PSG had been a class over and that "the last match I played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Take your hat off for PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore Raises $2.5 Billion in Share Sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodity exchange, raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a broad plan to massively reduce debt.
The London-listed Glencore company said it had sold <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off the debt.
After losing 57 percent of its market value this year, the company is battling falling commodity prices because China’s slump in economic activity is influencing demand and wreaking havoc on markets.
The preferential right to subscribe raised the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning trades.
Shares rose 2.77% to 131.60 shillings at the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a 0.69% higher value.
Glencore unveiled the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of broader plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 shillings per share, down 2.4 percent from Tuesday’s closing price.
It removed 1.3 billion shares from the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concerns about the growth of China’s prolonged stagnating economy led to substantial rises in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20-40%.
Xi urges broader expansion of world economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy needs to open up more to the outside world to fuel growth.
“China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving openness policies,” Xi said at the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and give way to economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganizing the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify the sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a business environment based on legislation and providing a wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls over the powers they delegate to companies, making sure these companies decide how to run their businesses.
According to the statement, China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
“State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign investment companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called “green cards”, optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right of practice of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Trade unions in education, dissatisfied with the Government's proposal to increase wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the Education unions did not reach any result, the Government proposing a 10% wage increase, from December 1, with payment on January 1, 2016, and the unions wanted an increase of 15%, from November, or one of 20%, from December.
The talks took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the prime minister accompanied by Education Minister Sorin Cimpeanu, Finance Minister Eugen Teodorovici and Labour Minister Rovana Plumb.
The proposal of the Government today did not please us, otherwise we would not have been in a position to convene the leaderships of our federations.
The 10 percent we are promised today is less than we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money that we stipulated in our agreement with the government last year for 2016," said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI in which the representatives of the Government will also participate in order to present to the representatives of the confederations of the country the proposal of wage increase, followed by the unionists deciding whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The prime minister also told trade unionists that the government is trying to send the pay bill to parliament as soon as possible so that it can enter into force on December 1.
In the normative act it is foreseen to increase the salaries of the educational system with 25% of the total increase of 70%, an increase foreseen in the document to be made exaggerated, in the next four years.
Also, Victor Ponta has promised trade unionists the acquittal of all the judgments in 2016.
Migrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkish waters on Tuesday after their boat sank.
Among the victims were 11 women and five children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and was heading for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey’s coast guard said it had managed to rescue 249 people on the wrecked boat, but their nationality was not yet known.
Earlier Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Over the weekend, 34 migrants, including four babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The route has become a popular one lately for immigrants who want to escape war and hard life from countries like Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 female stewardesses fired for being too fat
Air India lays off about 130 stewardesses for being overweight, the airline said at the end of last week.
The state-run company said the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the move is “ridiculous” and “shockingly sexist.”
The mass layoff is the latest in a ten-year struggle between the company and the busier stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began using charts with ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired the nine stewardesses considered "exceptionally overweight" because this "may have an effect on reflexes and may impede the agility necessary to carry out emergency measures".
The stewardesses sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
“All efforts to make them lose weight have failed,” a company spokesperson said.
“I am not going to be able to do that, but I am going to be able to do that.
A footballer from Steaua gives lessons to Gigi Becali regarding the promotion of young players.
If the champion's funder decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable sum, Paul Papp opened a football school.
"Paul Papp" Academy will operate in the city of Dej, deserts in the town are expected to a first selection action.
I am extremely happy that I have reached this stage, to start the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented kids who can play football without worrying about training materials.
There is only one thing you need to do: play football as well as you can.
The technical details don’t have to be their concern.
They have to value their talents.
This is what the Football Academy wants to do 'Paul Papp'.
"I am also waiting for the mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children, to show them that he is with them," Papp told breakfast.ro.
At the Academy of the Star quarterback are expected children up to 11 years of age.
The whole party wants to govern.
Interim PSD President Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and, if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalize this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta awaits this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If we want to formalize it by a decision of Congress, we will do the same.
There won't be any excitement about it.
"There have been no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that give someone uncertainty of the government or that give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the meeting of the PSD National Permanent Bureau.
PSD has announced when it will hold congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that at the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, a clear message be given if the government is to continue or if the party decides to move to the opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce on Monday if I will run for a position in Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he will run for a leadership position at the next Congress.
I will weigh, Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is also fixed.
"I will announce if I will run for a position in the leadership of the party," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD's National Permanent Bureau.
Asked if the hesitation about the announcement of the candidacy has to do with his file, Dragnea said that he does not have this problem.
I do not have the problem you are referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce or not a candidacy when the date of Congress is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of the Social Democratic branches proposed a PSD Extraordinary Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party’s Executive Committee.

Italian man caught at Bors customs with migrants hiding in TIR
Two Sri Lankans were spotted Monday at the Bors customs office as they tried to cross the border illegally, hiding in a semi-trailer of a truck driven by an Italian citizen.
According to the investigation, the two had paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, according to the Border Police.
At the specific control, border guards noticed, in the cabin of the truck, a large travel bag, in which there were personal things for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough control on the means of transport.
On this occasion, border guards discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the car, among the plastic crates, two male people.
According to the verifications, two men, aged 28, are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
“In the investigations, the young people stated that they intended to arrive in France, which is why they contacted a countryman, through whom they met the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they were to receive 2,000 euros per person,” the statement said.
The two migrants were given “criminal work in relation to committing the crime of attempted fraudulent crossing of the state border”.
Pompeo B., the 45-year-old Italian citizen who was driving a Renault Magnum car registered in Romania, carrying plastic crates for a company in Italy, was detained for 24 hours, before being presented to the Bihor Court with a proposal for pre-trial arrest.
How Satisfied Are Romans in a Couple: Men versus Women
Most Americans are happy with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study carried out on the occasion of the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents said they were “very satisfied” and “satisfied” with the overall quality of the relationship.
"However, 18% show themselves to be 'slightly unsatisfied' and 'very unsatisfied' in the relationship, and another 18% declare themselves 'right'," the study said in a statement.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analyzed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% suitable, 6% very unsatisfied and 8% slightly unsatisfied.
In terms of women, 33% said they were satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
As for the neutral state (accordingly), we see a difference of two percent.
“The same goes for the very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference being the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 percent,” the statement said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or even less time together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% spend between two and four hours.
“Romans need a little more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), security (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect (18%), trust 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-knowledge 10%.”
The study was done by Extreme Training between June 1st and September 1st on 1,369 people, with a calculated margin of error of 2.6%.
Europe was once again embarrassed.
German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe had "been embarrassed" after the failure of Monday's ministerial meeting in Brussels on the allocation of refugees within the European Union.
"Last night, Europe was once again embarrassed," Sigmar Gabriel, who is also economy minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, told a news conference.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested cutting EU structural funds for countries that reject refugee quotas.
European interior ministers, meeting Monday in Brussels, have failed to reach an agreement on the mandatory allocation of 120,000 refugees, called for by the European Commission last week to deal with one of the worst migrant crises in Europe since 1945.
He was mayor for half an hour.
The interim mayor of Tuzla municipality in Constanta county enjoyed only half an hour of this function, due to DNA prosecutors.
Taner Resit had been appointed to the leadership of the locality, instead of the former mayor, Constantin Micu, convicted of embezzlement, informs B1 Tv.
The prefect of the county, Ion Constantin, waited for him at the headquarters of the institution to make the official announcement, at 16:00, but he did not arrive.
The reason?
Taner Resit was summoned at 14:00, at the headquarters of DNA Constanta.
After two and a half hours of hearings, he was detained for 24 hours.
He was mayor for only 30 minutes.
According to the prosecutors, he is accused of blackmailing a businessman between August 16 and September 8, in complicity with Stefan Radu, an employer who wanted to obtain 48,000 euros from him.
The two threatened the manager, drove out their customers, prevented them from entering his store, changed the locks and seized the company’s assets.
Moreover, on September 8, Stefan Radu would have beaten the administrator, in the presence of the deputy mayor.
Thousands of people came to put a candle on it.
Thousands of people passed by the coffin with the body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people no longer being at St. George's Church than at the refining of his home at the Great Feast of St. Nicholas, parish priest Emil Caramizaru said on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people of all ages wait in a row, which stretches from the entrance to the church to the side streets, to pass through the catafalque where the coffin with the body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor is located.
People wait about an hour to reach the Church of St. George New, where groups of 40 people enter.
Approximately 300 people per hour passed through the coffin with the body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor.
Thousands of people from Bucharest, but also from Cluj, Baia Mare, Iasi, Constanta and Craiova came, starting on Tuesday, to pay homage to Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people we had only at the 300-year-old refining of the church and at the Great Feast of St. Nicholas.
"Corneliu Vadim Tudor was at the 300-year refining of the church and stood alongside the members of the Holy Synod, His Beatitude Daniel and the representatives of the five patriarchs who participated in the refining," said the parish priest of the church in the capital, Emil Caramizaru.
According to him, people came with flowers and candles in their hands, sit still and wait in a row, as on a day of great religious celebration.
It is extraordinary the behavior of these people, they sit quietly, with dignity, children, old people, people in carriages, as if they were at a great religious holiday.
"It is exciting to see them waiting to worship and pay a final tribute to Vadim Tudor," said parish priest Emil Caramizaru.
According to him, at the request of the family of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, the church will remain open in the night from Wednesday to Thursday, last night being closed at 01.00 and reopened in the morning at 07.00.

The parish priest wanted to specify that Vadim Tudor often came to this church, especially in the evening, after 8 p.m., and then asked him to open the rack with the remains of St. Nicholas and remained to pray for minutes in sir.
He would come here very often, usually in the evening, after 8 p.m., begging me to open the rag with the relics of St. Nicholas and praying.
He said that this church of Brancoveanu is a great blessing.
He said to me: "Brother Emil, think that here were Brancoveanu, Eminescu, Michael the Brave, who took the hand of St. Nicholas."
“‘You see what a blessing this country is,’ Vadim called me,” the parish priest told me.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor is due to be buried on Thursday, at Ghencea Civil Cemetery, with military honors.
The leadership of the Senate rejected, on Tuesday, the request of Corneliu Vadim Tudor’s wife that the coffin with the body of the former senator be deposited in the hall of the Legislative Chamber.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor was born on November 28, 1949, in Bucharest, he was a writer, politician and journalist.
He was the founder of the Great Romania Party, a former member of the European Parliament and a former senator.
What Happened to Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, having to choose whether or not to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year as part of the Adidas Player Development program, with the Australian coach only playing alongside the Romance at major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who has managed to prevail in front of the capricious sportswoman.
The Adidas program will end at the end of this year, and Halep must decide if he will offer a consistent contract to Cahill or if he will give up the collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We talk and see.
“After Singapore I will be able to give an answer,” Simona told a news conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in tennis today, requesting a contract of about $1 million a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession that he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last race Simona and Cahill will work on together is the Champions Tournament in Singapore.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with Romania’s national team last fall.
The former selectioner confessed that he did not get along with the president of FRF, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus took the decision to leave the national team.
Eventually, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary to stay, but was refused.
I'm not sorry I left the national team.
Then I was sorry, I was leaving a job behind.
So I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector was not normal, I was not respected, my work was not respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he did not know me, he learns different opinions from the press about me.
It did not change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation was in the middle.
I continued the work, everything went very well and probably he changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to go.
If he really wanted me to stay, I proposed a contract extension.
We have about 400 and something of thousands of euros a year, I was going to have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.
“He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group,” Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from the Romanian national team last fall, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 qualifiers.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.
Armored and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police detached Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns at the Serbian border after violent clashes on Wednesday, when water cannons and tear gas were used against migrants who wanted to enter from Serbia, despite Hungary having erected a barbed wire fence.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in the clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has taken care of two children who were injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by any means," Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi's security adviser said.
Police tried to control with water cannons and tear gas the crowd of people who threw plastic bottles, stones and pieces of flooring.
Authorities reported that several dozen migrants broke the fence at the crossing between the towns of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called on Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" migrants from the border.
There are reports that Serbs also supplemented their law enforcement forces at the border.
Following Wednesday’s incidents, Budapest suspended the Roszke-Horgos border crossing for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted effort to close its borders to prevent migrants from entering.
If Tuesday announced that next to the barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia will also raise one on the border with Romania, to the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the raising of a fence on the border with Croatia.
The rare disease a man suffers from
American Nick Hess was suspected by his family to be an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely stand up and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he did not drink alcohol, it was obvious that he was drunk.
When she first accused me of being drunk without a drink, I thought she was crazy.
“But friends and family thought, ‘Maybe he’s drinking alone, he’s an alcoholic in secret,’” he said.
When he saw his wife’s footage with him, the Columbus, Ohio, man simply didn’t recognize himself: “I was looking into my eyes and I wasn’t there.”
"It was awful, I didn't remember anything."
In addition, his wife, who, although she doubted him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick’s breath smelled of alcohol.
The moment that made Nick think the most was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had a blood alcohol content three times above the legal threshold, although the night before he had consumed only one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, his body makes all the carbohydrates consumed ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected this might be Nick's illness was his wife.
The disease hasn’t had a cure yet, but since giving up carbs, Nick hasn’t had such episodes.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest against the services he received from his dealer.
The man “attacked” his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be taken out of service, BT reports.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video went on the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and his family.
His anger arose when the dealer from whom he purchased the car did not solve his problem, as they had agreed.
The government on Wednesday approved the "National Strategy on Immigration for 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is undergoing as part of efforts to modernize the process of managing immigration on national territory", according to a press release.
The strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action that reflect the policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are being considered for the unified and coherent management of situations determined by the possible emergence of an influx of illegal immigrants on the territory of Romania, generated by crisis situations of a political, social, economic or military nature.
“Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay special attention to citizens from countries with potential migration or that may harm national security,” the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in areas adjacent to Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls of the legality of the stay of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the corresponding application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the overall strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating the access to the territory of Romania of third-party citizens who respond to the employment needs, favoring the access of third-party citizens to higher education institutions in Romania for the areas and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government considers that it represents "a means by which concrete activities are established that lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing phenomenon of migration".
Romania, in a European top regarding the labor market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the largest increase in total labour costs among the European Union member states in the second quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to employers’ staff costs.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total cost of labour rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU to increase the cost of labor
The highest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where the hourly cost of labour fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance in labor costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly cost of labor in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded a 5.8% advance in the hourly cost of labour.
Activity report of TVR management, rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
Parliament’s Culture Committees on Wednesday rejected the 2014 activity report of the Romanian Television Society’s Board of Directors.
To reject the report, 17 MPs voted, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the assembled Permanent Bureaux.
They will decide next week.
The next plenary session will be debated.
"I think that in view of this situation it will be done relatively quickly," said the chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Culture, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was common sense" for the TVR leadership to be present at this meeting, as no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was common sense for the TVR leadership to be present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to members as from last night, with an approximate hour that we did not know the time, but today, after the meeting of the reunited Bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the TVR leadership inviting her.
I believe that at the moment you are summoned, you being a budget employee, paid from public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the committees assembled even if you do not like it alive.
"Because it's your duty, you're in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of Parliament's culture committees.
He added that during the meeting the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the budget committees.
The debts we saw and how they continued, came up with the idea that this year would be up to date, but they were not paid from the historical ones.
"I remind you that it is not my fault or the fault of anyone else in these committees that they have lost their leisure time with the banks and the tax authorities, they are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary meeting will follow elections for a new Board of Directors, and this will elect the general director of the institution.
I don’t know who will be nominated for this position.
Miracles will not be done.
The important thing is to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, by their vote will choose with great reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what is going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I do not know who he will be, if you ask me what qualities he must have - common sense in the attitude towards employees because it is a racket of petitions that come from employees, complaints, dismissals.
“When you get 50, 60, 70 reports like this, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster,” he said.
Although he did not appear in the Parliament, TVR President-General Stelian Tanase sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he requested that the Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to saving and guaranteeing the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexing of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to indexing the TV fee, to amend and supplement HG 978/2003 on the fee for the public television service, in order to update the provisions on up-to-date technological changes, as well as to regulate the procedure for controlling the payment of the TV fee and the finding of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision that provides for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTV agents for the collection of TV tax, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission on receipts.
Stelian Tanase asks to reduce the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution for the CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also to amend the law 41/1994, in order to receive budgetary/financial allocations for the acquisition of licenses for major cultural and sporting events - the World Football Championship, the Golden Deer, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTV will go into incapacity for payment in the following months, given that the labor legislation obliges the employer to enforce court decisions, even if they are not final, and wage rights are honored with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has constantly made efforts to reduce expenditures on staff and TV production.
"Thus travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July the TVR News channel was closed," the president's letter said.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by his own efforts.
"Without the support of the state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will sooner or later be unable to carry out its public mission," the letter said.
The Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Culture Committee.
The son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, sent to trial
The son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to trial on Wednesday by prosecutors from the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a case with damages of about 600,000 euros, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, together with his mother, in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga’s daughter, Agathe.
The investigations showed that, in order to evade the payment of taxes to the state budget, the representatives of a company specialized in security services would have created an criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been highlighted.
“In fact, the company’s accounting would have recorded fictitious purchases of services, which, in reality, were not provided, thus damaging the state budget by about 600,000 euros,” the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The Sheikhs have determined the fate of Sanmartean
The Sheikhs of the Al-Ittihad club have determined the fate of Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that the separation of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, manager of coach Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will never happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the titular match and does it well.
The Sheikhs also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave up on him.
There would have been another option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been several discussions, like the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has materialized," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived in Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted vice-president at the Court of Auditors
On Wednesday, the plenary of the Parliament voted to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, there were 290 “for” and 108 “against” votes.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The NLP representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reports.
Moreover, the liberals criticized Sarbu’s appointment to this position and announced that they would challenge it to the CCR, given that he has a file at the DNA, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics.
The PSD senator will hold the position of vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, which remained free after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is set to play the role of a chef in the film "Burnt," the actor made a revelation that his fans did not expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: “I’ve worked most of my life as a cook.”
He revealed that he had worked in the kitchen since the age of 15, when he was working for a Greek restaurant, and then, in college, to continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so his whole childhood he cooked with his Italian grandmother, ContactMusic reports.
Asked what future plans he had at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the kind of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
“It’s not very motivating for me to have a map,” he said.
“I have dreams, things that you would laugh at if I told you,” he said, adding that what he had wanted since childhood had come true.
At the age of 40, however, the actor admitted that he sees himself in the near future directing, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who began directing at that age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned on Wednesday the claims of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta that the political decision-makers in Hungary are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees are fleeing".
“Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, with his irrational statements, offended the whole of Hungary,” the Hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slander.
“His remarks have only one explanation: he has totally lost his support in Romania’s domestic politics,” the Hungarian foreign minister said.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention to and sanction the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials who, in his opinion, “are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union.”
I do not want to respond to the challenges of Hungarian government officials.
"This is a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in terms of the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" Ponta said on Facebook.
The Romanian prime minister added that he is adept at rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, estimating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are no better political decision-makers than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the respective refugees are fleeing!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!", stressed the head of the Romanian executive.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks on Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis "simply a lie," saying the allegations were inappropriate for a 21st-century leader, according to MTI.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the Romanian prime minister's "extremist and lying remarks" stem from the internal political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have said and always say is that I am against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, are nonsense of the Middle Ages and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can receive more, we will receive, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not as our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with the bat and with the insert.
“I don’t agree with that,” the head of the Romanian executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also on Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government in Budapest has decided to start preparations on the ground for the extension of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia to face a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Prime Minister Victor Ponta later said Hungary's decision to raise a border fence did not solve anything about the refugee problem and "takes Hungary out of Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the crane in Mecca?
Saudi authorities said the Saudi giant Binladin Group, which belongs to Osama bin Laden's family, was "partially responsible" for the crash of a crane on Friday at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, killing 107 people.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company did not "adhere to the safety rules," the Saudi news agency reported.
The company’s executives were banned from leaving the country until the investigation into the case was completed.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden’s father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for four years to expand the Great Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday evening during a storm when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong wind gusts, crashed on the eastern side of the roof of the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
In the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How did Hagi shut the mouths of the contestants?
Considered by many the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after his retirement from the activity, as a weak coach, who may not be able to achieve performance and in the new posture.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Star or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at Viitorul Constanta, the team he sponsors.
A year after taking over the team, the King has shown that he is capable of turning a team struggling to save from relegation into a top team.
Thus, after a year, Futurul recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 draws and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, battling in the European cups.
Things took an even better turn for Futurul this season, as the team finished second in Liga 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double that of the Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in the last period in the starting team appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The policy of the club has made Viitorul a team to watch for teams from abroad, so that Hagi sold this summer of 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Alongside Star, Futuro is the only profitable team in League 1, according to the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It’s a legitimate strategy, but then you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh country in the EU.
The big countries come with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, a member of the governing body of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come".
But there are masses that have started and we cannot return history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best as possible and adapt them to us.
In the opinion of Cristian Ghinea, we are in an extremely emotional moment, in which politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: “Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted for the situation now.”
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that, in fact, has not solved anything?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the council.
All the forecasts said he would have the necessary votes.
Prior to the Treaty of Lisbon, the JHA applied the principle of unanimity and any state could block any decision.
This is why things have been very poorly integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, was applied, and the council approved it with the vote of 55% of the states, that is, 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said that the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it is a sensitive issue, there have been reactions of rejection even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel’s policy of opening up and they did not want in many countries to appear as a reaction of the type “the EU sends migrants on our heads”.
They have postponed, so, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave is creating a huge problem for Schengen governance and we will probably see big changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory odds were not really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of the external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the Schengen external border to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece’s border with Turkey is also Germany’s border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the boundaries of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which they first enter, will be renounced because it is not sustainable.
If Greece hoods, you can't say indefinitely that it's Greece's business.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, is it possible to solve it without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism for dividing the effort of reception?
No one knows exactly how the compulsory quotas will work, if they will be reached.
What do you do with a man who doesn’t want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don’t think the European states will start to take over the migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It is likely that there will be some single filtering centers in Greece or Turkey where asylum applications will be processed.
We are working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, they are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have managed to leave, winter is hard to pass the Mediterranean, but we expect next year a wave maybe even greater.
What do we do with these people?
My prognosis is that we will get used to this problem, we will no longer look at it as catastrophically from a media point of view.
You were talking about countries with less or more experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where he has really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I would not go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in the case of other waves of migration, but that does not mean that they do not integrate at all.
There remains an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, the UK.
But purely police means will not work.
Let's create Europe's fortress and illusory.
Integration mechanisms in European societies must be pursued.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take on values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and with one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family including through marriages of convenience.
But the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it doesn’t mean we have to watch them drown in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come.
And if there’s going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don’t believe, it doesn’t mean that the country will recover overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions appear, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders have been closed, walls have been erected, border controls have been reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project at risk?
The European project as such, not the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built minimally enough and set the rules so that the pressure was too great on the countries where these migrants are setting foot for the first time.
I mean, we're moving around freely, but everyone's got their own problems.
In the face of such a wave, it can not be so, because some countries do not cope.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run it doesn’t change much.
After the attacks in France, we don’t have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we did last year.
It's a wave of public excitement that's settling in both directions.
And it’s so unstable from week to week that you can’t make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be manly.
And then, you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and public opinion gets excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real single European market.
And I don’t think Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, which believes that if it pulls the hat over its eyes and plugs its ears, the theme disappears.
Faced with the reality of waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not your small country problem.
We have done this, it is a legitimate strategy, but after that you cannot ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing at the big country level.
The big countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of Romanians for Schengen will decrease greatly.
President Iohannis says it may be good that we have not already entered.
So we move from the desperation of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants see us as an alternative route.
This does not mean that there is a reason not to enter Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become a common responsibility, there will be unique rules for accepting migrants, unique rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its focus on Syria to Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a Russian game?
Russia has frustrated power behavior.
She believes that to be great power is to confuse Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, it is likely that the Assad regime would have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
About two years ago, there was a struggle between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias, backed by Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that it cannot shut down.
But you are great power only if you have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to gain time.
Probably Putin is waiting for offers to be made, to press the buttons to solve the situation.
Offers do not come because the world is not convinced that it can solve in one way or another issues created by it.
But I disagree with the theories that these people are held by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin as stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, that of "Dislike".
On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s co-founder and chief executive officer, announced on his account that this button would be available soon, the New York Times reported on the blog.
Zuckerberg said the “Dislike” button would show a nuance of what a user feels rather than a mere option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wants to avoid the moments when someone posts on his account or an important event in life, and someone else will dislike it.
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said it was not very comfortable for people to "Like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or the death of a family member.
“You may not feel comfortable like that post,” Facebook said.
The new Facebook button has not been welcomed by everyone.
“There’s already enough hatred on Facebook and social media,” Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan said on the New York Times Facebook page, where the article was posted.
"I'm going to dislike the dislike button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, said there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it was hard to imagine that a single button could convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the “Dislike” button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands who came en masse to its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the influx of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, the DPA recalls.
The move attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
“As you can see, this is totally different,” Serbian Refugee Minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Before the new immigration legislation was imposed, a record 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
Also, more than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially Germany.
The "new" seat of the County Council is about to fall.
Two builders in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, in order to move the institution, are falling apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The seat of the County Council on Vasile Alecsandri Street will collapse on its own.
A year and a half after the consolidation and re-functionalization of the building should have been completed, the works did not even reach half.
A final stage in the epic of the building was consummated last days, when the National Council for Dispute Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract for the realization of the technical project for the works that are still to be executed.
The original project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the builder and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company was going to update the technical project, and then a new tender for the works was organized.
"Negotiations were not concluded by a contract, but the CJ felt that the proposed form would be disadvantageous to the institution," summarized R<0xC4><0x83>zvan Timofciuc, a public relations representative at the CJ.
The CJ decision to interrupt direct negotiations was challenged in court by Impex Romcatel.
The outgoing court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which dismissed it as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the CNSC decision to the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it can be considered to find another designer.
Thus, the building’s consolidation works could be resumed at the earliest next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
Work on the consolidation of the former Police Headquarters began in 2011.
A first construction contract was terminated in April 2012, after work of 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The auction was resumed, the contract was awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the firm went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
The work has so far been carried out in a proportion of about 50%.
Initially, the works of consolidation, refurbishment and attic of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
"That's it, I'm telling you everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous Cadastre Office file signed an agreement to acknowledge the facts, against prison with postponement.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, headed by the former boss, Narciza Nedelcu
An adviser from the Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising Office (OCPI) Ia<0xC8><0x99>i accused by DNA in a corruption case has admitted his facts.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was registered yesterday at the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Court, the judges deciding to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu was accused of false intellectual in continuous form and agreed to execute two years in prison with postponement, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
As regards the facts imputed to Dasc<0xC4><0x83>lu, the prosecutors specified that he, as advisor of the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, "did not falsely drafted several minutes of acceptance, prior to selling the contracts of services in keys previously by the O.C.P.I. Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, with the administrators of the companies SC Gauss SRL, CG.
Last days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OCPI were prosecuted in this case, the accusations being the settlement of some services to the aforementioned companies, although the works were not carried out.
Before the trial, it exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
According to FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can only host a major handball competition in 2024, and preparing the women’s national handball team for qualification to the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, declared yesterday, during a meeting with the press, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
Regarding Romania’s national women’s handball team, “the main objective is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for this it has to go through two stages of caudine forks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament”, Dedu said.
We are looking forward to qualifying for the Olympics.
These are fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
The staff will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masseurs, goalkeeper coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to qualify for some things, specifically materials for physical training, which we have never heard of.
These are all to get to the Olympics, and I'm going to do whatever it takes for me to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
But that's the way to perform.
Because at the moment we are in the stone age with preparation.
"The teams we fight with have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who noted that they are trying to obtain the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The FRH president also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility that our country will host a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure issue and it is shameful to be called into question a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let’s not forget that in other corners of the world Olympic quarters were built entirely in a two-year span.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona was a garbage dump, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same was true in London, where the organisation of the 2012 Olympics was also a success in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Ga<0xC8><0x9B>u went civilized with a project, the people gave their consent in principle, but quickly became clear that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that they agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we talk concretely.
“So we have all the openness, both at EHF and IHF, but we don’t have the infrastructure,” the FRH official explained.
The former great handball player avoided evaluating the chances of the women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I asked all the coaches to be booked in the predictions, that if they do not fulfill they will turn against them".
Good road to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players debut on September 23 against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said at a press conference on Tuesday that all the members of the Romanian team are ready for the matches of the World Cup in England, where he hopes to obtain two victories: "We are ready".
Both I and my colleagues are with the engines at full speed.
We trained to give the best performance in all four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let’s take it easy, first with France and then we’ll see.
But if we win against Canada, the match against Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the culmination of so many years of work.
I wish I didn’t disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with good results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor," Macovei said.
The Romanian national team coach Lynn Howells, in his first experience as coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
For me it is an extraordinary experience.
For me it is very important that in every match the Romanians are proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitra<0xC5><0x9F>, is confident that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made in the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be able to live up to the event.
“These guys started playing in Romania’s teams around the age of 18-19, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who have set out to realize a dream,” Dumitra<0xC8><0x99> said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will play in Group D, with the following matches scheduled: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, at Twickenham Stadium in London, with the England v Fiji match in Group A.

14 million lei donated to the "Sf. Spiridon" Hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i to the budget rectification
What will be purchased with this significant amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, following the budgetary rectification, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in modernization and development of clinics, but also in medical equipment and technology for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new CT computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgical interventions, six beds of properly equipped ATI, ophthalmic microscope and other devices necessary to carry out the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and development of the "Great Burn".
From the money from the budgetary rectification, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section.
"In addition, in the next few days we will make the reception of the works from the gateway that connects the UPU to the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the decent transport of the patient from the UPU to the neighboring clinics," the manager of the medical unit explained.
The hospital will soon have in the courtyard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tatarasi, which will be organized outpatiently, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where allergy, hematology and endocrinology are located in the outpatient and will have about 30 beds.
Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, mocked by RATP controllers and a leaflet.
The pity of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither I nor my wife ever want to tread your town again.
Inadvertently, they hit the wrong information in the leaflets, the insensitiveness of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "as the law says".
The spouses arrived in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i a few days ago, checked into a hotel in Centru and asked for tourist brochures.
They also received a leaflet in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the spouses visited Iasi.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to reach the Palas Mall.
Because there was no ticket tonneau at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the leaflet: that they can take tickets by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the leaflet, they got on a bus and tried to send SMSes according to the instructions on the leaflet.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said that the service had been gone for two years and that it had been announced in the press that it had been cancelled.
How do I know what was written in the local press, coming one night before visiting the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation to them, they said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all they could do was give us one fine instead of two (my wife and I).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day to visit the gendarmerie and give statements there!", Ovidiu says.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of the erroneous information on the leaflet and the controllers who “enforced the law to the blood.”
It is not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to recover my money.
It’s not about money, I’m not overreacting to many, but the point is that I felt wrong.
Unfortunate for the rapists.
They had an accident and were in pre-trial detention.
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui has been moved, since yesterday, to the Iasi Court of Appeal.
The judges judged the first term of trial in a non-public hearing in which the seven young people accused of mocking an 18-year-old woman asked to be released.
Before the actual start of the hearing, one of the judges from Iasi to whom the case had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues at the court.
The magistrate worked until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the National Section, being the one who, on April 9, admitted a challenge made by four of the defendants, ordering their placement under house arrest.
Currently, the case is being tried by a panel that includes magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file, Judge Dan An Ton also filed an abstention, on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubinage relationship with one of the lawyers of the rapists.
The two judges decided that the rapists from Vaslui would remain in pre-trial detention.
The prisoners will remain incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when the judges will reconsider the possibility of their release.
The next trial will take place at the Court of Appeals of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i on October 6.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal Iasi, the van in which the rapists from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident in the P<0xC4><0x83>curari district, the car entering Iasi on the belt.
The Iveco van carrying the seven rapists hit a Volkswagen that had come out of Canta road, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van runs from the end of P<0xC4><0x83>cuari.
The car entered Ia<0xC8><0x99>i here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i via Stables, then on the belt road.
They shortened the road by a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called another transport, to take over the detainees.
Soon, a car was sent from the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Maximum Security Penitentiary to the scene of the accident, which took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the detainees were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the arrestees came out at speed, two by two.
"The incident was not reported to the police, because the drivers of the vehicles agreed amicably on the damages to be paid," said Chief Commissioner M<0xC4><0x83>d<0xC4><0x83>lin <0xC8><0x9A><0xC4><0x83>ranu, from the IPJ.
The Great Migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and plainly: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize represent, in themselves, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, amounting to about 1500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants really accept to settle in our localities, the chances of integrating them quickly into Romanian society are extraordinarily small.
I am sure they will be the first to lose patience.
Parasitized by the underworld and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the Gypsies is just a banal example.
Moreover, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, make modern roads, kindergartens or schools, provide decent health care, collect dirt on the street, create honorable paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what causes much wonder is in particular the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
We first encounter the warlike hypocrisy of the strong EU states, which show maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the frightening hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Probably for fear of being robbed of his national being.
Finally, there is a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although invoking only the horrors of war as the reason for leaving, accept no other destination of exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be derided.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, relying strictly on the book of political correctness, they call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even, from time to time, some foreign capital enters the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why are they leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosed, divided and outdated construction.
I lamented the fact that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but here the EU does not have any future plan either.
Improvisations and threats don’t help.
Then, what is the EU for, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
Over the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially Africa towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what is to come.
7,000 euros per year to rent Club Pogor.
The practically imposed destination
The concession auction is for a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of being closed, the club in the courtyard of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for a 10-year concession.
The construction has a useful area of 134 sqm, on two levels of hrub.
CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of literary cafe, bookshop or other cultural activities.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the starting value of the auction was 6,830 euros per year, with a bidding step of 25 euros.
The dealer shall continuously and permanently operate the building and fully cover the costs of the rehabilitation of the building, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period in which the public food unit operated in these spaces and neither after its evacuation were carried out current repair and maintenance work as is currently necessary during the operation of a building," the documentation related to the auction procedure is mentioned.
The club’s concession offers are expected until September 18.
Two brothers from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-olds and 11-year-olds from Tome<0xC8><0x99>ti, brothers, swallowed several diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was undergoing treatment, and the drugs were not hidden.
The children were rushed to the “Sant<0xC4><0x83> Maria” hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
They are in stable condition, as the doctors say.
Exclusive: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20 he received a courageous gift: his biological parents
Lost in the hospital under unclear conditions, in the darkness of the 90s, while she was only two months old, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years in which adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman came out of the house, now a blonde and beautiful girl, and met again and again.
Crina will be 20 years old these days, and her adoptive parents from Palermo have thought about giving their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, in Iasi, to know her unclear past.
The Ia<0xC8><0x99>i newspaper, which witnessed the efforts of searching for the family of origin after a few extremely vague hints, witnessed these meetings that practically break your heart.
The story of the reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the town of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital in the city.
At home, misunderstandings began between the parents, and the mother was forced to leave her home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
He stopped the girl, and I haven't known anything since.
“When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late,” recalls Alina, the girl’s biological mother.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Pa<0xC5><0x9F>cani, and the girl’s father, Costica Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman county.
Their lives were to be permanently separated.
They never found Crina in the hospital.
After his internment, Crina’s father left for work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
“She thought she was abandoned,” says one of the family’s granddaughters.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one has been interested in the fate of the child in all this time, it was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection of Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, which then gave it to the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They immediately fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after some time she would definitely move with them to Italy.
The little girl had already spent nearly two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
“As if my wife had given him life,” Salvadore, the foster father, smiles as he grabs the girl’s weak hand in his palm.
In the country, Crina’s parents, Alina and Costica, continued their separate searches, each wherever they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but received no answer where his child might be.
The police then told her that it is possible that she died, but in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I searched for her here, they told me in court that she was away to Italy, Palermo.
I never had the conditions to look for it.
We prayed to God to be well.
I’ve been thinking about it for all these years, but there was no way we could walk around and find it.
"It's hard", tells us with tears in the eyes the biological mother of Lily.
However, even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past ties her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
“I wanted to meet my parents in Romania,” Crina says delightedly.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romic Ichim, director of the Ia<0xC8><0x99>i Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counseling, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore’s desire to find Crina’s biological family.
The search only started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We only got one name, Balkan Costic<0xC4><0x83>, then the town, Ruginoasa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I could ask if there is a locality with the name received.
Then they gave me some indications, except that the person found was not the one they were looking for.
“It took us about a month to find the girl’s biological father,” said Chief Commissioner Romic Ichim.
In total, it took more than three months for the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially since each one was domiciled in another locality.
We started the proceedings somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of the biological parents and the discussions.
“Then we decided to have a first meeting in September,” Romic Ichim added.
Last weekend, Alina and Costica saw their daughter lost in the hallways of the hospital in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i for the first time 20 years ago.
The father, moved, could barely contain his tears, and his hands trembled unceasingly.
She barely exchanges a few words with those around her.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was still excited, trembling.
"To see your child after all these years, it's something," says a niece, who also came with Costica de la Ruginoasa.
Lily's meeting with her mother and biological brother
In discussions with his daughter, who is about to study at a well-ranked university in Italy, Balkan Coast told him, among other things, that if he ever wants to return to him in the village, he can come quietly: he can give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and dress a household.
My mother is also emotional, she cries, and hardly thinks that something like this could happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think anything like this could happen.
I’ve seen such cases on TV, I’ve been thinking all these years, I hoped, but I didn’t think I could be like that.
They are very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to visit you in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," she tells us with tears on her cheeks Alina, Crina's mother, holding a napkin tightly in her hand.
In him she still hides her tears, of happiness, because soon she will see her daughter after so bitter a time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be in just a few days, this month, 20 years old, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn’t know what to expect, but she has a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
My parents are the ones who raised me.
It will be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina tells us.
First family reunion in Ia<0xC8><0x99>i
In Unirii Square, under the early autumn sky, the family from Ruginoasa once again joins their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishes high school, according to the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
They no longer divide borders or countries, but only one barrier: that of language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iasi, passed easily.
Those who managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do it again.
It’s the first event of its kind organized, with such an emotional load, and I’m glad it’s a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with people who consume drugs, people who are addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give society something good back.
"If I am asked again for such an event, I will do it with great love," says Romic Ichim, the director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counseling Ia<0xC8><0x99>i.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, walks away telling stories.
I understand: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with guns at the foot, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everybody pulls their soul
The camps in the PSD’s outgoing branch have concluded a truce with a gun on their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being also the most tense, the PSD leaders have agreed to temporarily suspend the hostilities.
Pressed by the executive chairman of the party, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing Social Democrats will send him an entire list of potential candidates for the functions of the party.
Far from being over, the party’s internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow the fighters to draw their souls.
He didn’t give an ultimatum.
He has issued a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3, there will be a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of talks over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain was established.
In the October elections, for the position of president of the county branch of PSD, fierce competition is expected.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main office in the outgoing branch of the party are State Secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Laz<0xC4><0x83>r, County Councillor Vasile Catea and Interim President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
To these could be added the mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
One option considered is the candidacy of PSD county councillors leader Cristian Stanciu, in case Lupu will no longer enter the race, sources within the party saying that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that was not mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former leader of the branch, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on election day, candidates can be submitted, and it would not surprise anyone if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new County Permanent Office and all the new management structures," said Cantea.
Until the internal elections are organized, the leadership of the county branch of PSD will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until September 29, with the preparation of the elections being practically ensured by the executive secretary of the branch, the county councillor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions of the last few days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions related to the candidacy for the presidency of PSD Ia<0xC8><0x99>i, with the list remaining open," Stanciu commented.
A judge from Iasi refused the file of rapists from Vaslui on the grounds of concubinage
The seven young people from Vaslui county convicted of rape arrive today at the Iasi Court of Appeal.
The Vasluiians sentenced to sentences between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments for their release today, after the court on the merits, the Vaslui Court, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with magistrate Dan Anton making a request for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked the fact that one of the defendants’ lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter’s concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the highest penalty in this case.
How Judges Motivated the Sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate of the Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young people motivated the sentence.
In the motivation, the judge speaks of the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, specifying that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among public opinion.
"The court finds that after the placement under the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivation of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the accused, their families and local supporters, a strong feeling of indignation was felt at the level of the local and national community.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be a “church door.”
"The court underlines that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, something that the defendants wanted to highlight through the defenses they have made, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," the statement said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
Due to economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past decades can no longer continue the same in the years to come.
By Saturday, very few people knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the UK Labour Party, many wonder how much the choice of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position can affect us.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of the post-war Labour Party.
Declared Marxist, anti-monarchist (he once asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the EU's "Russia Today" TV channel and the U.K. wants to re-arme the U.K. and the U.S. to re-terrorist movements)
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is close to preferable to the United States.
Following the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what Tsipras said and promised in Greece until he came to grips with the real world and economic ties.
The economic program of the new Labour leader includes, among other things, massive renationalizations and the printing of money as a solution to finance development projects and to cover very generous social benefits.
Sure, some may wonder why the solution with printing money is not unanimously adopted in the world, we would then have a global general prosperity!, but who else to avoid such details.
Sure, we can tax the bankers to death, become a kind of enemy of the left, but as has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterrand and Hollande.
The additional sums are quickly swallowed up by the generous, uncovered promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher put it, “The problem with socialism is that at some point the money of others runs out.”
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in convictions as the new party leader, failed miserably in the election.
And at that time there was still a relatively consistent and structured working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word.
And the unions were sensitively more influential than they are now.
In the new industrial landscape, where services dominate the workforce as a whole, and extensive automation has made the industry massively need high-skilled workforce, Corbyn’s rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times considers that Corbyn’s election increases the chances of Brexit, i.e. Britain’s exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership of the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and you look at the refugee crisis shaking from the foundations of the EU, you end up with an explosive mix.
And not just for the UK.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which should take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the whole European project and the deep failures created inside it by the Euro crisis and now that is why refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
All the more so because for a whole series of member states, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin is becoming more and more the dominant actor anyway).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong advocates of the country’s stay in the EU.
But today’s Europe is no longer the same as it was in the past.
There are many resentments, which increase in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we even had a sample recently in Jean Clude Junker’s speech, increasingly tends to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly Germany.
And this is happening as the electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration groups that are at the same time Eurosceptic grows spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the negatively charged emotional climate has reached higher odds than ever in the past.
Hence the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when evaluating the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that starts from the national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn’s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today’s politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we see a more pronounced integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the states in the region to the periphery of interest and to that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feeds his populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
Due to economic and demographic causes, the prosperity enjoyed in the last decades, the generous social benefits, can not continue the same in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Eurozone - immigration, both provoked by hasty decisions that have taken into account only integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulences on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can greatly affect the situation of Romania.
And it's hard to rule out anything from the perspective of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brancusi, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
"Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to be heard about all over the world.
But behind its reputation lies something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That thing also has a name.
It's called trickery.
What to write about Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i?
What else is there to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the banknotes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in an advertising clip.
Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i produces and delivers money almost 60 years ago when he is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
The author of this article lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes outside with his son, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to Brancusi".
The country is surrounded by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Nor did the communists succeed in removing it from Romania’s memory and culture.
Its citations now span the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then again, what else to say, to write about this man?
Viewed from the pile of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s life seems almost fantastic, totally improbable.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you haven’t been lucky enough to be born in some big city and in a wealthy family, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Perhaps this is where the following text should begin.
With a sentence, however detestable they may be.
Forget the stupid success stories, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on TV.
Look closely at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how he succeeded in life, how, today, he heard of a whole world?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brancu<0xC8><0x99>i was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobita, a small village in Pe<0xC8><0x99>ti<0xC8><0x99>ani commune, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancusi.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i led a modest life, but one of which would collect the landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre <0xC8><0x9A>u<0xC8><0x9B>ea, from Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people have lived happily a patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from one season to the next.
Do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has come down to us.
But Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i’s childhood was far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor’s years spent in his hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the "boiler" was made, following those who taste the liquid to see if the process is proceeding properly, Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills the palms of his hands with water and drinks on his own.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
First people notice after a few minutes.
The mother panics, then becomes hysterical, believing that her son is dead.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by praises, he sees in the distance the desperate signs of those who are waiting for him with their hearts open.
The party immediately turns into mourning.
The father is already thinking about burial.
However, someone finds it good to call Baba Brandu<0xC5><0x9F>a, a servant of the Cheesecakes.
The lady checks the baby’s breathing, then puts horse dung under his nose, gathered around him.
The baby sneezed loudly.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further in his drunkenness of joy, the party with bragging continues with even more force.
The next day, father and son meet in the orchard.
Radu Brancu<0xC8><0x99>i asks Constantine to gather some rods and bring them to him.
The father puts his child on his head and, with the rods brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the sting of the blows, the little Brâncu<0xC8><0x99>i has the revelation that the world can be looked at from another perspective and that things around can appear upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would recognize in old age, if not the star itself participated in his disturbance.
Had the sun been as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?
At the moment, the city is not working.
A parliamentarian appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for him.
The independent deputy Viorel Bl<0xC4><0x83>ju<0xC8><0x9B> called on the PSD and the PNL to stop the internal struggles and to reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great division and that is it.
I haven’t seen any of the USL projects from 2012 continue.
Neither highway nor Regional Emergency Hospital, see only how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let’s put politics aside, get together and talk.
At the moment, the city is not functioning.
"If you're busy with internal warfare, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blaju<0xC8><0x9B> said.
He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed the electorate of Iasi, the consequence being a very low presence in the upcoming local elections, around the figure of 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The deputy also believes that the voters will also turn to traditional parties, expressing their reservation towards new political initiatives, such as the "For Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break from the right-wing electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on civic active people, who are usually right-wing.
"The right is shattering even more, which is not good for anyone, not even for the PSD," Blaju<0xC8><0x9B> said.
He said he was not interested in a candidacy in the upcoming local elections, debunking rumors about his intention to enter the race for mayor.
I also said I don’t want to run for any local office.
I am still thinking about whether I will continue as an MP in the next term.
I tried to appeal for unity for Ia<0xC8><0x99>i and in the discussions on the halls, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make my image.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
