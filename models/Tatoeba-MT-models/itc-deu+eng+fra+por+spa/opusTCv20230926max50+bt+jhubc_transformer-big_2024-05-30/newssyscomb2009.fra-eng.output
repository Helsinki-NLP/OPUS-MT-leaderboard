Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of the current president Wilhelm Molterer was seriously threatened, suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remain, with 29.8 percent of the vote, the country's leading political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the vote.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP, which with 25.6 percent lost nearly nine percent of the vote, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; especially for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
As early as July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But the voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of the leader of the party and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were pronounced.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, at the extraordinary council of the party’s leadership.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election result which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the great coalition SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free parties (FP<0xC3><0x96>) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven per cent of the votes - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a rehearsal of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still a unified government of the European Union, it was in 2005 that the BZ<0xC3><0x96> was elected.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently based on this evolution.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell, among the Austrian political parties, from third to fifth position.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four percent limit and entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are at risk of cooling
If the problem of Czech researchers accused in India of illegally picking cockroaches could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, which took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, as he exited the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was discharged from the prosecution and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could then ask for bail and await trial on bail, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same way during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, as a result of which he could be pardoned," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such aid was already being provided to them by India.
Above all, we want to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues for many years.
The Indians recognize it too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a gross misconduct," he said.
The minister evaded the question of whether he had obtained a promise from India to deal with the case.
"I've already received a large enough number of promises," he said.
A Czech Referee Fights for the Seabed
It is approaching an electronic wall map, on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are represented.
Now, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area, however, is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and the Law of the Sea.
Its leader, the director of the division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The ardor at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world little known until now, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms that are currently unknown, which may hold the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A fund wider than the land
Nowadays, coastal states have begun to aspire vehemently to new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they are in fact availing themselves of their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, be entitled exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone,” explains Mikulka.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf, must be supported by a wide scientific-technical documentation, based on many exploration and costly metering.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the Commission has dealt with five applications, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia’s success as the first country to significantly expand its underwater holdings has recently made a worldwide impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, is 1.6 million square kilometers, which represents the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The future benefit they will derive from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they anticipate, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their applications.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There is no longer any state that enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"However, make no mistake, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka, adding that "its areas are clearly defined and their regime is anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it was granted the status of a so-called "pioneer investor" by the Convention, as well as by investors from a few other States.
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is hectic, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
“It is possible to extract it on an expanse with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," lists Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a concreteness.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German Special Forces were there for the release of the hostages.
The Egyptian government had requested Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are being revealed.
According to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists from the Federal Army and officials from GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk, were on the scene.
As the ministry spokesman said Monday night, German forces were ultimately not required, as the hostage-takers released their prisoners and fled when they acknowledged the imminence of a forcible release.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the assistance offered by Germany to integrate it on the spot as a support force.
"Fortunately, this has not happened so far," a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry said.
The attackers had abducted in the south of Egypt the group of tourists made up of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were taken to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has so far remained vague, as have details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were rescued in the meantime have arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five vacationers and special forces are expected to have taken off aboard an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress narrowly thwarted the $700 billion bailout of the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout in favor of financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to quell the chaos of the financial markets did not win a majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the supporters had desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-founded 700 billion dollar plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called for a vote in favour of the bill, although the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones was down more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concern that the state bailout could overturn.
It went back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into effect, approval and approval of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
The organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak economic outlook, Germans’ thirst for travel remains insatiable, according to the study.
In terms of bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded sales of more than 31 percent compared to the same period last year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) said Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing booking numbers already dominate the autumn months.
The sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent more compared to 2007, said the DRV.
The sources of these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyzes monthly booking data from 1,200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low dollar price, travel to the US would be particularly in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about one-third.
Alongside this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought after destinations by the Germans.
Specially organized trips are in high demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be "easier to calculate for the customer than for an individually arranged trip".
Consumers can save money among other things with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very popular so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, beer in liter pitchers and celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television host and wears a custom-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers jump on us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the equator of the Weißwurst, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was hitherto limited.
But once in the Thérèse square, everything is half less worse.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; nobody looks blasted or embarrassed – that’s completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume picks up a few strange eyebrows at the banana-chocó stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out that I would have tied my apron wrong: "to the left means free, to the middle virgin, to the right married, to the back widow."
Discreetly, I tripped my buckle from the back to the left.
“It’s better,” she said and laughed.
Others don't give as much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which it is written "Too drink to get dressed!" and exposes their naked tail without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time to the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "oooooo" lying down.
He tells me all this after being relieved of the cup he had drunk before.
Right next to that fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
Bob is therefore one of those infamous "wild pissers".
Others are not lucky enough to be able to get rid of alcohol this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, a group of rescuers rush to the square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer festival: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the stuffed under the tarpaulin are not visible.
"These are the ones who can no longer swallow anything," one of the rescuers yells at me in response to my question, then disappears in the melee.
Accident Victim Identified by Police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in Friday afternoon’s city crash on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there later.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed in a Neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation tower at each of its corners, as some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The entire building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we no longer have any doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, lagging behind the game of imperialism, wished to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as in the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points serves - at least symbolically - to underline the broadening of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a bed car heading for the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP Turkish AKP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 and a half hours, shaken on noisy tracks whose cadence recalled the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital – presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning away from its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and particularly Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built of stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and many pastries in which middle managers in suit-tie-men and women-meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for both of them.
She had to do both.
"But now at some point, 'I asked if' Turkey shouldn't choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone I was able to talk to recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway not only goes to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I thought of these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been called "the sick of Europe".
At least, there is no longer any doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include the under-21s, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20-years-old refused to abandon the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to handle any type of music that was presented to it, whether it was madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and this thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod used to tell us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything is there, in the music.
So sing!"
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he elevated it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver were to be knighted, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he drove the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the last 40 years, I've seen over a hundred of his shows, and I can honestly say that none of them ever disappointed me - and, sometimes, they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, “focus only on certain people.”
He will be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died 25 September) states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Hopper-Norma research, while doing a BSc, MA and PhD".
That's what comes from the Woodruff author's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Hops, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition 'Flamenco and Life' because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second assault for Honda's super-sales
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had good habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
Added to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, it should be emphasized that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the market release of the first generation.
First of all, it can be seen that Honda has refurbished this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case of Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a sales growth of 17% in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda sales in Spain.
The heads of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to overcome in large part the drop in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand officials hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, that is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease in sales of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also expects to achieve a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters in length - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the other half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change to 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and so is the interior space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a gasoline reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the trunk capacity – which has a dual bottom system – can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity compared to the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation – in addition to exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof – is improved access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine delivers 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This thruster - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a gasoline consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have crafted this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of Nissan’s safety shield.
This robot will allow the vehicles of the brand to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee's compound eyes, capable of seeing in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is known as a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurcating its wheels by 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Displacement Laboratory and lead engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
Every second this device must only process information and act on that data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first bus to develop new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced in series cars in a decade according to Nissan.
The robot operates with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device on a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not devoid of geniuses.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages from solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say 'the Hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Maitre d'Hôtel makes us think several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it.
Surely this game gives useful but little detailed information.
It’s more of a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It is better than nothing, since it is unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry into the table of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will disburse nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new welcomed by a sharp fall in its stock price.
A week after unveiling a provisional deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at the unit price of $25.25, a total amount of $3 billion.
The retained price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
Morgan Stanley was down 6.79% at $23.07 around 5 p.m. GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, CEO of Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities but put it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's executive director, told Tokyo, "we thought the stake would be entirely made up of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into common shares if the latter are exchanged more than 50% above the conversion price, or about $47, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to show a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" eased its balance sheet since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been challenging for the group, which has seen its stock price melt by half as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt flew away.
This cost fell on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Re-founding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, it was the third to put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of the voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, he had to obtain half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out outside the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa claimed the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night.
"The Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly," he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place quietly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), focused on a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the state's power over the economy, reserving it the "development planning" of a country living essentially from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Supported by Correa, who was elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the head of state, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and run for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando has launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back safe and sound to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at around 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft at al-Maza military base, which is attached to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in “good health” and “no ransom has been paid” to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from one hideout to the other by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 Special Forces personnel, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the assault on the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing," the official said, who requested anonymity.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "blitz" unit had been sent in total to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian diplomat Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle in which the kidnappers were, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement-United (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupying the current election campaign.
I'm fine.
But one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the sums of misery that are granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and this, in consultation.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with three under heaps of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, protesting with the energy of despair when promoters and policy makers throw their bulldozers at our forgotten stones and cemeteries.
When, a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European bank in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalizing it.The three countries support, with a sum of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also having interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this case, also appealing to the European Central Bank and the head of competition of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been escalating for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (to the tune of 49%) of the capital of the bank located in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell some of its holdings, including primarily the mainly insurance activities it acquired last year from the Dutch agency ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to let go of bankruptcy.
On Friday alone, the company’s shares fell 12 percent to their lowest level of 14 years ago.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company’s executives, is not realistic.
The company’s management accuses the overseas uncertainty, related to the adoption of the US $700 billion bailout, of being the cause of the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, papers already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial body was also looking for private acquirers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they were not going to lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank’s customer circle and no agency was stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that bind the use of information regarding the prescription of medicines, in any case, to the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program has to be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting your henhouse to a fox,” Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the insured capital in case of damage dependent on the health of the client who presents himself, and if they feel that the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent candidates for medical examination, and they did not sign an insurance contract with them until they were aware of the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily obtains from pharmacies, data about the person's drug purchases in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers from and what is his state of health.
For example, if that person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol-lowering, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is not much left to do to the insurer aside from paperwork. However, tiny problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is seen by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others do not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data, they must ask the patient for permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctioned for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory analyses and linking them with data on drug use, thus being able to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time, control of use is becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope of action extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill to enlarge the circle of control of the authorities on companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the data subject.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance companies do not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus, in the end, chickens depend on the fox’s benevolence.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this topic also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit, where cooperation in the field of atomic energy will be discussed.
The European Union recognizes that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given a broader say in international affairs, but member countries have yet to agree on their support in New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this question, yesterday, at this 9th summit held in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would double the trade, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious target.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India concerning civilian flights, thus allowing air trade to flourish in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, the EU's largest trading partner, on the one hand, and New Delhi, on the other, which ranks only ninth among EU partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on this issue has been raised.
Completion of the Doha trade cycle was also called for, although both play a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate agenda, including its desire to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20% until 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as on the need to pass a global market at next year's climate conference, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is visiting the French capital today, where during a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the news agency, the agreement would be for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, during the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: indeed, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the meeting with the press in the Room Struktur, at the butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books is gradually decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular, in relation to that for adults and children.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau 3,000 meters above sea level in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: “The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one that Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared.”
The sheriff said no human remains were found on or around the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was deemed dead.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Safety (NTSB) reported that a few hours after the wreckage was located, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal belongings of Fosset were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
By the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002 the first man to complete the round the world in an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had circled the world by plane and non-stop.
Among all these records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters high, in the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you're not expecting.
An unusual 4x4 with an original and well-defined design, marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the last born of the off-road "compact" of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Precisely because of its non-standard content, unexpected and unconventional will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17th.
Thus, the hype that will accompany the beginning of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication involves the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that when looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of motorsport communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see well.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, has never created any big problems.
He had never been in a fight with the opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) from Campania and Apulia were added.
They had three-colour flags on which their hometown appeared: Saturday night, they were all abducted so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found a fan base of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The FIGC had made available to Italian fans, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then will take action: in this case, it could be that the arrested or identified tifosi in the disorders will purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits attendance in Italian stadiums, but also in European ones.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now is the time of fear-emulation: that is to say, others may be added to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes wide open especially in view of the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, on Tuesday, the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say, the secret services, which deal precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duke-Duce choirs, and the outstretched arm during the Mameli hymn? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
This is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where resides a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 supporters was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Observatory - crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had stayed in the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s hymn: those too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not polite.”
