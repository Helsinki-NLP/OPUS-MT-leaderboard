Where's the exit?

I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
I study at Hyogo University.
We will participate in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went smoothly.
Nobody wants to help us.
They speak very fast.
Tom was lucky at first.
It is urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He didn’t have the money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there a lot of sharks around here?
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
He's from Sweden.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with fangs.
I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't that funny, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20.
It's a nice picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom is not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom's working here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have any plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had a good time.
It's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom was angry.
I'm old.
I have a dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English at a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy some books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What is your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody, get out of here.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say things like that.
From bad to worse!
Jim is Canadian.
You did well here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm relaxed.
The cattle were grazing in the field.
He interfered in his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for a date.
Tom is still absent.
I ate the whole apple.
Roast the bhakri while the pot is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only prepare Uyghur food.
We're leaving Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing football.
Stop stammering.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I meant it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
You're good at this game, aren't you?
Take care of them.
I live in Fiji.
Do you want to eat with us?
Doesn't seem too surprised.
I don't go to school on Saturdays.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom is treacherous, isn't he?
Is this cage meant to protect from sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
You don't want a job?
I played the trombone when I was younger.
I'm faithful.
Can you write in Braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I got him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You need to become more active.
Are Tom and Mary kidding?
Smoke broke.
I have no choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What will you do this summer?
He got irritated.
Can you speak Shanghainese?
It shrunk because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
He's still there with you, isn't he?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village had died after sunset.
What is your favorite female rapper?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's good to see you so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why are you leaving early?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a conference.
There is no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
You're a little overweight, aren't you?
Who is the man playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his income on drinking.
Search harder on Google!
That's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see you.
Does that sound familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When is your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.
He promised to write to me every week.
I was not born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a wealthy girl from Boston.
I forgot if he drinks wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I will give 50,000 for this statue. Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I plan to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I shave almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't spoken to him yet.
It was a hot summer evening.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for the car keys.
I don't really want to talk.
So it must be Argentinian.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more cautious.
She's shaken.
He should have done it yesterday.
I am a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your fate is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
Nobody wants to help you.
It will clear in the afternoon.
He went blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that picture?
How many continents are there in the world?
He's good at singing, isn't he?
Tom's mad at Mary, isn't he?
His idea is superior to yours.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom's getting emotional.
I was just scared.
Tomorrow's a party.
I drank too much beer yesterday.
I would like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy.
I appreciate your intuitions.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still sleeping.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but as you wish.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He plays the drum.
Must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use the most?
Light the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before coming to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German cars are among the best.
Call 'em.
That's cool.

You'll plow the field.
He came to listen to jazz.
You really think Tom's handsome?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I might know someone who can help you.
Do you know how to ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a model.
She brought me a cup of sugar-free tea.
It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
The fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue out.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
You want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose what you want.
I'm at the hospital, I was struck by lightning.
Did you call them?
Turn off the radio.
Why did you decide to become a teacher?
It was a really scary story.
He's in the van.
I don't introduce them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe it? We are in Europe!
I waited for a bus to arrive.
He found the bug.
You'll never guess where I am.
I wasn't doing well.
You students are required to be diligent.
I won't be able to help them.
It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You are interested in politics.
Many people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I can't drive very well.
I heard Tom's learning to drive.
You know I love you deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is, we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I shot down the branch with an axe.
The mini skirts are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least 6:00.
I have a lot of work to do by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
Are you Mary?
After dinner walk on the beach.
Why didn't you go with him?
He's two years older than him.
French is hard.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You've got the wrong number.

I have known him for over ten years.
We are grateful for the music he left us.
It's not like the idea of putting an ammonia appliance in my house attracts me a lot.
Judy is a very smart student.
We knew that the dog would run after the cat.
I'm a cop.
You kissed her, didn't you?
Why don't I just buy you a hat?
I thought Tom would come out alive.
You're pale to bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom is my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
Do you like the mountain?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
Come on board.
You're charming.

The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a difficult start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
You again!
Why do these things always happen to me?
The birds are catching ground.
The park is closed on Monday.
Didn't you even update the firmware?
I have a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do it now?
All my friends like them.
I like my tongue.
Why don't you answer me?
We're Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's practicing.
You're coming in?
Which way should I start?
Did you study Darwin's theory of evolution?
His horse had a heart attack.
It is worth visiting the ruins.
He should be ready for the worst.

This reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember your license plate number?
He told us a lie.
She has seven children.
Let's listen to music.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Take him to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We have to postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We were separated.
It's really early.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
This happened to me.
He has a lot of friends in America.
I didn't live in Boston last year.
Are you reading this book tonight?
Does Tom have a car?
I'll be fine. Don't worry.
Tom rarely laughs.
I can't forget her smile.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know any Canadians living in Australia?

I'm perfectly happy here.
Do you like it?
What exactly do you want Tom to do?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom didn't like it very much.
Could you wash the dishes, please?
Lunch was great.
You turned off the computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remembered that.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
I felt the door close.
You made him get drunk.
How are you feeling today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You're stubborn.
I don't feel nervous.
You have a nice dog.
What do you really want to do?

They were perfect.
What are you going to do this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the fox with its leap has reached the quiet Fido.

Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.
How about we go out for a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Do Tom and Mary sing?
Are Tom and Mary okay?
Trading is common in markets.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Don't bother them.
We were good.
She started behaving strangely.

Tell us something.
You're random.
Please turn the music down.

Say it again, please.
You're upsetting her.
Sami is not here to ruin your day.
I took my shoes off.
I am learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Are those hers?
The woman is drinking water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it will soon close its doors if the food doesn’t taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.
I'm free tonight.
You think I'm too tall?
What are we supposed to do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
Were you blindfolded?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrists.
You seem relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He doesn't listen.
I bought it at a used store.
Why don't you do it yourself?
It's finally here!
Tom thinks they'll all be here by noon.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It's meaningless.
You're lying.
She helped him.
Everyone was talking about it.
You're telling me you're not busy?
He hates clubs.
Just go home.
Tom told me Mary was busy.
Where's my money?
Nobody's seen them do it.

I have to go to work now.
You came too early.
He is able to speak ten languages.
Come home before it gets dark.
I got off the train at the wrong station.
I hated French in high school.
Aren't you supposed to be home with your mom?
She has blue eyes and blond hair.
I don't get it.
Tell him who you are.
My name sounds weird.
I will never forget that night.
Be cheerful! Add an exclamation mark to all your sentences!
Can you see something in there?
You're ready.
Why should I talk to them?
I won't forget.
I don't want to forget her.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I bought a pair of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.

I wasn't going to hit Tom so hard.
You make me vomit.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock's broken.
I won't wait forever.
Just give the order.
Do you know any Canadians living in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
I hope Tom isn't angry.
The rock was moved with dynamite.
Mary made breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was the Mona Lisa?
He said he needs to go.
You can keep them.
This smell is unbearable.
She became famous.
What are you pointing at?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
You stitched the balloon.
We gotta go.
Staying at home is not fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like his son to study more.
I opened an account at a nearby bank.
I didn't like that one.
Can you be sure?
It was good to see you.
You don't have to worry.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He clearly wants to go.
I knew Tom would do something romantic.
How much paper do you need?
Can you confirm?
It was a waste of money.
Tom's talking to Mary on the phone.
Bring some wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It costs only one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture on.
You're my three best friends.
Did you try to talk to him?
Where did he have lunch?
You're the last person who can tell a lie.
Even June is not that far away.
Why do you hate Tom so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He threw me out of the house.
My shoes got wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you going to leave me?
You've always liked Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me some questions?
Don't make fun of Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I took risks.
Two people were killed in a car accident.
You know Tom, right?
It wasn't my idea to hire them.
Last night my grandmother passed away without suffering.
I know why you're mad at them.
You know Tom likes cars.
You passed the exam.
Tom imitated Mary.
I can easily read Spanish.
Do I need to use ink?
Don't fall off the chair.
Tom sent us some Christmas presents.
Tom can't swim?
Children usually get up early at Christmas.
I will be your guide.
How long do you study English every day?
Why does he look grumpy?
There's nothing I can do for you.
The father is good.
I think they're ready.
Tom will try it again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a board game.
Everybody believed him.
It means a huge increase in the use of air conditioning, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.
I'm a drug addict.
Those are crocodile tears.
He might have said something earlier.
The work leaves traces on Tatoeba...
Do you like carrots?
I have pain every 30 minutes.
Tom is much older now.
Tom's better.
I think Tom is pessimistic.
You have to help them.
Sometimes I write to my mother.
Don't trust anyone.
I regret never being kind to him.
Have Tom call me.
It hasn't changed anything.
She's not wearing her hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too early.
I should have eaten more.

To love someone is to see them as God intended them to be.
Don't lie to them.
Do they live with her?
I don't know how he did this.
I'm not sure George's gonna like this idea.
They are afraid to say it publicly.
Please, identify yourself.
You're leaving us.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I lost him.
I almost dropped the dishes.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom called 911.
We are brother and sister.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
This week has been beautiful.
You want a tray with that?
You don't know me.
Nobody wants to work.
Please drive slower.
How do we fix it?
This is last month's magazine.
They're not back yet.
He's about your age, isn't he?
It's backwards.
We can't let them die.
It's a bundle of nerves.
Tom was late.
Tom was left behind.
This will be discussed tomorrow.
How did you spend your holidays?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved to the home of country music in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary corrected it.
Have you ever talked to him?
I don't think Tom will be able to do that.
When did you come back from London?
Tom is always in a good mood.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom leaned over for a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, right?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It looks so fake.
They're all dead.
I don't want you in my car.
A morse snake, Tom.
I don't care about you.
Don't say anything!
I think you're right.

Send it in the mail.
It's interesting, isn't it?
Mary accidentally bumped into Tom.
I'm nobody's enemy.
I forgot your number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to be honest?
What are you going to do?
Tom seems tired, take him home, please.
May all your wishes come true!
He's already done it.
He is experienced with a word processor.
He was at the death gate.
You're hurt, aren't you?
Your table is ready.
Is it going to be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, don't they?
Now let's talk.
I can't solve this problem.
It hit him in the head.
It'll be a lot of fun.
Tom told Mary what not to do.
Do your own thing!
It was extremely frightening.
I'm telling a story.
You're homesick, aren't you?
What will you eat tomorrow?
I've seen the movie before.
Sophie, who was hungry, ate everything she could get.
Is that Tom and Mary?
There is no future in his employment.
Tom and I often study together.
Tom and Mary are very happy here.
Do you like to travel?
I want to go back to Tom's house.
It has strong principles.

Again, bye.
So lucky to meet you here.
Are you waiting for someone?
You're an overly optimistic girl.
Is this your umbrella?
I don't know three languages.

We need some sleep.
We are in Calgary!

I speak English.
Tom and Mary are young and attractive.
I'm done watering the flowers.
Here's what to do.
Tom asked Mary out several times.
I tried to save her.
I'm not interested in your opinion.

How long have you been gone?
How am I supposed to eat?
I'm surprised Tom can't speak French.
He was playing the piano.
I can take you home.
I'll call you tomorrow.

The supreme treasure is knowledge, the central treasure is children, and the lowest treasure is material wealth.
That would be risky.

It ruined my life.
It's not very likely that Tom wants to do it.
You're really good.

You're a part of me.
She took her brother to the zoo.
You look perfect.
I'm actually a bastard.
I don't want to sit next to her.
Look at that!
They know who he is.
Let's open it.
It is sickness to be obsessed with victory, it is sickness to be obsessed with using martial arts, and it is sickness to be obsessed with presenting everything you have learned. It is sickness to be obsessed with attack, and it is sickness also to be obsessed with defense. It is sickness also to be obsessed with getting rid of the disease. Fix your mind obsessively on whatever is considered

He was seen crossing the road.
I'm like my brother.
I'll go.
Do you really think it's necessary?
Everyone who came on the road was surprised.
Who's that?
Write your name here.
You're very selfish, aren't you?
I could try.
He got lost while walking through the woods.
How long will you stay?
Tom and Mary are really jealous, aren't they?
They gave an answer to every question.
Please fill your forehead.
I came here to learn.
Drink the medicine.
I can see a pattern.
He was unable to attend the party.
Do you still collect stamps?
It's not for them.
They're both good.
He spilled his drink on my tuxedo.
Why don't you wear that hat anymore?
The report was soon known throughout the country.
I love your daughter.
Are you as bored as I am?
Mary kissed her father on the cheek.
What kind of beer do you have?
We are used to living in a big city.
They are our dearest friends.
The climate of Japan is generally mild.
I had three exams today.
I had no idea she was coming.
I'm sorry, but I'm not paid enough to worry.
Where do you keep your bottle opener?
Don't you understand yet?
Can you teach me how to play chess?
What time should I wake you up?
There's no one here.
You should apologize to them.
I would like to buy a dog.
Layla wondered where Sami was.
Take Tom out.
I was happy at the time.
I told him I'm not hungry.
Tom's messy, isn't he?
They said they were embarrassed.
Please, take them.
Please, go home.
I like professional wrestling.
Tom is clever.
Don't be so formal, please!
You think that's a clue?
I don't think Tom's jokes are particularly funny.
He does everything very quickly.
Please, don't kill me!
I bit my lip.
You're a moralist.
She's always been a hothead.
She likes beans.
I'm having trouble falling asleep.
The relief is instantaneous.
Lida is a close friend of Mary's.
Please don't interrupt me while I'm talking.
I hope to participate.
I never lied to her.
She ate an apple.
Don’t judge people by appearance.
She's jealous.
Right, I understand what you mean.
You'll be safe here.
Are you proud of your father?
Tom is rude.
You have already been to Berlin.
You are too young to be in love.
Stay awake.
Tom, where did you put my passport?
Now lie down.
He finally decided to get married.
Can I use your phone?
Can't we do anything?
The relationship "A loves B" is not reflective, transitive or symmetrical.
Add more salt to the soup.
You just have to sweep the floor.
Don’t give a child more money than you need.
Tom thinks Mary lied.
I won't talk about it.
I'm a fucking economist.
Tom wouldn't understand.
You want something to drink?
I'm here to help you.
He was too drunk to drive home.
I heard voices.
I respected Tom.
So what happened next?
She's ready now.
Go play with him.
Now go brush your teeth.
I can't fire them.
He had a shot of anger.
Don't make any noise while you're eating the soup.
Please, go to the supermarket and buy some fruit.
I realized I wasn't ready.
Mr. White went to Canada.
Do you think Tom is funny?
You're not sure you're going back to your husband's house.
I'm gonna pile it up right now.
He said he wasn't interested.
What does the note say?
I don't have to be accountable to you for my actions.
Mr. Gomez did not apologize for my mistake.
Is he a foreigner?
I think you're perfect.
Let's send them all home.
The thermometer marks three degrees below zero.
Although Marcel works hard, he earns only 30,000 Canadian dollars a year.
Where did you give them?
Can you give me a euro?
Tom was the only one who wasn't eating.
I don't want to do anything against the law.
Evaluate your progress.
How many rides do these buses have approximately every hour?
She wasn't a very good pianist.
Do you have cats?
Women like men with mustaches.
He fell from the tree.
He will contribute to this project.
The tree is sick.
Tom will probably be bored.
It was a good choice.
The frost caused a lot of damage to the crops.
Tom deserves an explanation.
Try to think about it.
Are you ready to study Klingon?
Who wrote "The Prince"?
I'll pretend this never happened.
Sometimes a little pride is what we need.
Tom lost his money, his family and his friends.
He lives here completely alone.
He convinced me.
Fortune has nothing to do with it.
You kissed him, didn't you?
Why isn't Tom here today?
That should be interesting.
He moved west to Nashville, Tennessee.
I'll call you back later.
Where do you want to go?
Tom knows exactly how Mary feels.
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
Tom didn't tell you?
He misled me.
Can rabbits swim?
Sami was trying to learn Arabic.
You've gotten taller.
Call my wife.
They'll understand.
You read an article.
She couldn't come because of her illness.
Sometimes he's late for school.
My son is brushing his teeth.
I have always liked this restaurant.
I couldn't understand anything that Tom said.
Dogs are territorial.
Tom's playing in the park.
Can someone open the door, please?
I was just doing my duty.
I want to ask them when their big day is.
Feed the bird.
You know I love Tom, right?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
He's coming at noon.
You're a busy person, aren't you?
Tom asked everyone to leave.
I'm very frustrated.
She cried when she heard the terrible news.
I'm afraid it's too late to say no.
You're important.
He persuaded his wife not to divorce him.
My answer matches yours.
There is no life without electricity and water.
I'm right. I'm right.
They won't see me without a date.
She threw her boyfriend out of the house.
Have you ever written a letter to Mary?
He behaves very timidly in his presence.
Tom is spoiled.
It's probably a mistake.
He is a famous painter and should be treated as such.
Our cities create serious pollution problems.
Tom has a job.
How dare you talk to me like that!
Tell him to leave.
I like autumn more than anything.
Tom is suspicious.
The good news is that we will be able to help you.
I usually take a bath before going to bed.
What I want is a word processor.
What brought you to Boston?
Do I bother you sometimes?
You want me to leave now?
We are outraged.
I hope you had a great day!
I'm feeling stressed.
Mary laughed.
We all wanted revenge.
Tom will never agree.
I'm diligent.
I'm sure they're talking about us.
I'm lucky today.
He looks like a baboon.
"Do you have a dog?" "No."
He has a strange character.
Have faith in God.
Promise me you'll help them.
I wonder why Tom isn't here.
Many people thought he was too young to be president.
Tom wondered if Mary could speak French.
Our train was late.
Why is Tom looking at me?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
How's Tom when he's angry?
He's so lazy.
Help Tom study.
Do you like to travel?
Do you like Tom?
I don't want to be afraid of Tom anymore.
What keeps you up so late?
You don't have a wife, do you?
It was sudden.
Just use mine for now.
He risked his life to save her.
We can't be friends anymore.
He didn't give me anything.
Your father was right.
Tom is very generous.
You let Tom kiss you?
How old could your grandfather be?
They are too indebted to get the loan for small businesses.
Do you have oranges?
Looks like Tom's upset.
I know you've spent the last three years in prison.
That's the norm.
The office is deserted.
He sleeps a lot.
Don't keep it upside down.
We must preserve our peaceful constitution.
This is a man dressed as a woman.
Tom is impassive.
Could you call him?
You’d be surprised at what you can learn in a week.
Tom has a house with two rooms.
Don't say stupid things!
Give them the keys.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
It's already good.
I think Tom is flexible.
We'll wait for Tom in the lobby.
I made a fool of myself.
She was dangerous.
She was happy with her new dress.
Do you see this?
He has no empathy.
Is Tom busy?
He could die.
It depends too much on him.
Tom is kind to me.
It won't happen.
Tom is home, but Mary is not.
Forget about him.
You're different.
I wasn't angry.
Tom is dead.
I know you hate school.
The daughters of my deceased have joined Facebook.
Sami called Layla for her birthday.
I was very annoyed by him for being so late.
The princess is wearing a gold tiara.
You're still shocked, aren't you?
He's a little jealous.
It weighs more than eighty pounds.
You don't drive for fear of an accident.
Send him that newspaper.
A couple of red sticks broke.
The train arrived in London.
Do your colleagues like their work?
Where do you think we are?
Thirteen Americans were killed.
I was disfigured.
I have had frequent contact with foreign students.
I have a very nice girlfriend.
I don't see him anymore.
It's unpredictable.
This underwater watch is a little too expensive.
The torch does not light at the base.
Put your books away.
His days are numbered.
Tom does what he wants.
The river flooded the entire region.
You'd better fight your sleep.
It sucks.
I have to go help her.
Sami waited.
I forgot his address.
Were you in love with them?
Hey, did you hear that?
Tom went to France two months ago.
I'm pretty weak right now.
Tom couldn't control himself.
You never trust Tom.
I don't look like Tom at all.
Our work never ends.
You know Tom likes Mary.
Why was it so slow?
We have seen three wars.
The flowers are blooming.
Let's go see them.
Are you studying French?
In 1900 he left England and never returned.
Tom's saving money for college.
The city was abandoned by its inhabitants.
Tom is rich and powerful.
He can't be more than 20.

He is the fifth man in the line.
I hate watching TV.
Iran is planning to send a monkey into space.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
You didn't listen.
You convinced me.
Layla left Sami.
Are you able to beat the machine?
Tom's not my defaulter, he's just a friend.
Tom never apologized for what he did to us.
What method did you use to quit smoking?
The Morales are in the room.
We went to the beach.
I think they'll be late.
Tom is annoyed.
You shouldn't listen to me.
It doesn't change me.
You don't have to change.
Oh, look, they're kissing!
I wish he had attended the conference.
Tom was taken to the emergency room.
I have a question for you.
Tom called at two and a half.
I live in Osaka.
I'm a doctor, Jim, not a lawyer.
I'm keeping this place for you.
Tom didn't know who Mary was.
I won't find a bad one.
Today the weather is beautiful.
Nobody cared.
Are you from Urumqi?
Let me take you to the hospital.
We love what we do.
Together everything is possible!
I want you to be better.
He didn't come back.
You'd better go and help them.
He ordered him not to give orders.
I think Tom's in trouble.
I would like you to accompany him.
Have you been to Cairo?
She's got to be out.
I'm not worried about you.
What do you want to do for work?
We want to meet him.
Do you like songs?
Do you really think Tom is honest?
I'm getting married soon.
They added a woman to the committee.
Tom didn't scare me.
I'm working here.
He can't swim.
You can talk to me, you know?
Are you always busy?
Did he tell you what to do?
Don't fuck her up!
How long have you lived in Kobe?
How much do you like your new job?
Tom sailed the school.
It wasn't that cold yesterday.
I really like Tom.
Tom vomited in the bucket.
Sami doesn't celebrate Halloween.
You'll never see them again.
I tried to contact him.
He made room for an elderly woman on the bus.
What are you doing here?
It's a delicate issue.
I went to see a movie with Tom after work.
There will always be.
I'm trying to avoid them.
No one can understand it.
I'm getting weak!
You're pretty overweight, aren't you?
I never believed him.
I am no longer his angel.
Tom probably won't be shy.
He can recite poems.
She closed a door.
I don't want Tom to do it here.
I'm in Rome.
Tom gave Mary a Christmas present.
I can tell you're angry.
She passed away yesterday afternoon.
You were blindfolded?
We're getting help.
This guy tried to kill me.
We arrived in New York at night.
Why did Tom kiss Mary?
Come on, don't be silly.
It's a little late for that, don't you think?
I shouldn't have trusted her.
They all knew you.
Why did you sign the confession?
I know Tom's guilty.
You have only two options.
You seem surprised.
I'll ask around.
I don't remember anything.
Tom speaks French perfectly.
He bought bread.
Tom started working immediately.
Do you like this flower?
Do you know Mr. Jackson?
I shouldn't have stayed.
Tom's trying to fix his car.
You think Tom's still up?
Why are you giving Tom money?
It might be better.
He really hates that way of thinking.
Don't associate with them.
I speak french.
Here's an even better idea.
We're all done here.
Right now, I don't have a plan.
She calls him a lot.
She's a musicologist.
Why do you give Tom money?
The children know that too.
Mary prepared breakfast for her husband.
I wanted to talk to her about something.
We should have tried harder.
Which one is yours?
I just changed my mind.
I said I was hungry.
I haven’t read any of those books.
Lisa was fed up with the noise.
Tom was in the garden.
It's permafrost, isn't it?
Do you wear glasses?
Are you sure Tom won't be angry?
Tom's gonna call the cops.
Please fill your forehead.
Tom forgot his umbrella again.
Do you have a cell phone?
It seems to me that he is honest.
Don't turn the lights off.
They still live with their parents.
Who doesn't like that?
They used the serum of truth.
You're allowed to do that.
I didn't know what to say.
I'm feeling really good.
Give me some.
This is Tony.
He's rich, but disliked.
Read the book aloud.
I think I'll go get them.
Where did you trade them?
I asked Tom and Mary for their keys.
He said he'd call me.
He never had a screwdriver in his hand.
I managed to save them.
You think Tom's guilty?
Why would we want to punish you?
We're not disappointed.
Your handwriting is illegible.
Do you like Tom's tattoos?
Do you have any books on Armenia?
He's as busy as ever.
He called his lawyer.
Are you drunk?
Tom seemed amazed.
I'm tired of singing.
Tom won't buy a new car.
Do you love her?
Tell her we're busy.
Is Tom around?
I need to talk to him now.
I can't see them.
Nobody's gonna know.
Do you want to do business or not?
He asked for a beer.
