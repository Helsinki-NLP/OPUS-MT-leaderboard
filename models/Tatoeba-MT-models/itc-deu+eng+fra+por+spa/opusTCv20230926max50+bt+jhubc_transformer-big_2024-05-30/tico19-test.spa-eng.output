Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparedness for a wave of COVID-19 patients who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a conglomerate of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported that the causative agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we looked at trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in the province of Hubei, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were recorded in France on January 24, 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths had occurred in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), COVID-19 case counts reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources, such as the country’s Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with that of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated to 14 days; in this way, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of March 15, 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of 14-day truncated COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK in general followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased considerably around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries exhibited upward trends in the cumulative incidence of similar COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite different stages in countries, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected systematically to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios for health care capacity saturation, with calculations for each EU/EEA and UK country of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalisation cases associated with a >90% risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Since, so far, case clusters have been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional recruitment population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Statistical Territorial Unit Nomenclature 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units, therefore, need to prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as is happening in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, it is essential to take a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, given that the predicted rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented early.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and lessen pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere around the world, creating a catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on the emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope this analysis will help understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, has become an unheard of and indelible memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay home throughout the holiday and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; that’s why, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 more countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 patients deceased.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “public enemy number 1” and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific papers on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, have been published since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
The objective of this analysis is to summarize the advances in research on this fast-developing new subject.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some decisive questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, which primarily cause about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third coronavirus outbreak to be recorded in human history.
As shown in Fig. 1.1, pneumonia conglomerates of unknown origin were first reported on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was revealed.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infection from health care providers was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the source of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and nearly 50 more countries around the world (fig.
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final size and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 infected people were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expanded into conglomerates mostly in and around Hubei.
On average, 5 days (2 to 9) elapsed between the onset and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (4.8 to 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected rose exponentially before January 23, 2020, coinciding with the time of mass mobilization leading up to China’s Spring Festival.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, enveloped viruses that contain a one-way chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which the alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are the ones that infect humans.
The spike glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its cellular receptors, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusión occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA, along with envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, forms virion-containing vesicles, which are then fused with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequential samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using a transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultrathin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV receptor.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could have a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the electron cryomicroscopy structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution, in complex with the transporter amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had both open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug study in order to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The Origin and the Intermediate Guest
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate in bats and were transmitted to humans by civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to two bat SARS-like coronaviruses called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and it remains to elucidate the transmission pathway.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as bat virus carriers to humans, implying homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins (long-snouted mammals that feed on ants and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99 percent genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference propagated by the totality of two genomes remains a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
The general human population lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel coronavirus.
So far, no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been announced.
Consequently, we can only resort to previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig.
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including lectin-type C receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response adds to the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
The cooperating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system locally generates a large amount of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multiorgan failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance in conglomerates, most likely affects older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to have a higher chance of becoming infected than others.
The average estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, demonstrates that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographics of 8866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adapt the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period; in this way, asymptomatic infected people will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or by other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnoea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients and in line with the higher lethality of MERS with respect to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%) were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was required in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality for November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high and rose to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than that of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients within two weeks of onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital can contract the virus again, a warning sign that the time of quarantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/l, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase were observed in 1099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of the degradation of fibrin present in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities in the chest X-rays of most patients with COVID-19 are detected, characterized by shadows or opacities in bilateral frosted glass in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid build-up, and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst findings on chest X-rays are usually parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of the pneumocytes, the formation of a hyaline membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstice, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is coincident with the pathology of a viral infection and of ARDS, and similar to patients with ARDS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred also with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at between 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/l and 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microliter sample) using a complex instrumentation that requires less than one hour of gradation.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to inexperience with the new coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include treatments currently in use or potential with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus first.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as those of the digestive tract and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Accordingly, respiratory assistance is critical to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) assistance, a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The cytokine storm is known to result from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release an enormous amount of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and multiorgan failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 antireceptor monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm are modulation of the T-cell-directed immune response; blockade of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a cytokine signaling pathway 4 suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, specifically osteonecrosis, which affects the prognosis remarkably.
However, the prudent use of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids over a short period of time has been recommended for patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of this analysis, the efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in a U.S. patient with COVID-19 has been proven.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the compound to China for a couple of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is high expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
Drawing blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting the disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and they recognize certain molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and 10 seriously ill patients were injected.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved blood oxygen saturation.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this in order to propose the method for its use on a large scale until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, possibly leading to fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or look for effective antibodies against virus essential proteins.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects largely depend on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to the theories of MCT.
Most effective components remain unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were determined to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces of China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the province of Hubei, which used MCT in only about 30% of its COVID-19 patients (13%), had the lowest recovery rate).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (MO) treatment only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization was noticeably shorter in the MO+MCT group than in the MO alone group.
Most surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (mild to severe) was noticeably lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO alone (7.4% vs. 46.2 %) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO alone (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of MCT remains awaited by more well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more facilities.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and determine the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are usually very afraid of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people with suspicion and people who are in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission of infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent, long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated virus vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older people and models of lethal stimulation and their protection against infection by zoonotic viruses still need to be determined before a clinical trial is initiated.
This is probably because SARS went extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been recorded since.
Instead, there continue to be cases and clusters of MERS sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mostly occurred in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were most likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably larger than those who did not require them (mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor in the evolution of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are most likely to suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, an elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict patient evolution.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Thus, they are traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for the prediction of clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as an adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was widespread in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as they generally endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, as with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early phase or in the incubation period can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, while transmission mostly did not occur in the early phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will have ended by March and the downward phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical flu-like episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been managed.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually become extinct or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is given below (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the feces, posing a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were possibly caused by infections in hospitals, including 17 patients with other prior illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that could be used to decrease the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (serial number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from transmitting through the air or adhering to surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virions can fully penetrate them; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure about 85 nm.
Because the particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, health care providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (serial number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear custom-made insulation gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear protective faces or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public of affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay home in voluntary quarantine, and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered to be an adequate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused great alertness in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproducibility among humans, and that there would be no problems preventing and containing the disease.
This message remarkably eased public alarm, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing for Spring Festival, and the critical moment was wasted to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious when making public announcements, as every word matters to citizens and can cause them to change their attitude or their decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for the formal reports of doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic in its early phase; and (3) more responsive to the public.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and about 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has generated the feeling of SARS reappearance.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality are also higher in older people than young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even if they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are seriously ill, resulting in a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients may test positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain to be resolved, such as the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, it is not possible to brake the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can resurface at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while being transmitted between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, become extinct like SARS, or re-emerge periodically like the flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these questions and many others.
However, whatever it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild illnesses, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put coronaviruses in the spotlight again and surprised us with high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful for us to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses have their origin in bats, in which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications in preventing disease in humans.
Investigating the interactions between coronaviruses and hosts in animals could also yield important information about the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present an overview of existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Notably, we compared and contrasted the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of enveloped positive single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which house the largest genome, 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were called "coronavirus" because of their morphology, because of the crown shape they have under an electron microscope.
As for their structure, coronaviruses have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the polyproteins replicase pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1-16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different coronavirus lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the betacoronavirus genus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes for most alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronaviruses.
The other five betacoronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from nasal secretion from common cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude lethality of around 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a persistent epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91 000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice, or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which the viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but present great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force, and species jump restriction factors.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal hosts and SARS-CoV-2 amplifiers, which would have important implications in preventing the spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, cross-species transmission and human coronavirus pathogenesis.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that human coronavirus parental viruses are normally not pathogens in their natural reservoir hosts, but instead become pathogens following cross-species transmission to a new host.
We also examined the evolutionary trend of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also analyzed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before strain B814 of HCoV-229E was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, such as headache, sneezing, malaise, and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10–20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial pass in brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other airway pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed around the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a disease period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had a severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia,” caused the first well-documented human coronavirus pandemic in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the superpropagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and shortness of breath as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and elevated creatine kinase levels are common abnormal results in laboratory tests for SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower airways, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, can also become infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a storm of cytokines, which could be fatal, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to the research of human coronaviruses.
The HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined to be prevalent in young children, older adults, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed around the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents occurred from unknown causes, as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to have caused severe lower respiratory infection in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although the majority of laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, cases have been recorded with occasional contagion to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute kidney failure, which so far is only found with MERS among diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were recorded, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, who retrospectively were associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be a public health emergency of international importance and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a raw lethality of 3.4%.
Notably, the lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which occurs as fever, cough, and dyspnoea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between that of SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents characteristics that are most frequently observed in human coronavirus infections acquired in the community, which includes the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, there is also a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 as with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to verify whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages between humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it still needs to be elucidated in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after passage between humans, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious disease in humans and humans that developed serious human coronavirus diseases have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in humans to a degree sufficient to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
The longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people it infects, the greater the likelihood that it will fully adapt to humans.
If well adapted, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to be maintained and propagated in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to propagate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as human coronaviruses acquired in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it harbors a closely related ancestor that shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is normally well adapted and is not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host harbors a human coronavirus on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, guests become infected naturally and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parental virus.
In contrast, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or at about the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and fulfill the function of amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then be transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence research indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were recorded after killing all the civets of the markets.
However, civets from wild or farm masked palms without exposure to live animal markets were reported to be mostly SARS-CoV negative, suggesting that civets from masked palms would only act as an amplifying intermediate host, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, given that 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the chances that several species of small mammals will also act as SARS-CoV amplifier intermediate hosts cannot be ruled out.
All of them appear to be SARS-CoV terminal hosts.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called Rhinolophus bat HKU3 SARS-related (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat coronaviruses share an 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats harbor emerging pathogens in humans.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as live viruses.
The human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
The WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of bats was shown to use the ACE2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter the cells.
Surprisingly, serums from convalescent SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV phylogenetically closer to their betacoronavirus counterparts from identified bats in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies specifically, as are camels native to the Middle East in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, further supporting that camels act as bona fide reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
Also, it should be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in infected camels for MERS-CoV investigations.
Notably, infected camels propagate viruses not only by respiratory route, but also by fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus propagation of bats.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of camel contact prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to human-to-human transmission or to unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species harboring MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the future nearly identical bat coronavirus.
Presumably, intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Huanan shellfish wholesale market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), may also harbor ancestral betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this novel pangolin coronavirus share an 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (RBD) most similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigus in lung samples, which turn out to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct origin in the pangolin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-coronaviruses.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-coronaviruses.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between RBDs of pangolin beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterproposal advocates a recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-coronaviruses and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronavirus, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Mountain Coronavirus) detected in a North American tricolor bat was reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate hosts.
For clarity, knowledge so far of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of human-to-species coronavirus transmission events in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is not as accurately known.
Bat alpha-coronaviruses closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them is an alpaca alpha-coronavirus.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alpha-coronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-coronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-coronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring the HCoV-229E-related alphacoronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alpha-coronaviruses act as the gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, particularly in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by later findings.
It is evident that bats contribute, with a rich collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and great ability to fly are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal “virus propagator.”
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate host, to being a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host of SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses, as are civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities of cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody study in domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Aside from the different types of animal hosts, three major factors in viral terms also play an important role in making it easier for coronaviruses to cross species barriers.
First, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a read-check exorbionuclease, the elimination of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remdesivir is known to suppress coronavirus replication by inhibiting this exorbionuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of coronaviruses are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is hoped that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to cause SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Secondly, the long RNA genome of coronaviruses exerts additional plasticity in modifying the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the likelihood of coevolution between species, which leads to the emergence of new coronaviruses when the right conditions are met.
This is supported by copious single open reading frames and the functions of proteins encoded towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently change templates during RNA replication using a unique copy-choice mechanism.
In a host acting as a mixing vehicle, chain change frequently occurs during the transcription of coronavirus RNA.
Full-length and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the aforementioned three viral factors, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in cross-species transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated strains of human and civet SARS-CoV, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, in particular with mutations in the RBD of protein S.
In general, the RBD of the S protein of a coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its co-receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is capable of recognizing ACE2 receptors from various animals, including bat, civet, mouse, and raccoon dog, allowing cross-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, as observed, only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human and civet viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical to the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implies that the binding affinity of the S protein to human ACE2 could have been altered.
In fact, an electron cryomicroscopy study points to the 10 to 20-fold greater affinity of this binding compared to that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other co-receptors may be necessary for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, following interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the outcome of cross-species transmission of human coronaviruses is also determined by other host dependency and restriction factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses must usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for interspecies transmission to be successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important área of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
Objective full genome research of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could prove beneficial.
The emergence of new human coronaviruses: let’s start from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic pool of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes have the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered to be important in adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but were determined to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide elimination characteristic of SARS-CoV was found in isolated strains at the onset of the epidemic in humans.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lineages, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination locations in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14 were also identified.
Similarly, epidemic MERS-CoV has been shown to undergo recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses recombine with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from releasing viruses from selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to a removal of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-coronavirus has a single nucleotide insertion, causing a frame change.
Last but not least, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by selection pressure on their reservoir hosts.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Apparently, bats are well adapted to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats could suppress coronavirus replication and affect exorbionuclease reading check, which provides selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for adaptation to the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate energetically without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers exist and what causes severe cases of infection in humans lie.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from coronavirus replication.
The same strategy of delinking the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I, at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflasome in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat beta-coronavirus has been found to share a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been determined to harbor SARS-CoV-identical viruses, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-coronaviruses have been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-coronaviruses could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have regained prominence due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
Vast evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing the civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several pangolin beta-coronavirus lineages closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be elucidated in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transportation tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach to developing effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels should be taken in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks could appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There is a high chance that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on poor experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to spread presents itself.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, the opportunities for humans to contact bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to move away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful to prevent animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, it must be elucidated how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it’s a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are nearly identical are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Advice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 New Coronavirus Infection (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and constitutes a good reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the latest diagnostic criteria of “suspect case” and “confirmed case” according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO called COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guideline that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed significantly.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case it is necessary to combine any point of the epidemiological background characteristics with two points of the clinical manifestations to make an exhaustive analysis, or three points of the clinical manifestations must be fulfilled if there is no clear epidemiological background:
Epidemiological background: (1) a history of small areas of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities in which cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of Wu-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test in the city); and (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or symptoms of COVID-19 have been reported in the previous days.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in COVID-19 infection imaging; (3) total white blood cell counts showing a normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the early onset stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected phase case with some characteristic of pathogenic or serological tests as follows: (1) real-time polymerase chain reaction test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the recognized novel coronaviruses; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV; or (3) positive result for the specific IgG antibody and the specific IgG antibody against SARS-Co.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood or airway samples was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens from blood samples was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then, serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
<0x7B>NS<0x7D>
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us that we must be cautious with asymptomatic and symptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system should also be verified in other studies and clinical practices.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case", we recommend searching for and complying with the newest guidelines of your countries of origin.

Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest number in a day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in one day.
It is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
The Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were staying at their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old, and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obaidul Quader, said public transport would be suspended for longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transport of essential goods, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still allowed.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on March 8, two men returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
By March 19, these three had already recovered.
More than one million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said on Thursday it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours leading up to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that on Wednesday there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to receive their salaries without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the curfew was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended his order to stay home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their toilet paper purchase limits to two and one package per transaction at all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the one-packet limit.
These limitations were published as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers reportedly were sourcing for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were introduced following the previous four-packet per transaction restriction applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the application of the four-pack restriction, “many supermarkets still sell out the product within an hour of delivery,” and said the lawsuit was “unprecedented,” while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was “unexpected.”
Sales rose with a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a Wednesday special offer planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, chief executive of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local city council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It forecasts an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, following the early release of stocks, some supermarkets are unable to make Wednesday’s special offer.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets stock up every night.
He stressed that toilet paper is a bulky item, which causes a low amount of stock in numbers, and, when it is depleted, leaves a large empty space on the shelves, which intensifies the sense of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea that if there were an abundant amount of the item on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could be bought and there were large quantities, panic would probably be minimized, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that stocks were running out.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, said they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain supply, according to the report on News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had time off on the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside of Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of the toilet paper Andres to two packages of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, a pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” only refers to the magnitude of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO highlighted the need to urge governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
We are deeply concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "in addition to influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from onset to continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
“And we’ve never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time,” he added.
The new pandemic condition comes after the WHO’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, “in conclusion, it’s going to get worse.”
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a public health emergency of international importance on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and around 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The case-by-case lethality rate was estimated to be 4 per cent in China, while globally it ranged from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping distance from other people, and controlling and isolating yourself from people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic led to severe global socio-economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies aggravated by panic-motivated purchases.
Schools and universities closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus was disseminated online, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant cases of virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On December 31, 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and in early January 2020 an investigation was initiated.
The cases, for the most part, were related to Huanan’s seafood wholesale market, therefore, the virus was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person known to have symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last wet market group.
From the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was determined that two-thirds had a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to November 17, 2019, of a 55-year-old person from Hubei province, could have been the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly declined in China but suddenly increased within China, the first time there were new cases out of Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of cases super
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK’s lead science advisor, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would have to become infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who underwent COVID-19 testing, and who obtained a confirmed positive result according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test people who had only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection in 79% of registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the numbers of infections in Italy were considerably higher than reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time elapsed from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, most commonly 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were from people over 60, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refer to deceased people who tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The number of actual deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who died without testing may not be included, for example, in their homes, nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of COVID deaths by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is an underestimate," a claim corroborated by anecdotal reports of subcounting in the United States. This underestimate is frequent in pandemics, as in the January 2020 swine flu pandemic. The first H1N1 death occurred in 2009.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on Feb. 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on Feb. 14.
As of Feb. 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica, and various indicators are generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time elapsed since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.The proportion of deaths over cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global ratio of deaths to cases is 6.0 percent (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths on cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with onset of symptoms from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (in those with onset of symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other indicators include the case-by-case lethality rate, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died due to a disease.
These statistics do not have a specific time frame and consider a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Some scholars have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall pandemic infection lethality rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the tests on case-by-case lethality rate estimates.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said, “Infectious outbreaks, if uncontrolled, usually stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But right now, it’s almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen.”
China’s top medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said it “could end in June” if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO’s recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will remain circulating, possibly for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary “until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus, given it’s so easily transmitted, will go away completely” and “could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year.”
The virulence of the recurrence would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum production in the airways (phlegm), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people get seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent pressure or pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and bluish color on the face or lips; upon manifestation of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, presenting no clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm the infection, therefore, the researchers advised to monitor and carefully examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; most often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during close contact and through the small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to studies, when coughing without covering the mouth the droplets can move from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated when speaking.Respiratory droplets can also be produced during exhalation, even when speaking, although, usually, the virus is not transmitted through the air.
Droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and thus airborne spread.
It can also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at more advanced stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact-tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two or three others. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies by humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests conducted on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend handwashing after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have touched infected people.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the acute respiratory disease case group in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies upon contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the complete genome level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) samples.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin viruses and those of humans.
To date, the full genome comparison indicated that pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share at most 92% of the genetic material, which is not enough to show that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms, although it is ultimately confirmed through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by CT imaging.
According to a study in Wuhan comparing polymerase chain reaction with CT scanning, CT scanning is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends “not using CT scans as a screening method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or respiratory samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually done with a nasopharyngeal swab, although a throat swab can also be used. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these proved to be accurate enough for their widespread use to be approved.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features in X-ray and CT imaging of symptomatic individuals include asymmetric peripheral blunt glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of the results obtained in images of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by polymerase chain reaction has limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of CT scans of the chest with those of the polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although imaging is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect characteristics of the virus in images, both with x-rays and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent disease transmission include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste bin.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they became infected. It is recommended that health care providers who care for someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions, and use eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
Governments’ use of mobile phone location data for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been deployed or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and mouthwash gargles are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not available.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands without washing them beforehand.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (within one minute after exposure to the disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2–7.5% iodized povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in a facility, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or with a disposable coughing or sneezing handkerchief, and discard the handkerchief immediately.
It is recommended that those who might be infected wear surgical masks, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by respiratory droplets that disperse when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO issued instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene."
The WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends using non-medical masks made from fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or be in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand recommend people make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned going into public spaces without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask while in public spaces to be able to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded the use of masks by all people entering a supermarket.
Israel has requested that all residents wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured 10 million masks a day since mid-March, on April 1 demanded that passengers wear masks on intercity trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks to those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes measures for infection control designed to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping malls.
People can implement methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using forms of greeting that do not include contact, and physically distancing themselves from other people.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned the public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and compromised immune systems have a higher risk of suffering serious illnesses and complications, and the CDC recommends that they stay in their homes as much as possible socially in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak.
The use of the term "social distancing" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations to only have sex with a person you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation was recommended in the homes of those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation, and many governments have demanded or recommended the self-quarantine of entire populations in the affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to identify and isolate infected people, in addition to introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic through the reduction of the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to decrease the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks and self-quarantine; community-oriented measures aimed at physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of mass events; community commitment to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and cleaning of surfaces.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass screening assessments and localized quarantines, and issued alerts about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which slows the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but it should be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), as otherwise transmission reactivates quickly when measures are flexibilized.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory assistance may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases for use in the treatment of COVID-19 are being investigated.
The WHO also indicated that some “home and traditional remedies” can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key measure of response to the outbreak.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19-positive patients, and increasing available intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the amount of bed breathers available.
There are several theories about where the first case may have originated (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to Huanan’s seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, that it has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were observed of which Wuhan was in charge.
On Dec. 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Police admonished eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for sounding the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed the WHO.
At the beginning of January, enough cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, which contributed to the migration for the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub and a major railway crossing.
On January 20, China reported around 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that, as of January 20, 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, on-site refugee orders or confinement) and curfews. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are serving some form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to South Africa, and about 59 million people are confined to the Philippines.
As of March 26, 1,700 million people around the world were in some form of confinement, which increased to 2,600 million people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on November 17.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and her hospital reported to Wuhan’s Jianghan CDC on December 27.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019, indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public memo.
The WHO was informed the same day.
While these notifications were being made, police warned doctors in Wuhan of "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed there was no “clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping as a “people’s war” to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as “the largest quarantine in human history,” a sanitary cordon was announced on Jan. 23 banning travel in and out of Wuhan, extending to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was banned.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted another 14 facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.On January 26, the Government implemented more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, which included issuing health statements for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions implemented several measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Control of public movement was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor outlets. After the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, mainland China had only transmitted one case nationally in the previous five days, this time through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of nationally transmitted cases was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, two months after the imposition of confinement, were eased.On March 26, 2020, China’s Foreign Ministry announced that entry of visa holders or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details of when this policy will end.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged companies and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for the firms. The State Council declared a day of mourning that will begin with a three-minute national moment of silence on April 4 at 10:00 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to avoid re-enacting their respects online to meet the physical distance.
On January 20, 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country’s health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the church’s 9,336 followers, 1261 or approximately 13% reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, increasing to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
South Korea introduced what was considered the world’s largest and best-organized program for testing the virus in the population and isolating infected people, as well as identifying and quarantining those who were in contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newcomers from other countries through a mobile app, drive-through centers to test for the virus with results available the next day, and increased diagnostic capacity to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities.South Korean society was initially polarized regarding President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions demanding Moon’s impeachment for what they saw as mishandling of the outbreak by the government, or to praise his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest day-to-day total of cases in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, from 1 April, all newcomers from abroad will have to remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
On February 19, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that same day.
Early measures announced by the government included cancelling concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and closing universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
The Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a center for the spread of the virus after China.
Amid allegations of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had tracked their cases to Iran by Feb. 28, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, and on March 3, 23 of its 290 members reported that they had tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to also temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It indicated that there is an increased risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centers, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in the same day, the highest number on record in the country since the outbreak began.
As of March 17, at least 12 Iranian ex-politicians or politicians in office had died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times as many cases in Iran as reported.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran could be affecting the country’s financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded relief from economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new law decree to contain the outbreak, which included quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “You will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities across the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths from the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, and the majority of those cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that Italy’s combination of a large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high lethality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any social distancing measures or mass quarantine on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public.On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he advised against social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced the closure of all leisure establishments as soon as possible, such as bars and gyms, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers’ wages up to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On March 23, the prime minister announced stricter social distancing measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two people from being open air and restricted those necessary to travel and activities.
Unlike the above measures, the police could demand compliance with these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersal of meetings.
Most companies were ordered to close, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Government’s leading public health institute, announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start on testing, which concealed the true magnitude of the outbreak at the time.
Testing was tarnished by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the federal government’s lack of approval of non-governmental test kits (from academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test until early March (after a medical order was required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been performed.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many people who have symptoms and a medical order have waited hours or days for a test."

On March 25, the governor said social distancing appeared to be working, as estimates of the doubling of cases went from 2 days to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people had died from the virus. On March 26, it was reported that the United States had more confirmed coronavirus infections than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States and 12,841 people had died.

The general approval of Trump’s handling of the crisis has been polarized between partisan lines.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized the U.S.'s reliance on imports of critical materials, including special medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of travel patterns was used to identify and predict patterns of spread and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on 2018 International Air Transport Association information, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the highest number of travelers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for people traveling from Wuhan.
Bali was reportedly the least capable city among the 20 most popular destination cities from the standpoint of preparedness, while Australia’s cities were considered the most capable. On February 7, Australia released its New Coronavirus (COVID-19) Emergency Response Plan.
It announced that much more was yet to be discovered about COVID-19, and that Australia would emphasize border control and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.
Due to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights from the country of origin, with authorization from the authorities of China.

On 21 February, he landed in Trenton, Ontario, a plane carrying 129 passengers who had been evacuated from the Diamond Princess.
In early March, the Government of India began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways aircraft chartered by the Government of South Africa repatriated 112 South African citizens.
Medical tests were done before takeoff, and four South Africans who had signs of coronavirus had to stay to mitigate the risk.
Only South Africans who tested negative were repatriated.
The results of the test authorized all South Africans, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers who participated in the humanitarian mission, who, as a preventive measure, remained under observation and quarantine for a period of 14 days at The Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the United States began partially withdrawing its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, China’s Foreign Ministry said 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students at U.S. universities teamed up to help send aid to the virus-affected regions of China, and a joint group in the Chicago metropolitan area reportedly managed to send 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei province on Jan. 30. The humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, in coordination with FedEx Hospital, on Jan. 30 sent 200,000 bata masks, as well as other protection equipment.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to WHO to fund efforts to find a vaccine and treatment, in addition to protecting “at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia.”

Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million masks and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for distribution by the African Union.
He then sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 masks and 5 respirators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada, with the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressing concerns about masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain removed 58,000 coronavirus test kits made in China with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands removed 600,000 defective Chinese masks.
Belgium removed 100,000 unusable masks, which were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China’s aid was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank initiated emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in controlling and containing the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government “has provided periodic updates to avoid panic over the Lunar New Year holidays.”
On January 23, 2009, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that while "it was definitely not a recommendation made by the WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and said that "there was no precedent in the history of public health" in China.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the SPII was "due to the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without sound health systems."
In response to the implementation of the travel restrictions, Tedros stated that “there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement.”
On February 5, WHO appealed to the global community for a $675 million contribution to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries “who do not have systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, if any.”
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future". On 11 February, the WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
The same day, Tedros claimed that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to contribute the “power of the entire UN system in the response.”
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which enabled the coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on the health response while other agencies can contribute their expertise to address the wider social, economic and development consequences of the outbreak".
On February 14, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated with China to provide international and WHO field experts in China to assist in national management and assessing "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at the national level and to conduct site visits to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and county level".[25]
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergencies program, warned in a statement that “This is a verification of reality for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and we must be prepared,” insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan also said the current data did not guarantee that public health officials would declare a global pandemic, noting that such a declaration would mean that “we are basically accepting that all humans on the planet will be exposed to that virus.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said the WHO was "very concerned, both by alarming levels of spread and severity, and by alarming levels of inaction." The WHO has received major criticism for what is considered inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed that the rights of all people should be respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that all people have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, in addition to views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo Bolsonaro for his handling of the pandemic, which began in China’s Hubei province.
Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) were fired due to their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political system’s response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe the move was taken to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, dismissed an earlier recognition of the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the U.S. or Italy.
The U.S. Trump administration has referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus,” and claimed that “China’s censorship overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and “distraction from its administration’s failure to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. Government describing a communications ploy with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and citing the strategy as "All About China."
We have been told to try to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union’s foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that “there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, U.S. sanctions blocked Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
U.S. authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries to their own country.
And there have been reported disputes related to masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said: "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" claiming that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio dismissed the journalistic reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a medically assisted cargo plane to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment gain momentum, they will also be able to respond if necessary.”
NATO’s planned military exercise “Defender 2020” in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO’s largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted on a reduced scale.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries involved, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government was very affected by the virus.
On March 14, 2020, Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, saying that his country is having a hard time fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak pushed the demand that the United States adopt greater common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universally paid child health care, family leave.
Political analysts anticipated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan’s “ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts” after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized about Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions demanding Moon’s impeachment for what they saw as government mismanagement of the outbreak, or to praise his response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections and sanction those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the handling of the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed on several cases of supply shortages, as a result of increased global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven procurement and disruptions to logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven shopping that left the shelves empty of essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, leading to shortages of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in shipments of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment increased 100-fold.
This demand generated a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical items.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and WHO warned that this would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas was affected by acute food shortages.
China and Italy’s measures against the accumulation and illicit trade of essential products have been successful, and prevented an acute food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its significant agricultural production, has not seen a considerable reduction, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released pork stockpiles to ensure sufficient food for the population.
In Italy there are similar laws that require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
Damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a March 16 news report, China’s economy was badly hit in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been seen as a threat of considerable destabilization to the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist’s Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges about the potential consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could outweigh those of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the world’s supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was reportedly “revolted” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On Feb. 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indexes, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their steepest drops since 2008, the Dow fell 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with declines of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again on the basis of fears about the coronavirus, with the biggest fall occurring on March 16.
Many believe that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, an important travel season related to the Chinese New Year holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year’s festivals, while private companies also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events and tourist attractions of the Lunar New Year have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in opening hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50-60% drop.
This also led to a 33% to 43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping malls around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to monitor buyers’ temperatures and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been left in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were stranded in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government help.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. Confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving daily wages) unemployed. According to the survey from the Angus Reid Institute in March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Almost half a million companies in Germany have implemented government-subsidized short-term work schemes, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German scheme of short-term labour compensation has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which impacted the operations of organizations and individuals, both employed and self-employed, around the world.
Cultural and arts sector organizations sought to fulfill their mission (often funded by public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and increasing consequence at an accelerated rate of the disease is the cancellation of major religious services. sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of Lent’s Christian penance season.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches have offered religious services via radio, live streaming over the Internet or television, while others offer spaces for prayer from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter’s Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran’s health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their residents from entering the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will be “rescheduled for a date after 2020 but not after the summer of 2021.” Casinos and other gambling venues around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to turn to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as those on Broadway, also suspended all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live show, such as live broadcasts of concerts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to perform, distribute or publish their work.
Numerous Internet memes about the coronavirus have been disseminated online, as many resort to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people in areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in various groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered fair retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiments.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on and off the Internet.
Following the advance of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, could also be the subject of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to achieve a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the UK and the US, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term that many critics considered racist and anti-American.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China, studying in major Indian cities reportedly suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The chairman of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that’s why God took revenge on them.”
China's consulate in Calcutta later condemned the comments and said they were "wrong." In China, xenophobia and racism toward non-Chinese residents increased as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and destined for "waste."
Many newspapers with paywalls removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on prepress servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in the samples is confirmed by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, an accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests performed across countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect reported case lethality rates, which are likely to be greatly overestimated in some countries.
Through the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be done on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours up to 2 days.
The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test performed with pharyngeal swabs is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people who are tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by suction catheter, or the material that is ejected by coughing (sputum) can be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis for the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On January 28, 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical-grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Looks for the "E" gene shared by all betacoronaviruses and the new RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China International of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the ReCoV-specific RdRp gene is now available.
One in three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kits generated inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and a jam in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples per day were satisfactorily processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of tests using two components was not determined until February 28, 2020, and only thereafter were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of COVID-19 testing based on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, on March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics made testing for COVID-19 available nationwide.
No quantity limits were announced; specimen collection and processing must be conducted in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for the Surveillance of Medical Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform a period of approximately 4128 tests.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received emergency use authorization from the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day.In Taiwan, a test is being developed using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, in the hope that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes just like a rapid flu test.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that “thorax X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] results can be obtained even before the onset of symptoms.”
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar opacities in unglazed glass with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, cobblestone pattern, and consolidation develops.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared with CT, CT is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use CT scan as a screening method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." As of March 2020, the CDC recommends polymerase chain reaction as an initial examination.
Part of the immune system's reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population surveillance.Analysis can be performed in central laboratories or by point-of-care testing.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratory analyses, a single peripheral blood specimen is usually used, although serial specimens can be used to track the immune response.
For point-of-care tests, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by a puncture on the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, an extraction step is not needed prior to analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and, therefore, can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval from Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capability is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspicious patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a tube for specimen", the patient spits into the tube, sends it and gets a result in a short time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspect cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if they go to the hospital or the need for them.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest and most extensive tests of any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient setting and that 10,700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-through testing was being offered in several large cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, because only positive results were reported.
A first survey of laboratories revealed that, by the calendar week of 12/2020, more than 2000 samples had been analyzed in total than 10 samples, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for analyzing samples from 64 patients.
With the construction, which was overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, and took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost to face the quarantine would have doubled without this capacity for testing.
After the Wuhan laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of March 4, 2020, total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed designs provided by origami analyses were implemented that allow up to 1122 patient samples to be evaluated for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid handling robots.
For March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols involving heating samples to 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.On March 31, it was announced that the UAE was now doing more coronavirus screening per person in its population than any other country, and was on track to raise the level of testing to cover most of the population.
This was achieved by combining drive-through capability and purchasing a mass production laboratory at the population level of Group 42 and BGI (which relied on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude to operate outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for making kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, which delayed testing available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough test kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that South Korea’s high availability of tests helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The South Korean Government achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private-sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the advancement of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in delays of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents were depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained imprecise results.
The company explained that incorrect results could be due to incorrect collection of samples or incorrect use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would remove kits that gave incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara, of the Turkish Health Ministry, said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a “high error rate” and did not “put them into use”. The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but, in early April 2020, announced that they did not serve.
Testing, supplemented by quarantining those who had positive results and identifying people who had been in contact who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the place where the first death from COVID-19 occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests on the entire population of about 3400 inhabitants, about ten days apart.
Approximately half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but which did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28 Singapore began recommending residents to stay in their homes, but schools reopened in time after the March 23 holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have done more testing, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower case lethality rates, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who have only mild symptoms or who have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as % of tests" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only people who enter hospitals will have a higher number of positive tests as % than a country that tests all citizens, whether they manifest symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral route.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child’s tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, your hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After you blow your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal food or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before administering medications or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to remove from the hands pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in handwashing practices can lead to small improvements in height growth in children under five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behavior, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, as automatic behavior adopted in households, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of mortality in children under five, and it claims the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing nearly half deaths from diarrhea and a quarter deaths from acute respiratory infections.
Handwashing is typically integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that its frequent performance can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and scaly skin known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (peeing, defecating), after cleaning a child’s tail (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other occasions when a correct handwashing technique should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or blowing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of handwashing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced handwashing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%; the United States was close to half with 77%; and China had the lowest rate at handswashing at 23%.
The “Essential Health Care Program” implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of tailor-made action to promote children’s health and education.
Deworming twice a year, in addition to washing your hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is improved by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective in cleaning the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, do not easily dissolve in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in the above uses.
Some studies analyzing the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
Still, the CDC states that “liquid soap with dispensing controls that do not involve using hands is preferable.”
Antibacterial soaps have been intensively promoted for a health-conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that using recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserve antibiotic-resistant organisms by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
Thus, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, the sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the common jabacteria prevents as well as triacterians for the University of Oregon.
Pleasant hot water to wash your hands is not enough to eliminate bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at removing natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, hand hygiene agents without water and with rubbing alcohol (also known as rubbing alcohol-based hand solution, antiseptic hand solution for rubbing or hand disinfectants) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the dryness effect of the alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively remove germs.
Alcohol-based rubbing disinfectants remove bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and ERV), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based rubbing disinfectants containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (3.5 logarithm reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and from 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction from 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are virtually ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Enough antiseptic or alcohol-based hand solution should be used to rub, moisten or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dried.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing before hand rubbing disinfectants, especially when your hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid microorganism removal activity; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can dry out the skin, unless emollients or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused considerably less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based hand solutions for rubbing are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis was attractive compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as water and soap at preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens continue to remain in your hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers largely depends on the ingredients and the formula, in addition, historically, has been much less than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions for rubbing.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have been found to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ash or dirt.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that, if the soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water apparently makes no difference.
Rub your hands to foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people often wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer periods removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Rinse in a container can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or allow to air dry.
Wet and wet hands become contaminated again more easily. The parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Various economic options can be used to facilitate hand washing when there is no running water or soap available, for example, pouring water from a hanging can or pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries.In situations where there is a limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home taps and other" options.
A home tap is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jug of a rope and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over your hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about how to dry most effectively in public toilets.
More and more research is pointing out that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels offered by the most modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was detected that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, by 194% in the fingertips and 254% in the palms.
Drying with the air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total amount of bacteria of 42% in the fingertips and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms.Scientists also tested for the possibility of cross-contamination of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at alleged speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow microorganisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms.In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes in bacteria count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel, when you do not have water or soap.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of disease in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff members to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
Doctors wash their hands for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of soap or gel to foam and scrub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed together by intertwining the fingers.
If there are remains under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit doors if necessary).
This prevents the hands from becoming contaminated again by those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, lack of handwashing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses routinely forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a paper demonstrating standard hand washing and hand rubbing in the healthcare sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization’s hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website for the public to comment on.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has “Five Moments” for Handwashing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals in the soap ( "medicinal" or "antibacterial" soaps) confers the possibility of elimination to the handwashing agent.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing.
All the jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, forearm water should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical gown is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after caring for sick people.
To control staph infections in hospitals, it has been proven that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
When comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution to handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that rubbing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile hand spores than alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centers may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizer and oral reminders.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an economical and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or handwashing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it challenging to achieve universal handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few handwashing faucets near public or private toilets, although there are economical options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates can also be the result of entrenched habits and not a lack of soap or water.
The promotion of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and provoke long-term behavioral change in the population.
For this to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, community-based approaches were found to be effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF’s “Three Star” approach, which encourages schools to take simple, cost-effective steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of the handwashing promotion campaigns that are being carried out to reduce disease and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that seeks to achieve behavior change. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF spurred the creation of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting handwashing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of the disease".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne diseases and health care-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have made many countries more aware of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, signs with “correct hand washing techniques” were hung next to the toilets of public toilets and toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “wash your hands” is a statement of not wanting to take charge of something or sharing the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the biblical passage from Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands at the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a much broader phrase in use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse an imaginary stain, which represents her guilty conscience over the crimes she had committed and had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value handwashing items more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory “cleaning” actions, such as volunteering.
The religions recommend handwashing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, with water, but without soap, is part of ritual handwashing in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevilah and Yadayim netilat in Judaism. The particular handwashing in Christianity and the wudu in Islam also recommends certain.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force people to wash their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam force people to wash their hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls in the workplace in the face of COVID-19
The workplace risk controls against COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational safety and hygiene methodologies in the risk controls for the prevention of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and work task and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of workers who may be prone to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower risk of exposure have minimal work contact with the public and co-workers, for whom basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand washing, recommending workers stay home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene rules, and maintaining a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Jobs with average exposure risk include those where frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who could be infected by current community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with a high concentration of people, and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and personal protective equipment available in case there is a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that workers in health care and funeral services, exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate for the work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work because of illness, needing to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are demanded and the means of acquiring those goods (such as buying at non-peak times, through home delivery services or by car window).
Finally, shipments of items from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address levels of risk related to various workplaces and occupational activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments, and risk factors of individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address those risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to an outbreak include reducing transmission between staff members, protecting those at higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used occupational safety and hygiene framework for classifying risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative ones and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected according to the hazard to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. respirators), used appropriately and systematically, frequently inspected, maintained, replaced if necessary, and disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly so as not to contaminate.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower risk of exposure have minimal work contact with the public and co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures that are recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent handwashing, recommending workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene rules that include covering themselves when coughing and sneezing, providing tissues and containers for maintenance of waste, preparing workers for teleworking and staggering shifts if necessary, and using tools for work.
Immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a key measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they stop having fever, signs of fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or decrease fever; that employees’ sick leave policies be flexible and allow family members to take care of them.
According to OSHA, jobs with average exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact less than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but could have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
These include a range of workers who are likely to be in contact with the general public, such as in schools, workplaces with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments. The range of employees who are likely to be in contact with the general public includes the range of employees who are likely to be in contact with the general public. The range of employees who are likely to be in contact with the general public includes the range of employees who are likely to be in contact with the general public.
Workers in this risk group should rarely wear respirators.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to touch body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruise ships and other vessels carrying passengers, risk controls include postponing travel due to illness, self-isolation, and immediately reporting to the onboard medical center if anyone experiences fever or other symptoms while on board.
In the case of schools and childcare centers, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass gatherings, such as physical education or choir classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between desks, staggering incoming and outgoing times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, it may be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For law enforcement personnel conducting routine daily activities, the CDC considers the immediate risk to health to be low.
Police officers are advised to contact people who have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during an arrest, workers should clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with a household spray or cleaning wipes before re-using them and follow the standard operating procedure for containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and morgue workers to be in categories of high or very high risk of exposure.
Among the jobs at high risk of exposure are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses.
These become very high-risk jobs if workers perform aerosol generation procedures on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses or if they take or manipulate samples from these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morgue jobs include those in which workers are involved in preparing the corpses of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected of having it at the time of death; these come to have a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for those risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 procedures are performed, even when COVID-19 generation is being performed.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated in different waiting rooms depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been contagious or are suspected of having been contagious of SA-2.
In the United States, N95 respirators with NIOSH-approved or higher filter masks must be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory program that includes fit tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
The WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for incoming patient classification personnel.
For those who take respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, provide care for them or transport them without performing aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, goggles or face shields, gowns and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Because the supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the permission to enter the room of a patient with COVID-19 only to those people involved in their direct care, the use of the same mask without removing it while providing care to several patients with the same diagnosis.

This month, we find ourselves in unique circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that make up the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we’ve seen among all our peers in emails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we’re lucky enough to work with are.
I couldn’t feel more gratitude and pride that all of you are my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation he felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Their work makes this possible, whether it’s keeping sites running, helping our peers get paid, or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to talk about our approach and our schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work at a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place nowadays, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, shop or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you are sick, do not work.
Although it shouldn’t be necessary to say it, we do.
There is no need to apply for sick leave or paid time off; just inform your manager and help your team review schedules and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, let Bryan of T&C Operations know so T&C can help with support and make sure management is aware of your situation.)
People who work per hour will receive full pay.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and fellow staff working by the hour.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially these days.
Again, it’s about your personal care.
What we ask is that you contact your manager so that we know what to expect and we can adapt properly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resource Operations, Trust and Security, and Fundraising teams, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current goals and modify our approach to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don’t plan to “double the hours to catch up” when the pandemic ends.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to set new targets and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, self-care and care for loved ones while adapting to the needs of those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule over the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning burdens and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and communicate the next steps to delegates and teams as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
State, exposure and cleanliness of the office
Last week we learned that one of our San Francisco office colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty of care protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members at the DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our New York City colleagues already know, we’ve also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have already worked remotely before know that this modality requires adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limit the length of meetings to intervals of one or two hours at most.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to section them over the course of several days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and submit the reading materials in advance.
Adopt video use by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person to control the questions in the chat and speaker list, and someone to help take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the wellness refund for snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoteties channel on Slack to talk to your peers about distributed work
The HR Operations team is analyzing webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as edits, until the WHO declares an end to the pandemic.
We inform you that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible for you to fulfill your part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
Next week we will follow up with additional guidelines at Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The overall feeling of the community globally seems to be partly saddened by the disruption and partly relieved by the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
From now on, CRT will be working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keeping in touch on COVID-19 issues
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 h, Coordinated Universal Time/7:00 h, Pacific Time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help in the way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email and all of the additional essential information related to COVID-19 in the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are currently heavily affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, any coverage issues or anything you may need help with, feel free to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive matters, please send an email message to Bryan Judan, Director of Global International Operations at HR.
None of these changes should be considered an abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are an acknowledgment that, at this time, our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in a way that had not happened before.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support, and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will remain there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and, possibly, in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of yourselves and your families so that they can be in the best possible condition when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
The human version of the enzyme is generally referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a renal C-terminal amino acid transporter domain of colectrin.
ECA2 is a type I unipase membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is attached primarily to the cell membrane of the type II alveolar cells of the lungs, small intestine enterocytes, venous arterial and endothelial cells, and smooth muscle arterial cells of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to counteract ACE.
ACE cleaves the angiotensin I hormone and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 cleaves the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-O-His-His).
ECA2 can also cleave several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinophine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 S1 spike protein to the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes found within the cells.
This input process also requires the preparation of the protein S by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a possible therapy.This has led to certain hypotheses that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help fight infection.
However, various professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing standard ACE and ABR inhibitory therapy.
A systematic meta-analysis review published on July 11, 2012 determined that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not as solid for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (SARS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. The infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications designed to help with contact tracking in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who might have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government backing in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Concerns regarding privacy have been raised, in particular in relation to systems that rely on tracking the geographic location of app users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be ceded to the government. In North Macedonia “StopKorona!” was launched, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and that it would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. It is planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether app and Singapore’s BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimeter application for patients living in Moscow and having received a COVID-19 diagnosis, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, outlined several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if application adoption is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of deceptive or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store to “official” or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related objectives;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of this protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined by law;
protections against abuse should be implemented and citizens’ rights established to respond to such abuse;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) of Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from their operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present potential significant privacy issues.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see the following section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate alerts via text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, have considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been published.
Privacy-protected contact tracking is a well-established concept, with a wealth of published research going back at least to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCNs, formerly known as contact event numbers, CENs) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking among privacy protection (ACTs), other protocols for the protection of privacy.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device and all pairing occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab’s Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location data or route intersections to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical report “Applications Out of Control: How to Maintain Personal Privacy During an Epidemic,” published in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly matched protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect to achieve broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative that they said would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, it is intended to implement the system in three stages:
Implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address adoption and persistent surveillance issues by distributing the system first through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
Reprofiling (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of those binding sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA-directed RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ribophosphatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that they then optimized and analyzed to identify their backbone similarity to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an urgent use authorization (U.S.).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trials process and is authorized under a U.S.A. only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when “there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, large studies are underway.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half was given umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would turn to the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticism has emerged about the allocation of resources to the readaptation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international trial Solidarity.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in more serious disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two run by Cleveland University hospitals; one for people with a moderate disease and one for those with a more serious disease.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are ongoing for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began trials of the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin’s Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is underway and 200 severe patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in decreasing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults ages 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding or who do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On April 14, a multicenter study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are devoting much attention to the re-adaptation of antiviral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SRAG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
<0x7B>NS<0x7D>
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine.
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, to be available in less than 18 months.
As of April, five possible vaccines were in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale-up and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Among the targets of the main platforms that have moved on to Phase I safety studies are the following:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, in total, 115 possible vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (assumed to be planned or developed).
A phase I or II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and is performed at several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while controlling adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active-developing vaccines (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet under evaluation in humans (they were still in the “preclinical” research).
Around Jan. 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly clamped vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan’s International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human testing to begin in 2021.
Projects for vaccine development were announced at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotech partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for vaccine development.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper with a design for a vaccine with technology similar to that used in the treatment of neoantigenic cancer vaccines.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and that they were starting tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested on humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, although it is moving fast, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The potential vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine,” against which the German government complained.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The possible BNT162 mRNA-based vaccine is currently under preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human testing of the possible final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI’s total investment of USD 29 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.
CEPI’s other partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun animal testing of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced CAD 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, including a host of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago’s initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a “national vaccine bank” with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced the testing of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice and said that "SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines administered by MNA obtained potent responses from antigen-specific antibodies (in mice) that were evident two weeks after the vaccine was given."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within human bacteria and produce virus-like harmless particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressing ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlights the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
SARS and SROM vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. Nor is there a confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When SROM became widespread, it was believed that existing research on SARS could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments for MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one SROM (DNA-based) vaccine completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were ongoing, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19-causing virus was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiorgan insufficiency.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets occur when exhaling, they usually fall to the floor or on surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease.The standard method for diagnosis is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that you do not use them, others recommend that you do use them, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking, and bluish face or lips. If these symptoms occur, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
It is less common to see symptoms in the upper airways, such as sneezing, runny nose, and sore throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multiorgan insufficiency, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5 percent of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Korea (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78 per cent) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking aloud releases more droplets than when speaking at a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth when coughing can cause droplets to travel 15 feet (4.5 meters).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside people’s bedrooms tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, airborne transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spreading through the stool, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread is possible before symptoms begin, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, a person usually infects two or three more. The virus survives for hours or days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way.Soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and deactivate it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of testing.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in coronaviruses of a related nature.
Outside the human body, household soap kills the virus as it bursts its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cells via the type 2 angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE2), which abounds most in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spice" (peplomer) to connect with ACE2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may be related to receptor ACE2 in the heart.
The ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a poor prognosis. Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 detected diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for epithelial cells expressing airway ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were observed to correlate with IL-6-secreting monocyte recruitment and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
In autopsies, lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported.
The WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on airway samples obtained from a nasopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swab or sputum samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken two weeks apart and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether the person was infected in the past) were developing, but were not widely used.
The experience in China with the tests has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 for use later that month.Diagnosis guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular frosted glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, pattern in disordered cobblestone (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsies are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
There are four types of viral pneumonia severity:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with infiltration of lymphocytes and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in cure: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leucoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to decrease the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing your hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth without washing your hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, and if you don’t have handkerchiefs, use the inside of your elbow.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth lids in public places, one of the reasons being to limit transmission by asymptomatic people.Social distancing strategies seek to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling crowded public meetings.
Distance guidelines also indicate that people should maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective drug to prevent COVID-19. Since there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, at the earliest, a key part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as “flattening the curve.”
The CDC also recommends washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when your hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after your nose sounds, coughs, or sneezes.
They also recommend using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available in a timely manner.For areas where hand sanitizers are not easy to get, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for antisepsis of the hands."
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
Patients are provided with supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy, and treatment for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments can be helpful for those who have mild symptoms in the early stage of infection.The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pneumologists in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of several agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend parecetamol (acetaminophen), rather than ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends that health care professionals who care for people with COVID-19 place the patient in an airborne infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and precautions to prevent airborne transmission. The CDC highlights guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is PPE gown, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, respirators (rather than masks) are preferred.
N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized their use by means of an Urgent Use Authorization (U.S.A.).
They are designed to protect against particles that are in the air, such as dust, but effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not stipulated in the product indications is not guaranteed.
When no face masks are available, the CDC recommends the use of protective face masks or, as a last resort, homemade face masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not serious enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is actively being studied for people hospitalized with COVIDA-19-related respiratory failure and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure in the airways.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provides the same benefit to people in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases occur mainly in older adults (over 60 years old and, in particular, over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, limiting the ability of the health system to handle the sudden increase in severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a COVID-19 patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Respirators that have different modes of pressure control and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply, while minimizing the risk of respirator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research into possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of the new drugs may delay until 2021, several drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medications can be tested on people with severe disease.
The WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of possible treatments.The FDA has granted a temporary authorization to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person’s life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect “close contact” and therefore a potential risk of infection by monitoring data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-containment, but also alerts local health officials. Big data analysis of mobile phone information, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they were in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track data on the mobile phones of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summarized location data of the phones with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breaches.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile operators have informed him that "however, 40 percent of people continue to travel."
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel anxious about quarantine, travel restrictions and side effects of treatment or fear the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may follow a mild course with few or no symptoms, so it will resemble other upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at risk for serious infection with the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and SROM, but data from COVID-19 is insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In more severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to water respiratory distress syndrome (WHRS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, impaired coagulation, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Disruption of coagulation, specifically increased protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19; while impairment of renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30 percent of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In an incipient case study, the average time from the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a complete interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among men was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China’s National Health Commission, heart damage resulted from elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
Insufficient counting of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospitals Authority found a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ damage.
This can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been reported that subsequently tested positive for coronavirus.
These cases are thought to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, by means of an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as of December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, as well as being affected by the volume of evidence, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and general health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned emergency disease codes ICD-10 U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lethality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given time interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global lethality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the rate of lethality in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and the rate of lethality in infected people, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these can provide information about how many people became infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the youngest, so there was relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all COVID-19 deaths have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined from blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is highest among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for males is for those in their 50s, and the gap between males and females narrows only at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in males and 1.7 in females.
The exact reasons for this difference by sex are not known, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological differences based on sex, the lower number of women who smoke, and the fact that men have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age may have contributed to the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57 % of those infected were male and 72 % of those killed by COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track information about sex in COVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nurses, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to corona, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations under the name to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
It is common for "coronavirus" to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common for the virus and disease to be referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and water respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, or chickens.
There are no drugs or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the “Solidarity Trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising existing antiviral compounds in terms of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing potential vaccines.
The above work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use receptor ECA2 to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a novel infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the protein S that helps the virus get into the receptor ECA2.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Readapted antiviral drugs make up the bulk of Chinese research, including nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries and are due to report by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and potential COVID-19 drugs was underway. Several antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence on the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the U.S., China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for the research.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that double that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an urgent use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
It has been recommended that further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide be conducted, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial priming of the S protein that performs transmembrane serine protease type 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with receptor ECA2.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines.The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in treatment guidelines after completion of a small study.
It is found in a non-randomized national phase II trial in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, counteract such effects, which are believed to be the cause of death for some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine-releasing syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
To date, there is no non-randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people in need is being investigated as a method of passive immunization without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with the SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
