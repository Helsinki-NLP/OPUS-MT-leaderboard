The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop
The new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD councillors in the capital are going to have to overcome, it seems, the obvious language barriers in order for the members of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed SDG partners.
The Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz period "examined" the members of the new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Council to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The codified dictionary that used the political flower and cream of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors almost do not understand these well-known concepts.
At least, they say.
“Who is Voldemort?”
"The truth is, I don't know."
"Rather, I'm a novice in Prague politics," said Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the culture councillor, during the terminology examination for "colleague".
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted the same way.
You may be familiar with the concept of a golf hole.
“It’s probably the only expression of all the ones you asked me to use from time to time.”
"If not, I don't normally use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions the newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz published last June ahead of the SDG voting congress, the editorial staff chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
Socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "going to the pastry shop", "bull's neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "blinding".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, refused directly to do so.
“I don’t get into these things and I don’t think about valuing how civic Democrats have fun.”
"What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, supposedly Councilman Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> would not have realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
To Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> the word "Voldemort" says nothing; the only term he got in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, who immediately adds: "But rather I know it from the news."
“I’m going to have to sign up for a language course,” he jokes.
Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Environment Councilor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Afterwards, both social democrats know who Voldemort really is and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it is soon revealed to Plach<0xC3><0xBD> that it is the headquarters of the Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek companies.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among social democrats there is no glossary so familiar of colloquial terms.
“I asked my teammates, but it really seems like we don’t have anything like it.”
"Rather, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or make puns with the names," says the president of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Petr Hulinsk<0xC3><0xBD>, whose partymates call Hulda.
"I was called B<0xC5><0x99>íza at school, but I don't know if my classmates call me that too," confesses her own nickname Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tested the name and it works.
For his partymates, Weinert is D<0xC4><0x9B>da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they partnered before the election deceptions during the party's sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" ("playmobil") from some of his teammates.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that social democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of batting rights" apparently recalls Petr Hulinsk<0xC3><0xBD> having obtained his doctorate in law from the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as published in a brochure
Women considered as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually old, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "become" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
“Men seldom suffer such a thing.”
“Healthy young women are also not isolated, because they help in the work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of the state of West Africa, Burkina Faso takes care of a special residence of more than 100 women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual “social measure”.
It issued an information leaflet that should help prevent witch hunting.
However, this has a catch.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” warns the newspaper Die Standard about the disadvantages of writing awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was caught in the oil that is used for ritual anointings.
It caught fire when the group wanted to "expel the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: “The devourers of human souls have always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease witch hunting, in Gambia last year the president still participated.
Gambian President Jammeh, following the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging hunt for witches who had allegedly been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself through black magic.
“To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, forcibly took randomly chosen men and women from Gambian villages to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a pound of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the detainees did not survive their stay on the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detainees.
Bakala tenant: heats up with coal stoves and signs higher rent
The man, elderly and stout, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnate" Zde<0xC5><0x88>ek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he was carrying documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his own, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is serving sentence.
All three have just been caught in rent liberalization.
Instead of 3,500 CZK per month, the son will pay 4,100 CZK from next year onwards for a two-room apartment with a separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in the new contract of his son, over whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, in the face of this, man only makes a move.
“Everyone says a thing,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major test laboratory for liberalization.
After New Year it will happen with the vast majority of flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, by Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to pick up number.
"Rental 2011", can be read on a light button of your touch screen.
When you press it, a small piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
There is almost no time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Soon after, an elderly couple arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rents.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for repairs, insurance issues, and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 flats belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
"It's been working for a week, so it's starting," respond, after briefly hesitating, the workers who are in it when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and former Bakala miner’s flats are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, the vice-president of the Parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek, from Ostrava, from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, already addressed them loud and clear, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change my goddamn bathroom plate," the man mentioned in the introduction says.
According to the workers, for the moment, retirees come more than anything to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as the special offer of RPG promises.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half of the February rental discount.
However, the window of mining “liberalization” certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
“Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked about the rent in 2011,” estimates the window clerk.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rent, an independent judge must settle the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible way to proceed and completely in accordance with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
“Nobody’s going to be judged here,” says one of the RPG Byty employees, and a man on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means of going to court,” he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait," he says.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not even cover the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that angers the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that highlights in red.
"The rental increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of CZK 7.50 per month per square meter," it says on the screen.
Only increased by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, 19.66 crowns per square meter," RPG said.
In 2,600 flats, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not affect rents suddenly, but will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, he adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rental increase (see the graph) back into the floors, mainly in savings on heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rental increase agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need daycare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides in its interior a small nursery with all its own to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can attend.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio many well-known buildings in Brno emerged, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-garden.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the daycare is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Design to its workers within the framework of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with childcare.
The mini-childcare was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-childcare is financed through the European Social Fund under the Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme, as well as the Czech State budget.
Thanks to the financing granted (more than CZK 2.8 million) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding runs out (two years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to keep the mini-custody running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the submission of the funding application.
The care of the children is in the hands of qualified personnel; a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The day-care centre currently accommodates children without age limit, although most of them are under three years old.
Since it is a "mini-guard", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to suit the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is a matter of individual education and care, the contents of the mini-kindergarten programme are comparable to the regular pre-school programme.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach English.
The classroom has not only toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can visit their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program reinforced the marketing of staff.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its skeleton-like shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all of this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with dreamlike lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and carefully thought out order are observed.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Snake and the twisting of forms continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the window frames, railings, door trims, gazebos and signs.
Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gràcia, arose from the remodeling of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his plans of the project emerged ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of the successful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol took part in the construction of Gaudí’s Casa Milá and Güell Park, where other pieces of it can be found.
Because of its organic form, the locals shortly after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawns".
It is also said that, at the top of the building, the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motifs.
Gaudí projected in the house a unique system for the time of central heating with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Its inclination of forty-five degrees may be odd.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect at all the building norms of the moment and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so shocked by the result that it asked for correction.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
Arrangements were never made, rather on the contrary: just fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, of six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the living rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without having to give up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and skylights.
The play with the two colors brings maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which instead absorb the sun’s rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious apartment and the most recharged of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open their doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and tourist card holders get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of entry of other Gaudí buildings into the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly befriend a resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How the mattress and bedspread are chosen: women and men look for different things
Nothing from a pompous frame for the bed; what really lends its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the bedspread.
First and foremost, they must be perfectly complemented so that they can be adapted to specific users.
During the choice numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, state of health and gender of the owner.
It is also important the type of interior in which the mattress and the bedspread are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the center channels are not properly aerated and above are on a firm base, they keep moisture inside.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft coat and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
“Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have problems with the nervous system, so they receive poor information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem anymore, because they have these suitable Tempur and Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate viscoelasticity.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes its stiffness and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn around like after a hard game.
He just sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to your height the length of your feet, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example singles, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk to your elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert at Cechu <0xC4><0x8D>alouník<0xC5><0xAF> a decoratér<0xC5><0xAF>, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for many years.
In double rooms, each one needs its own bedspread and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bedspreads at different heights, which is not always possible on all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with springs interior a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you sit on the mattress, you should certainly not notice the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a particular type of bedspread.
Fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and you can not wash your cover, which today is often done.
And since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a but.
For this reason, sellers give a tip: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of cleaning and washing the cover carefully, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers with zipper closure are currently manufactured throughout its perimeter, so when opening them they remain in two parts (something very important for the washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in the larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a bedside table, do you have a firm board?
Never! Never!
As much for the beds designed for one night visits.
However, you should make (if you do not already have them) ventilation holes in the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulatable sheet bedspreads containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although a bedspread with a larger number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar region are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated is always better.
Articulating sheet pads should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "surround" the shoulders perfectly during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is very important.
They are even remembered by the manufacturers of mattresses that, in the "males", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are so-called multi-torsion cushioned cross-frame or tablet beds.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the right mattress and bedspread, if you use a bad pillow (large and "muffled"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach to the shoulders, so that the muscles of them can be relaxed.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying sideways, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder-reinforced bed base or softer area of the mattress) as shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Increasingly, manufacturers continue to use natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, organic mattresses are in fashion.
The petroleum-based raw materials, with which the polyurethane foam is manufactured, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers employ soybeans.
"Biologic, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the company Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "cooled" with breeze vegetable extracts, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warmth.
Favourites now?
Cold foam mattresses, which are more porous, have an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane mattresses and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam stiffnesses makes it possible to manufacture mattresses of various zones that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as sanitary means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and bedspreads.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second one is free.
The era of viscoelasticism with an open cellular structure and high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during the take-offs astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens in the heat and hardens in the cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for medical devices, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents are using people-tracking devices to monitor their children
Fear for children leads more and more people to think about monitoring them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
At the moment the device has the approximate size of a matchbox, but it will soon shrink to the size of a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We're all trying to tell ourselves that it's not spying, it's another way to decrease the chances of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I recognize that, in certain cases, you can abuse such devices, for example if they get into someone’s bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases.”
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková warns about the fact that if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even the youngest children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled.”
“In the past, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková says.
In his opinion, it is questionable whether in the event of an attack such a device is really useful.
“If it is a prepared kidnapping, the perpetrator will practically always check if the child is carrying any kind of electronic device that can reveal his or her location.”
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices expands, it will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be made with a lot of publicity."
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an impromptu attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence can help.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period."
“If he suffers damage, he will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question.”
“The most expensive devices have a built-in tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and remains immobile, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his view, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, in which only special software must be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a similar size to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, that is why tests are currently being conducted with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
“Or identifying him after a certain time, which can save the police time,” he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will still use the same technology that is used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to encircle the whole of the Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to set up explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of wick to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosives wick from STV Group, a. s. for forty million kroner.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such an enormous amount of wick by saying that the soldiers need for the training maneuvers 60 kilometers of wick a year.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, with whom MF DNES was in contact, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, they should perform such manoeuvres with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
Neither Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr nor Army Captain Vlastimil Picek wanted to be exempt.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend sixty kilometers of wick.
Such a length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have enough stocks for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid-intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, thus limiting even the practice of shooting for money.
And let’s not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also cannot understand that they repeatedly buy us such quantities of wick."
“But it’s their decision and they’ll certainly know why they act like that.”
“For us, the military is a good customer that we as a company try to satisfy,” admits STV Group sales director Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek defends the hundreds of miles of wick, saying he will also have stockpiles of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of STV Group indicates that the wick only has a shelf life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition should be carefully checked to see if it is still reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of wick, he got a discount.
“They cost us 60% less than last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” said Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry’s shopping center.
Just to compare: the annual wick consumption of the police pyrotechnicians, who remove the ammunition from the Second World War or that left by the Soviet army, no longer exceeds 1,500 meters.
In addition, the police always ask only the right amount to deplete the ammunition before its useful life ends.
They decided this for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable wick types can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: it will be necessary to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I am still living from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
The fact of winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun in the sale of the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story seems to have been taken from a movie.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that quality accommodation at a good price was needed in Liberec.
With the savings he gathered with seasonal jobs abroad and a loan from the bank he bought a house that was half-ruined composed of five floors.
Considering he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
"At present, the value for money of the accommodation in our area pushed me to do something about it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He began renting the reconstructed first floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested back in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he managed to gradually open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” the number one entrepreneur said last year.
"This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels greatly helped the fact of winning the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' contest," Pytloun adds gratefully.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in and around Liberec.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” she recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends everyone who wants to try some company that participates in the contest.
But he considers that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live on contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I started collaborating regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
In total about seventy.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to be involved in something that has garnered overall recognition.”
“It’s not my own personal success, it’s the result of the hard work of the whole team.”
"It is only my name that appears on the front page," says today modestly Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we've had at Farmet.
The euphoria for victory was soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone contest "Company of the Year", last year at the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition,” says last year’s winner.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the state proposed to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>'s father the rent of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo of property during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic piles.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They gained a greater presence also among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the competition in the media.
“Not only did our customers start to see the Farmet brand as considerably better, but foreign partners also started to value the collaboration with a company that was most successful in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year may not have been Farmet just a sign of the euphoria of victory.
It was also recognized for its commercial results up to 2008 and, partially, 2009.
2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
“We obviously didn’t get rid of such a situation either.”
“Revenue was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must, at times, take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company’s profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut spending was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training center, strengthened our presence in the international market and obtained excellent ratings at national fairs," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenue is rising again and, with it, the number of new employees.
“The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey revealing ridiculous norms
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He has already succeeded in removing some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration asked for an extract from the trade register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when it carries out a check of the insured's taxation," said <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová.
The objective of the Absurdity of the year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year, he is part of the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny business tournament for the fourth time and is also starting to attract fans from the general public.
While last year’s edition was attended by 3,000 voters, this year it practically reached 4,000.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in terms of the number of papers needed for tax returns we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is in the 74th position, that is, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
For this year’s survey, more than 100 were submitted, including 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
Examples were sent by entrepreneurs, professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals this year is published on the pages of the contest.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, the competition was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be sustained if the state continually puts obstacles on entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," said Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in borage.
In 2007, people were most upset by the employer’s obligation to notify the business office in the permanent operation area three days in advance of their intention to attend a trade fair or exhibition with a position.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that finished second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the labor office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
The third is the defeat.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their office a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
This is why this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny contest is the category called Responsible Company of the year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s Vodafone Enterprise main competition of the year 2010 companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between one and the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example the disabled, in others the personal or health problems of the employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main donor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, there is a stationery shop that is especially concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the workforce; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the year contest it finished third in the region.
In Olomouc won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours even below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded to them because they buy primarily from Czech manufacturers, support community activities in the area and respect the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment,” explains businesswoman Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit of the <0xC3><0x9A>stí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them a chair and ergonomic keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona in Trouble scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the representative of the company Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
The laundry company Praní a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>ní in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that affect their pension funds, are also in good position with a mention.
"We give benefits in food, transport, skills improvement and leisure," says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D> of the winning Bruntál Czasch construction company in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the Responsible Company of the Year category, all regional finalists for the Vodafone Enterprise of the Year contest were automatically selected who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it to the organizers before August 15.
Organizers removed forms that were not complete or incorrect from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year contest, but are not disqualified from the Vodafone Company of the Year "main" contest."
"Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main Company of the Year competition," explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose consultancy.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police have made several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land was received by a specific interested party.
He owed half a million kroner to Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. for this.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender," Plze<0xC5><0x88>'s chief prosecutor Antonie Zelená told Pravo, adding that she could not disclose further details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On how he could influence the public auction, given the little official information, one can only speculate.
Agricultural Fund spokeswoman Lubomíra <0xC4><0x8C>erná responded to Právo’s questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
“This is a customer, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public auction is called "Call for submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the Land Law" and is conducted when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a value higher than that of their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Based on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the largest offer," explained the spokeswoman of the Fund.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had information on who was to apply for the call and, since he was both an interested person because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
So, he paid a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of his arrest, he had so much money on him.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has just obtained from the Fund land intended for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular on the site where a large road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Later, he exchanged them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city had to intervene because otherwise blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay an additional expense of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns a month from the portfolio from January onwards.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The increase in electricity for families living in apartments is expected to amount to about 100 crowns more per year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers lowered prices, as support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics, has increased.
However, gas is moderately expensive, especially at a time when heating is used the most and, therefore, consumption is higher.
In this case, they should also have a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are expensive across the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an additional 50 kroner per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay an additional 1,000 kroner per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to endure a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Pragueers will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will increase by 7.4%.
The prices of the rental of 450,000 apartments rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January, can increase considerably.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, will increase rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take to court those who do not agree with the new rent.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 flats, could increase by as much as 10 percent next year.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in fashion, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause them to end up in medical care young drinkers under the age of fifteen.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome a hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
“Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get them drunk.”
"Fashion is now strong alcoholic beverages," says Pravo the head of pediatrics at Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán.
"When they manage to get their dad a bottle from the locker, it may be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
“Vodka has the advantage that it lightens with juice and it doesn’t smell that much,” he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's about Fernet or rum."
"Those are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
“In some cases, they use brandy that they picked up at home,” Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, thirteen- and fourteen-year-old drinkers usually appear in hospitals.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics at Motol, where ambulances were taking young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, plus a mixture with ecstasy," the department's doctor said.
"He was at the Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice fair at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother was not surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours," he said.
It is precisely the parents’ lack of interest or even their clear tolerance for drinking on the part of their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot properly speak of dependence.
"An alcoholic is a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” explains Chief Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman Jurinová, this year at the pediatric clinic of Motol forty drunken children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, the statistics only show those who come with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who go home with their parents or the police after a medical examination do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink brandy, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs that should be mentioned: Halloween, New Year's Day and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the start of the holidays."
“On Witches’ Day I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunken children at once,” adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided with the injection of a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
"These are much better off, because after the hectic night, they get up well and don't hurt at all."
“They’re just confused about where they are,” Pelikán says, adding that patients often lose their sense of humor at least when they see the expenses they’ve incurred.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization in a room for severe patients can cost tens of thousands of crowns.
“I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a job for young people so that you would earn enough to pay for yourself that night,” adds Pelikán.
Health insurance, in his view, perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 jets found for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time such a device has been found in the hands of anyone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad to perform internship or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which until now was used by the Czech army and which was still in a state of flying.
The three remaining aircraft are the L-159 single-seaters.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peje<0xC5><0xA1>k of the defence press department says it is not yet known when the planes will physically withdraw from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seaters, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, with no additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The two-seater L-159T1s were exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for the amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seater aircraft.
One of the new planes was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has pledged that the aircraft will be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
“The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for the practices of pilots from NATO countries.”
“It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this framework,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek says.
The newspaper Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense management claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159s overseas.
The Czech army has acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already sued the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa aircraft and the last one is expected to arrive at Kbely airport in 14 days.
A longer index finger than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the ring index are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that relative finger length may be a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to the age of 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should have a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with genetic risk or other damaging factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same odds of getting prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under the age of 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows the study, but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can be "fully demonstrated".
Czech Republic in the snow: D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly covered by compact snow and the snowplow machines circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between kilometers 89 and 93 towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC5><0x99>edního automotoklubu (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
In kilometer 91 a truck broke down, in 93 two commercial vehicles collided and injured.
Several cars also ended up in the gutter.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
Drivers must drive slowly behind Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and join at kilometer 182 in K<0xC3><0xBD>valce.
There have been several miles of traffic jams.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7oC.
Congestions are forming for example in Prosek, although <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí and Nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí Míru.
At eight in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections by three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check what the current situation is.
The Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> airport was closed from 11 p.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Currently, it can be used on most roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brn<0xC4><0x9B>nska snow tongues are forming and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Milling machines will be required to clear them.
At the moment it is not possible to say when they will be opened to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region that, as a protected natural area, simply have to be left inert, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall is gradually falling in the Czech Republic.
U.S. Soldiers Have a New “Smart Weapon”
The U.S. military is employing in Afghanistan a new “smart” weapon, known at the moment only by the codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" will make its victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with an extremely precise aim.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains causes it to actually work like a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when hitting the target, but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, wall or trench.
No doubt, normal protection cannot be used, and when it throws its murderous rain of metal chips, it may prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use “smart” technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point at it with their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the line of projection and squeezes the trigger."
"Let's say 543 meters have been measured."
“When the trigger is pressed, the weapon loads and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, minus one, two or three meters,” says Audette.
400 jobs are being moved.
The Fujitsu consortium moves its Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will move their workplace from their previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance giant reported on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman said that in the medium term another 100 employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "At Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday sparked joy among those in favor and disappointment among those against.
Frankfurt’s head of economics, Markus Frank (CDU), said that he has earned a “Global Player”.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site".
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu’s decision.
The management informed the city earlier about his intention.
“Of course we have offered the company our help,” Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons led to the fall.
In such a way, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The building previously used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial construction project of the spa city.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the city council, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the spaces as parking spaces and the level of the buildings.
In 2001 were installed the investment advisory and appraisal companies, the manufacturer of Software for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the company manufacturer of computers Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu consortium is recognized as the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more businesses in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is located from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company under the name of TDS.
That’s why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twenties, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anxiety is increasingly taking over WikiLeaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is reportedly detained in England.
The Wikileaks revelation platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently searching for an internet homeland in Europe.
U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman is calling on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks ejected from Amazon server."
"Speaking freely in the country of freedom," the activists said via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services website in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: “We will spend our dollars hiring people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server through Wikileaks after an employee of Sen. Joe Lieberman requested investigations, CNN reported, according to a call to Lieberman’s office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the Guardian reported.
“I had wished that Amazon would take these steps earlier, before previous classified information releases through WikiLeaks,” he said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban the use of the server in other countries.
“The illegal, monstrous and thoughtless process of WikiLeaks puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world,” the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently labeled the investigation in Sweden as a plot by his enemy.
WikiLeaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there have been threats.
“There were even calls about an assassination of Julian Assange.”
That’s why he fears for Assange’s safety, Hrafnsson said.
The location of the founder of WikiLeaks remains unclear.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to North American statements.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee said the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations should be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, one adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, clearly with irony, on television, Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange there is a growing dispute.
U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had asked for the secretary of state's resignation, should she be responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and this country’s interests are much stronger than its website.”
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counter-Terrorism Center, has been appointed as an exceptional commissioner, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing “the important structural reforms” that are needed in light of the Wikileaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the overall information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
“We have done everything we can to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are prepared to help protect them if necessary.”
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream parlors are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice-creamers has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
The ice cream maker and the ice cream maker.
The gelato maker makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The ice cream maker pulls the ice cream out of the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the bar and sells it.
To know this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with freezer in the year 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice-creamers has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special, longer-day courses on chocolate ice cream and practices at the ice cream parlor in the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk in the soft ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a California professor of this art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of their bar ice cream, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Ice cream master Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal qualities of perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training nor the cream cover of the national and mainly southern top house: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step in the preparation seems very easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it down to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and a pasteurized white basic cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises them to disregard the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream "not only natural ingredients", perhaps has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, guar bean.
Of course, you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a sonorous granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to strain flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"You must, however, experiment sometime."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a base for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Course participants can now use the freezers.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
Whether you know better does not necessarily depend on whether you have more toffee aroma or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to taste nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the beloved kiwifruit ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
First, a balanced blend highlights the flavor of ice cream, Luciano says.
The preparation of ice cream is a problem of artimetics: Peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, you have to reduce the sugar ratio of the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano pulls out a utensil with which he sets the amount of sugar from the types of fruit (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
It not only helps the tool for automatic processing of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to sub-zero temperature.
In spite of everything, all the automation is left out as far as the little pasta is concerned.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his peers from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if he were an uncontrolled giant mini-first.
“In all courses,” says maestro Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has infiltrated the industry experimenting with GMO plants.
This issue is currently raised by the expert group Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the EFSA group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another EFSA expert are also hired for years at the association Ilsi.
Consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has significantly collaborated on EFSA’s testing rules for genetically modified plants, which places him in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the deed of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking Efsa manager went without the support or transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side with that.
Recently, the Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the General Office for the Environment as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, EFSA cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some from the industry, are used, as long as they are of a high and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at EFSA are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But you must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the mandate of Lobby.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that currently GM plants are allowed without researching food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,” Then says.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how are you going to find them?” asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For businesses, critical studies are not published as a rule.
“Industry controls security research,” Hilbeck says.
The Trail of the Stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was in front of Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on my back.
There were demonstrations
Snowy.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to shoot down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing became debris.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They shouldn't disappear."
He excites himself: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he's smelled cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tübingen in a former French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He bought everything that came out of the demolition in Stuttgart.
“There would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or send it to the garbage dump,” says in his office, a wooden cottage that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the company of downings.
He spoke with the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downing.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram massif cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a memory but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the rest has long since been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from all over and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of momentum has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“This stone is really nothing special,” says Rongen.
"If it weren't for the political component."
He climbs into his SUV, takes a tour of his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
He is a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the country's largest trader of ancient stones.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones chopped.
“They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge,” he explains.
Dawn clay, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
It points out a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Nice travertine."
Formerly the massifs belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police station, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tuff from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple rig and a wagon, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave stone traders, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man who takes advantage of the remains.
Soon he'll have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to be rescued.
Fighting talent around great potentials
There is an active affluence at the buffet.
16 students crowd around the muffins, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited the students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Competing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, come together in a melee fight around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Its mission: to hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labor market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications on their students’ skills, they try to spot exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins over the talents.
A lady from the staff department distributes pens, rubbers and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the excited young talents the internship programs and student jobs and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
See advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
“In turn, VW can get to know students, look more closely at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
“The main point previously was in the technical projects,” Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to advertise and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), in October there were 40,000 vacancies for engineers.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineer gap will grow even more.
At the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of the talent hunt.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the start.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to pick and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
“With the race we want to stand out from the crowd.”
"The simple journey alone was too short."
For the Dykta talent scout the notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
“Some are nearing their end, and want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, small and medium-sized companies, classic with their work fairs, are also on the hunt.
"We try to get students in the specialized fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, staff manager for solar technology maker Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company ' s website.
"It's becoming very difficult to fill vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, Freiberg University.
“The teachers advise that you can do internships with us or do your theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium can’t normally offer it,” says Stübe, the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, childcare or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager also expects extra points in her classification for her job seekers.
“I think the applicant is especially concerned about the external classifications of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the own staff.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” Kriegler says.
Obama halts new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in recent years.
The Washington government issued a vehement ban and thereby annulled its previous plans in an unappealable manner.
Also before the Atlantic coast remain new drillings forbidden for the moment.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What triggered this strict ban, which will be in effect for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Before the misfortune that claimed the lives of eleven workers and sparked America’s biggest environmental catastrophe, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce U.S. reliance on new foreign oil supplies.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of lawsuits.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, different peterol consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by employing tougher controls and tighter security regulations.
At present, the responsible supervisory authority, which has been accused of corruption and has fallen into disrepute, is being radically reformed.
In parallel, Obama announces that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries,” says the result of the current poll conducted by advisory firm BDO – ahead of Wednesday’s extraction ban.
American Energey Alliance complains of insecurity in the sector: “No one knows exactly what changes with regulation.”
Investments in new extraction projects are for the foreseeable future, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of oil spilled have shattered nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and the illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari likes it.
“Don’t get tired,” the environmental activist reassures journalists: “Today enough oil will pass before your eyes.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful brightness of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil spots float on the surface.
Before here he picked prawns in handfuls, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most stinky regions in the world.
On the way through the mangrove river, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the engine of the ship removes a brown broth, who immerses his hand in the water, will draw a few full of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the palm trees that collide and hanging their palms.
In vain flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the external barrier is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of a former paradise with the smell of a petrol station expands in it.
"What's happening here is an ecological struggle," says hurricane Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
The warlike comparison proceeds.
The area of the Ogoni settlement has been a battlefield for years: here the first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
While they pumped more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters steel platforms protruded like bizarre water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most exhibiting total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, Akpobari thinks, then a constant jet of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see breaking heads and leaking pipes as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the conventional world, the scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the pipe defect rates are "on a greater multiple than elsewhere".
In a place that from a distance seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Between one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the drillings, sometimes arbitrarily scattered over the ground, there is a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil heats up in the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the group’s head.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally diesel salt.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce daily up to four barrels of diesel of 300 liters: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about 22 dollars.
Delta dwellers are harnessing fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per liter illegal heaters can offer even less: So they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", who tricked the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million litres of oil are lost a day in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the stockpiled provisional raw material is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the best part in cisterns and sell it cheaply on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers purely academic the debate over whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to population management or to the loose mode of production.
“If the oil companies did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no robberies, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the ogoni are shattered mostly by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Maybe it is better to present another nationality, like the Chinese."
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular <0xC3><0x96>lmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the special army unit seizes the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This damned invention has completely shattered our country,” Akpobari said.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, investigators found a possible factory defect, which can produce “a catastrophic engine failure.”
Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than you can imagine: Australian aviation safety authorities perceived thanks to their investigations a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report published Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline is taking legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court in Sydney that enabled further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
Parts have been lost at the engine mark and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers have announced that they will carry out more safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replenished the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double deck aircraft is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Nevada Across the Country Causes Traffic Chaos
Totally white Germany: Overnight it has snowed almost all over the country.
In many streets, chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Frosty temperatures were reached throughout most of the country overnight on Thursday, triggering chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a 15 centimeter thick layer of snow.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the snowplows are in continuous operation, removing the new snow again and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong wind gusts sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects high tides with water levels 1.2 meters above their usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds are in charge of swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported significant disturbances in the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disruptions are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, trees falling on the lanes or the broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service attended to the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, winds with snow caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokeswoman for Fraport, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The snowplows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few stranded passengers at the airport, despite that there are 400 field beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a crossroads in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg a similar accident occurred because of the snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver lost his life.
In the train four passengers were injured, the journey from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
A 30-year-old woman was also killed after her car overturned near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be increasingly soft and dusty and will therefore swirl in gentle streaks.
But the wind will subside.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and rapid winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Deoche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for buyers for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutsche Bank arranged its headquarters: Twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district were modernized; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the renewal, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland claims based on a spokesperson.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again," he said.
This is why Germany’s largest lending institution is relinquishing its company headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investor in a house fund and then made arrangements for it.
The energy reforms reached figures of around 200 million euros.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper’s towers renamed “Greentowers” at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold on a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed at this time, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourning the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who took for granted after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago, an intense explosion occurred at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced into the place of misfortune, but discovered no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts inferred that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, family and friends remember the deceased with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shining sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand’s South Island.
They were silent for two minutes.
In tribute to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, underneath clothing and surfboards.
The flags waved at half-mast in front of the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand waited for the miners to return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, told participants in the memorial event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose Zen son was buried in the mine.
Alongside the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative event.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are removed, the scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police superior Gary Knowles told reporters.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does the gore fit into artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the frontiers of the genre with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising."
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior imprisoned with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman struggles, it sounds ideal for young viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and rip his enemies’ guts from their bodies alive when in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the backstage offer to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for filmmakers who have grown up and are interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has multiple groups of recipients it is a pity that they cannot rule each other out.
Director Winding Refn views his savages and the drug-trafficking "Pusher" trilogy as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with something more mainstream humor or something less of the artistic house's brutality.
A burgeoning brain mass and guts cannot deter most fans of art film.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck for an eternity in the calm and fog before his team reaches America and shuts up again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, hides a piece of cinema sometimes exciting, that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
There is no escape for spectators.
Refn is just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy trance soundtrack make a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a small blonde young man, who faithfully supports Unojo, preserves something as innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only to those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to be angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
About midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the bucket, hidden in a valley that flows out of the river.
According to information from the US international intelligence service of the CIA of late April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the vicinity of el-Kibar very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
Instead, the technique barely serves other purposes than those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or inside.
The reactor was not long ago in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is hardly better known than at that time, the riddles became bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack the CIA was totally sure that the Syrians had built a reactor on the Kibar, but that he saw little sign that there was “a nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a “supposed reactor”, although they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible”.
They lack solid evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor ahead, a senior UN diplomat responded lapidarily in the summer that the IAEA has “enough material to have questions.”
The Syrians quickly cleared the debris of the alleged “unused military building” and cleared the ground consciously.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by humans.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, of commercial vendors in the moments just after the attack, which must have a greater informative value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always implied that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after analysis of the particles.
Damaskus has since refused to discuss it, as well as satellite images.
In addition, controllers are barred from a second inspection at el-Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
“We will never comment,” Ehud Olmert, the acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "progressively transforms into a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds with a seat at the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation against the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which the IAEA watches over, is pending.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be “in functional connection” with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not publicly disclosed so far what equipment is being treated, what functions it has, or whether it appears to be suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated as interns Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariyah, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which most likely is one of the suspected objects.
Possibly located in or immediately next to a military base, Syria prohibits for this reason entry to the three sites to the IAEA.
In Vienna, Syrians are said to fear a record that the U.S. has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to warnings from the U.S. Secret Service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has evidence that material is moving between the three sites and the cube to the Euphrates bank.
A Western diplomat with a senior post in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be “related to fuel production.”
But there is “no indication of sensitive activities,” neither of uranium enrichment nor reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium must come from and where the plutonium must subsequently be separated for the bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
Nor is there any doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargo trucks disappeared from the ground, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometres from the Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as an area for radioactive waste, unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show the Syrians made land movements at the three suspected locations and cleared large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months to develop a plan of inspections there, which the Syrians allowed, to maintain the possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, since a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador fencing the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who should propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: To do so, a majority of the IAEA Governing Council is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: "And what if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie began in the summer with the direction of her still unnamed debut.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women’s associations have protested quickly, with the result that at the last moment they moved some planned shooting days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women’s war victims’ organization wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, she told a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There are no love stories given in the rape camps, and Jolie’s position on that betrays the victims enough about the script.
Her organization in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended removing Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly has Jolie written for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, gave behind a pull and loose a recording permit in Sarajevo, it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go after all.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she introduces herself with great effort in the Yugoslav conflict, she wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
Its content is still inaccurate.
The lovers were together before the start of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim falls in love with torturer".
It is certain that Jolie’s film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Currently they can make peace with the Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here
This afternoon is finally good again for the Irish.
No trace of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans scream for joy as loud music rumbles, hitting the floor with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in South-Irish Cork, because the players throw, and find, ping-pong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few air tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quirky drinking game and the discreet computer really don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old boy tries to have fun with that, distract himself from the fulminant question, what the future holds for him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's a long way from home and I don't have a job there yet."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "of a shot got the job of his dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three siblings have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in London.
The young people leave: There are many families on the island like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, economics experts and the social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015, there were 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, coming a wave of migration comparable to that suffered by the island in the eighties.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses especially the young, well-trained Irish, for whom so far, everything is uphill.
The job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes and loses our country and with it an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students Union, sees a bleak future appear because the government is only engaged in assemblies and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
“They cut minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to get new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
Observe how your peers go from unreported practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to look at this issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the theme of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," says the manager.
On his website there are photos of a boy practicing surf in Australia and another practicing snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it entails freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O’Donovan has known what it’s like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 fellow Irish builders in Germany.
They are now building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hanover or Berlin for the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to be able to pay off a loan for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a bit crazy,” he says, since it was a long time ago from the first time he stepped on the threshold of his house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, which I've never been so good at."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes to icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with well-kept gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a credit.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears nowadays.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is by far not as dramatic as in past times here on the island,” he says.
“Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel like Irish for the first time.”
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He already worked a couple of years in London, and why wouldn’t he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But nowadays there is one thing that worries him very much: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he might degenerate into a farewell party.
“Only, not too much emotion,” he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Farewell, it sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private companies.
Crime raises more concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor that reigns in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in a number of countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a sharp decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but significantly higher than 25 per cent in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted their country ' s Congress and 45 per cent trusted their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only marginally increased in 2009 and has declined again this year, to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
Such sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
About 31 per cent said they or a close relative had been a victim of crime in the past year, down from 38 per cent last year and the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: about 71 per cent of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see figure 6).
Around 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same way (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the Garbage
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, it was much worse than feared by foreigners trying to help the country recover from its problems.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the sewers, polling stations destroyed and acts of intimidation.
The electoral colleges opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking UN official in Haiti, said it was “a relatively good election in many ways.”
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously affirmed that "we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and to his candidate, Jude Célestin, is expected to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tiebreaker is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes have yet been lost in relation to the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has hardly any support, if any, has passed the second round.
With the cholera epidemic ravaging the country and more than a million earthquake survivors still living in tents, a large abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 identity documents, required to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the election of a legitimate people’s government to be an essential step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And, as it has become clear, the Haitians themselves think so.
Advancing toe-to-toe towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernandez, has enjoyed great public sympathy that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite everything, whether she can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s election will depend on whether the clearly affected Ms. Fernandez leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was accustomed to drafting budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened since Kirchner’s death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the ruling Peronist movement have clashed with Ms. Fernandez.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
The 2010 budget will therefore be applied to next year, which will give the President even more room for action when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow as much as 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, place it at about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, put pressure on the private sector and had INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez moderate these policies now?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum for growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is why Mrs Fernandez is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernandez is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF oversight, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the prelude to the cleanup of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernandez wants to remain in politics after her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have waned.
If you want to win another election, you will have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of your husband’s policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Taiwanese voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of those eligible, came on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councilors of five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become an advocate of sentiments for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has been inclined towards full independence from Taiwan, won virtually 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s vote share has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in town halls.
In the elections we could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy field trucks and large crowds with banners and light clothes girls dancing.
Neither did the mysterious attempted murder of rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, injuring and killing a passer-by.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the election, sowing suspicion about the PPD and causing voters to lean toward the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not concerned.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China’s military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoids publicizing its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time also the PPD avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma said that his policy towards China had been confirmed to be acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue bribing them with trade, in line with its strategy to get Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly like to achieve political integration as well, but the first thing is the first thing.
The best thing to do is to wait until the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under Mrs. Tsai’s leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PDP is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai has been welcomed as a candidate of the PDP for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to show that he can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Mrs. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said the PDP candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intercession, the PDP will struggle to choose among its potential candidates.
The KMT should also do an examination of conscience.
Mr. Ma’s valuations have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will restructure its cabinet as well as the local teams.
The PPD’s large samples suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Revelation Artist.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys’ surprises this year with a top-notch nomination for Best Breakthrough Artist.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination is thought-provoking, but respects the Grammys rules that it must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" was undoubtedly a breakthrough and, given his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop, funk and Latin rhythm influences, one can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the path to success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammys voters, who have lately focused on jazz.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity,” an exciting and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a roaring New Orleans favorite and regular guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise leans considerably towards fusion as on the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy’s wild punk James Argue’s Secret Society earned well-deserved recognition in the big band category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risking Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, “Pathways,” was a great example of the bassist’s democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Director of Classical Albums
Classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The top nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, five-movement, and Steve Mackey for "Dreamhouse", an eclectic three-movement orchestral work.
Nominees with links to Southern California include Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories spanning orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The Classic Producer of the Year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the Classical Music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Castri and Synergy Vocals; the "Sacrificium" of the Choquificium.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" by the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the National Orchestra; and Marinsky's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra.
Grammy-nominated composers for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Passionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed “Los Angeles” and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for him to play on mandolin Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral function category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the ordinance commission
The mosque project for Temecula has garnered unanimous support from the local ordination commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, members of the commission decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
“Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha’is, of all religions,” Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said Thursday morning.
“The truth is, as an American citizen, I’m proud of it.”
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
“They just speak very loudly.”
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at six in the afternoon and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people interceding for or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“The United States no longer exists,” reads one of the comments.
“This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand.”
“America has fallen.”
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of nearly 135 families has been living together seamlessly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtering systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, in a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the bill to the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it demonstrates that it is possible for life to exist without the main elements they considered essential.
"This body has a dual capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That makes it a very peculiar thing, although it’s close to becoming a truly ‘alien’ way of life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in Thursday’s online edition of the journal Science.
There have long been thought to be six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, given that researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated great speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of 'standard' elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has elevated levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could substitute one for the other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, to put it in a way, overwhelms the biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they were able to adapt to and use to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but demonstrating that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form that uses arsenic can naturally exist, whether in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced with phosphorus is not new, but an example of how it works has never been found.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth eras, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there might be other ways to generate life, not just the way life formed on Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Missing stolen dogs found in Compton
The two missing dogs of the four stolen dogs have been found outside the Bellflower Motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office said Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, went missing Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express pickup truck they were spending the night in front of Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met late Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They have returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
“An investigation is underway.”
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's aides found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been damaged.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit at local competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the national AKC/Eukanuba championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were to be exhibited in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly two-month tour participating in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their room window.
They carried three other dogs (a puppy boxer, a Terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and they would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van theft Tuesday morning at 6:00 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, endowed with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, as MGM’s restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to wipe out about $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and television shows.
Thursday’s ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal hurdles for MGM to relaunch under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the lead executives of what will be a reduced studio.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In reality, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The firm’s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert on bankruptcy recovery, known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial tribulations and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that the creditors were looking for.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially goes out of bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-billion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company’s management services, will receive a “successful fee” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit," along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to settle a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep its gift budget balanced
While the iPad is the top contender to be this year’s most wonderful toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even slightly less compared to last year’s.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with partner websites, two of the best-known of their kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And toys powered by button batteries are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless stated otherwise.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and older) are plush toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when their bellies are tightened.
A squeeze is equivalent to a note, and a second squeeze begins to assemble a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once it begins to squeeze, it cannot stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift-shifting games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar step, thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheels with locking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and up), with a backpack full of letters of questions designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correction exercise notebook occurring.
If you are wary of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years old), it is the first major tuning of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, ages 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot for viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a five-block game just bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to assemble words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it’s formidable for an improvised word-running competition.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on its presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6-12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough Club Penguin store credits for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of button-cell-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside the mouth of our dog.
Promoting a more moderate side of maintaining order in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the pass in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, the corpulent policemen of China’s urban order, feared and despised for their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"First!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls who barely passed their teens in white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and tight pants to get attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed above the hair tied with blue and white striped buns.
"Personally, I think they look normal," Mr. Tang said, contemptuously.
"The models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a bachelor's degree.
Guangdong Province changed the uniforms' grayish green color to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating looks: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a tricky snack cart, and watched it with a constantly frown for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, expressly chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s tiny respect for these squads of the city.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province beat a passerby to death after using his cellphone to film them as they disbanded a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and posted on the internet, describing how to effectively whip criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street vendor suffered brain damage after a brawl with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar on the government,” China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded “really meticulous cleaning.”
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if the women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure “and the five harmonious facial features.”
They must have been above average height, above 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Withdrawal at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said the job was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
“His image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
“First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.”
Then comes the temperament "and inner qualities."
The female chengguan are like vases, he said, adding, "in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district’s city administration office, is not eager to back up that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard on many Chinese job postings for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not present themselves.
“We can’t allow a lame person or a humpback to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his red cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His fellow dimple worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also don’t object to their time-bound work, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply chasing salespeople into the alleys where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squad faces roughly a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many buns or bowls of tofu as possible before they are thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
“We’ve told you so many times!” said Miss Xu as a salesman ran off on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn cart with noodle trims.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is pretty much the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare hours.
“Very routine.”
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise from the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, mutinied after false rumors spread that some chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen police or chengguan officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has avoided such violence.
Calm is barely guaranteed.
Just two blocks from peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle screamed loudly.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, made their way to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men’s squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned around to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said quite naturally.
“Most of the time it’s the audience that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not bring charges against Senator Ensign
The senator’s attorneys announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have acquitted Senator John Ensign of criminal charges stemming from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said it was "certainly pleased" with the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plan to bring charges against him on this issue.”
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have colluded to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, obtain lucrative lobbying work to silence Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator’s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as the treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban," which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to drop prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens amid procedural misconduct charges.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s top lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another phone call the next day, telling him the department did not want to file charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to show that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got work through lobbying thanks to Ensign’s help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him he was "crushing" the Home Office over a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, she said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department’s lead and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign is eager to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them “chatting” in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the appalling testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, is set to come to an official end, with the imposition of the death penalty judge voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have filed court papers outlining the arguments for appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years to come.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports about the process, including widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appellate judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“Based on what I experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual’s rights to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Hayes’ senior defense attorney.
Trial Judge Jon C. Blue of the State Superior Court laconically dismissed the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media were “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeals courts have recognized that coverage of celebrity cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in the Sheppard v. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the television program and the movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes’s conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media” on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many topics outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pushed for a verdict for his bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process may attract most interest.
They noted in a rebuttal to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually firewood the fire of emotion over the case.
“The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps across the state.”
Their focus on Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly was a ludicrous view that would make the court’s policy on controlling coverage weak in future lawsuits.
But some lawyers said appeals courts were often drawn to arguments about the adaptation that was required in court due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their letter, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction due to the coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century.”
Can civics build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign of invective and negativity, this week has unleashed some civility in Washington.
Is it a harbinger of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on the major issues that need to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But by what everyone says, it was at least a courteous discussion of the two parties’ differences, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another empty episode to win partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit commission was equally civilized, despite the political differences that persist among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a trial period, probing each other to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That’s why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent evaluations of it by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep-rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are in opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed with respect to the way things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
Elections awaken partisan passions, which then become extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of it.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Likewise, there is likely to be a commitment to expanding unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can’t make people believe they’re in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START nuclear disarmament pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
“After the things that need to be done are done, in the short term psychology will revert the situation to one of confrontation,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about whether civics can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and overturn the new health care law.
Those lines of support are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase of some taxes and the retirement age, and the cut in expenditures.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been tasked with one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forcibly brought the deficit issue onto the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among elected officials on the panel, suggesting that in tax matters there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between Republicans in the White House and those in Congress.
The first will come in the form of party clashes next year, when Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch closely the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks they’re losing will likely change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partidism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as paradise of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a “cleptocracy,” leaving a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly from the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has termed the “vertical authority,” takes its share as money climbs the ladder.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he claimed: "It's crazy, a mess, a nuisance."
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, since they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
“The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional’, and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government,” the statement said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term of the criminal and mafia world that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that runs through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
“Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow’s criminal world.”
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police are targeting small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, the protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their businesses closed for one reason or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The note from the embassy reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem group of experts in Moscow, said in a recent interview.
“But he’s a part of this bureaucracy.”
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154 (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. embassy note, which did not happen until late at night Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we don’t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as “the Butcher” for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint United Nations and Cambodia court issued the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Yev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of those events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can’t do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
“For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“This is creating divisions within families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the utter misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their arms, the soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
“These people have received little benefit after surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the regime’s utopian agrarian ideology.”
“They were raised without any concept for doing business.”
Sr. Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine,” he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
“But now life is hard because we have to self-supply.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute the top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This didn't do much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at Cambodia’s Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
During a recent embarrassing afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his house on wooden piles on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She said that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” he said.
“If there is more prosecution, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court prosecutes more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to the Khmer, is to bring the broken pieces back together," he said.
“It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea," of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered in discarded plastic bags leads to a black soot rectangle covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone salesman by the roadside, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray for him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot’s last rest, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of good luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its reserve of qualified uranium for armament
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday it will give up its reserve of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the US government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations were conducted with Belarus in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of qualified uranium for weaponry from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday’s deal to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This shows that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have retained the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapon-qualified uranium) and the low-enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said he was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was done by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the research facility with low-enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that “this was very carefully coordinated and orchestrated to strengthen confidence” that led to the deal signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of qualified uranium for armaments, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential relaxation.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.”
The Spanish government did not make any objections to CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading for Guantánamo via Spanish territory, the US ambassador in Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance on foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting took place between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the report of the Council "had taken the government of Zapatero out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "picked off unprepared," Aguirre recounts on a cable.
The then Foreign Minister, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also told the ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited capacity of influence".
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez told the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
“These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information,” the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern over the “apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors”, rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007 at a luncheon between the US ambassador and the interior minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although the Spanish judges are jealous of their independence and will do whatever they deem appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP’s performance in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” he said.
The parricide confesses complained in the network of the "agobio" of being a mother
The young woman was talking about the child when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror a la gallega"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she used since she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the people of Corunna from which she originated.
The messages are from 2008.
To understand them, you need to know their love life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies from family members.
The young Galician, 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Ivan Tuñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left, it was soon known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get a DNA test.
It didn’t take long for her to get to know another boyfriend.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even went to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But from the contents of the communications, it is seen that their romance broke, that they broke up.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and mosqueado, because I have come to work."
“When I told him it was fine, but of course, now he realizes what it’s like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
Then, he speaks of a message to the mobile that he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains: “If she doesn’t like me leaving the kid with my mother, I’ll pick him up when I get back,” she says.
In May, he talks about returning to his village: "This week I am going there, but I will only be until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to show up for a job so as not to lose it".
He clarifies that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"He's going to be with whoever he owes, that is, me, and never in life will I think of leaving him again with anyone but my mother," doubtful intention given his bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When you type it, the boy, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly killed on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
“On the one hand he’s with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he’s going to class almost every day.”
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He's going there (the kid) for some summer classes, and so I save myself some kangaroo paste."
The 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says that he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck."
On the 30th, another: "The boy is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan".
From Victor, his current partner, there is one: “He advances me money.”
On the internet there are posts on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had one of his own in the now-intervened MySpace universe, where he called himself "Muki the excarcerator."
"Terror to the Galician (epígrafe) ".
The last man who lived with her, a juror guard, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn’t want to believe that everything has happened because he didn’t tell him that he was a single mother.
Monica entered yesterday the provincial prison of Palma, coming from the center of judicial detainees of Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "nor had any intention of causing harm to the minor."
Before, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has its eyes on the general elections because, whether progress is made or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles that it receives in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the regional elections of 2006, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend continues, which has been nourished by a shift of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would verify that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would stay with one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular ones can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their replacement at the head of the Diputació de Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popular agree on the possibility of the PSC losing the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it needs to get 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can take the lead in the Tarraconense capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has stood only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Commissariat of the Police in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, among them "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let 2008).
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Operation Kampai" has been "weakened" the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda at the international level and, "therefore, its operational capacity".
The investigators estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "combatants" can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence in the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the next few days will be carried out in EU territory similar coups developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), in Thailand another was developed with the capture of the Pakistanis Eh Kikanrj and Tahar Buttani.
These were the ones who directed the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly robbed tourists of passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
In the media of the investigation, it is emphasized that, at the moment, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized a lot of documentation.
The PP demands that More park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispense with pro-sovereignist adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the assurance that he has obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to make himself wanted, since the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the vote of investiture.
From a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are done in Catalan.
And as for the PP president, to support an investiture "we will have to park all the sovereignist and independentist speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated regional administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their caretaker killed more than 11 elderly
The heads of the geriatric hospital La Caritat of Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who, while he was there, killed at least eleven elderly men in his care.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible".
In addition to the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the caretaker, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims’ relatives are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then she has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the auto that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but, taking into account the age and the pathologies of the patients, the procedure was expedited by telephone.
La Caritat, through its director, yesterday strongly denied this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is not a single indication in the case that there has been reckless action by anyone other than the defendant himself."
The former "Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders and said the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by stabbing him with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime that he committed with the help of a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to medicines.
The insulin punctures and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the caretaker, not even to the number of murders confessed, which do not rule out that it is superior, and they justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say they are making themselves available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to yesterday’s threat from Trichet that warned “markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
Peripheral spreads have closed strongly and European banks’ shares have risen more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely picked up, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that, just as it collapses, recovers but motivated by the closing of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take a long time to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded to end the government debt purchase plan because it was ineffective and to eliminate all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future, leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue with their bond buying program and even signal to step up.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As in their May meeting where they said they hadn’t even contemplated buying bonds and markets collapsed, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday the one-year letter auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued $500 million at 5.28%, versus $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment following Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole figures have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and they have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease tensions ahead of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where a political commitment is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment ring in the ears of investors like Vivaldi’s four seasons.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key three-year bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for an Aid Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury have more than 40 billion in liquidity available triple that in March, at very expensive rates and closes you access to the markets sine die.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, it seems."
Courage, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm does not threaten the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "null and void", the judiciary of El Enebro next day 16, requested by five of its seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and get the management bodies of the owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services to the company does not seem willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
His board of directors was overruled by five of his seven sons who were appointed directors at the January 18th shareholders’ meeting this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The judiciary of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunder in the bosom of the Alvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the board.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate appeal from the applicants their five children to, through procedural cunning, clear fraud of Law and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null board of January 18", according to their official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for, once the meeting has been held, to proceed to its challenge by considering that it is "null and void".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, patrimonial company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge once the hearing on the challenge has taken place, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first nobody took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship everyone bet on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without devaluing the skill as a driver of the finally champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from the high competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computing instrument has been used to design assembly lines of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi planes and Nissan’s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement in “a few hours, almost in real time” the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and in trials.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the bolides.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all the elements of the Red Bull cars with the exception of the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its bolides in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret".
The workforce for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Formula 1 hero of Red Bull, without a doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drinks brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety zero.
The factory’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that advances in R&D in wagon cars accounted for 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds up to 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computers as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will make this initiative compatible with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom he has collaborated for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The also director of HP Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for installing the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, care, after-sales and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP’s computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects to a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell to 'steal' a million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for banks, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it anticipates a fall in interest margins, which will be compensated in part by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to attract one million private customers in three years, its pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch in 2011 a new master plan that will have a validity of three years.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share with the acquisition of one million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted-, its great pending subject, since until now it had pampered more SMEs and companies than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same thing, of austerity, with reduced costs as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks in these times dare to set goals and make them public since the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its Optima master plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made that it will expand one more year.
Customers who let the savings boxes leak will be your primary target.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult and momentous" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, while he believes that the liability war – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and cashiers are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity are already shifting to the price of credit to compensate for the drop in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it’s going to be a pressure factor on credit.”
"We haven't closed the tap, but the spreads are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave orders to his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads -see CincoDías of November 22 and 27-.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now “is to raise commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain "greater sizes will be required."
“Next year everything will move,” he said.
He claims that the capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out that any Spanish financial institution goes in red.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market in the raising of funds before new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it underestimated what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which dampens the crisis.
ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that there will be a wave of mergers of savings banks and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being executed.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been made, the addition of Cajasol to the Civic Banking group can not be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the great processes have already been done and supervised by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in that too," he said.
Speaking during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is being undertaken "as quickly as possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the deadlines that in his day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
“Going from 45 boxes with an average volume of assets of 28.5 billion to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that is unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who questioned it a "lack of knowledge".
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes as fast as possible".
He also recalled that Spanish banks came out very well of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or suppression of the 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without benefit, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Keep in mind that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of many of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, composed of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines for offending countries, possible suspensions of payments from some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defining itself for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government pulled out of its sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed needed to be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painstakingly extended the decision to rescue Greece.
Already then it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were very much against the bailout of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel emerges again with a clear position, demanding reform of the EU treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, albeit somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should assist in the process of reforming the Union that will make those measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we have to take action now with which he may not agree very much, from that date onwards the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which offending countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is telling us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, simply will not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we would do wrong not to understand it.
It is not just about bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand from us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater tranquility.
And that we take advantage of the window of opportunity that they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with the big companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the thesis that we must put order at home has opened its way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn there is, and it does not seem to be moving.
And, among the possibilities contemplated, the possibility of leaving a monetary area too crowded with less serious countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it has already warned us.
Sport and Law Fraud
Jokes like those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not willingness to escape a penalty.
The expulsion allegedly wrought by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behavior is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, with only a few minutes left to finish the match (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when it came to taking out fouls to provoke the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will end up as leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction in the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and will be able to pass clear of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and different amounts of money for the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate arose in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and which in past times has fined its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit fraud of law; for, indeed, they are actions respectful of the sport regulation, but they seem to elude its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that comprises the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods to which fair play is alluded is to prevent the team of the offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
Now, the paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as cheating or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely his action tried to be the most obvious to receive the punishment of the referee.
They awaited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is what kind of advantage infringers gain in the intentional misconducts examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that it is not placed in a disadvantageous situation to the opponent nor profit is obtained in the same game, because obviously the result of the action implies leaving the team itself with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that may threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of uncertainty, because the team can be eliminated at the first change, and also with this performance the players fulfill a penalty match and move on to the second card cycle, in which the suspension for card accumulation occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, from going through rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor making the most of what the rules allow.
In the case at hand, the players did not act to evade the enforcement of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without circumventing the punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between ingenuity and fraud is blurred, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, arises from two factors: because they were two self-expulsions and the way in which the transmission of the directive to provoke them took place.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture the Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The calendar dictatorship concentrates this year an avalanche of reserves for the 16th and 17th.
The celebrations self-supported by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, are proliferating.
Like the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year’s calendar (when New Year’s Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lean-cow stage began, many companies have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to dispense with the tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to predict how the festivities will be this month.
"People think about it long before booking."
"He wants to leave but he has the alerts on the issue of prices," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and remembers that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the range around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
A survey in several central establishments found the collapse of petitions for the night of 17.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the pretense of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
At AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, they remain optimistic after detecting a turnover boom since the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas menu, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green sprouts in some companies that re-invite their employees and feeling that the volume of groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, is confident to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that all the reservations are "animated", although the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
It is not a matter of having to pay for it, but of paying for it, it is a matter of having to pay for it.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises concern in U.S.
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at “a faster rate than any other country.”
WikiLeaks leaks confirm ties between Taliban and Pakistan
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Aside from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of U.S. diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for the unrest in Washington.
The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, said in a report prior to the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferating and reason to keep watch.
“Pakistan has had to hire people with strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The newest piece of documentation leaked by Julian Assange’s website is the growing decline in U.S.-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan’s high rate of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, calling communication with Pakistan “frustrating,” said: “Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are discarded.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also calls on Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make “very clear” to the official that “the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups.”
The Hunt for the WikiLeaks Boss
Obama appoints a senior counter-terrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and follow the movements” of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It’s not new, it’s dated November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
It was on the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
As things stand, all 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange “with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries do consider the so-called free-way notice network to proceed with an arrest — which must be made by the national police force — especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move has outraged Assange’s lawyers, who published a letter yesterday denouncing that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder has been willing to respond by videoconference to questions from Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s security chief.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal pursuit," the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son - Assange remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday, he granted an interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype from an undetermined location, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the U.N. in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign," he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s spokesman’s attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with views proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to intervene and its funds and prosecute anyone who gives them any contributions or aid.”
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying Assange should be “killed.”
“Obama should target it and use a drone or something.”
Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate, did not apologize.
“Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment,” he said.
It’s not like you’re going to have to do that.
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to overcome the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north by the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his disguise of resignation is insufficient for the likes of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can cause him the headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with nods that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councillors of ERC will be able to pronounce on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, and not by free hand.
If the carodistas want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that a "Bulgarian-style" result would also not be good.
Those close to Carod demand from the president something more than to make his office available to the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But not having the majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the document of strategic reorientation that the management will submit to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
Its intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for him promising to advance the congress to autumn 2011, something that the dome already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that “polyphony” hurts stability and that its goal is to make the organization able to wash dirty rags from doors inwards once and for all.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the acting councillor Josep Huguet signed in his blog.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the head of Innovació took for granted that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assemblyism as a working mechanism.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the holding of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the task of reviewing assemblyism in a specific congress of statute reform.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged facing the issue.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to resume it and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO Estado de México.
Among the murders are three women and the discovery of a pair of bodies cut off in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year there are 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases stands out the one of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the grace shot in the head in addition to the feet and hands tied with wire.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas street, in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
In the early hours of Thursday, four ejidatarios found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal gunshots to the chest, on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway, in the section that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was shot and killed after leaving his home to start garbage collection.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a bullet in the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the grace shot on the forehead was found the corpse of a man on a lonely road of the Colonia El Naranjo and under the body they found a cap percussed with a caliber 25 firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the blackwater channel of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán warned about the discovery of a corpse that was in the Peña Colorada area, which was tied with the hands back and with the head bandaged.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men was reported, who were wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda fractionation in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two death warning messages.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found dead in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning was located the body of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow blanket with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Rios according to a message that his executors left next to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunfire in the back of the head, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin were detected tattoos of the Holy Death, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the latter part of the month, the body of a man was found aboard a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet strikes and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a pair of men with their heads wrapped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said: “This happens to those who don’t align.”
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied hands and feet, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon ribbon and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of the Colonia Juárez.
Next to him the officers found a card with a message.
China maintains goals to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that he supports his offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its emission of greenhouse gases.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, China’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he said, in the last four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this matter.
He said China’s climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programs.
In all those areas, progress has been made, including the approval last year of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities, to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy efficient use and reduction of emissions.
In addition, several multi-annual plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, are in progress or have already been concluded.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficient Program, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent spotlights to savers and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific advisor on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he explained, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years and expects to do the same by 2020.
Clinging to the legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former Panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the legality and that the former Panist leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what is appropriate to his right.
In an interview before Gabino Cué Monteagudo took over as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission of Order of Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to go, if necessary, via complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Action National will be strengthened in the internal election of December 4 and 5, when his successor will be elected.
“That [an alliance in 2012] is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach for the local election that was successful and met the goal,” he said.
The Panist leader said that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and strengthen us," he said.
He said that the council will no doubt know how to choose the best or the best leader who requires National Action for the next three years, hence it will hand over the relay "to whomever the council determines."
"I have that absolute peace of mind and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the upturn that the party recorded in the last elections on July 4 will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it is not yet the time to think about 2012."
“For now it’s about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task.”
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are placed on them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations."
When asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech during the four years of his government, César Nava called on the PRI to reflect on the six-year-olds of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, let them start defending them, let them come out of the closet," he said.
He said that the head of the federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag nor much less censorship.
Obama promotes Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link to a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with senators, given that the legislation’s vote is imminent.
“With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation unless the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest of the bills.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
“We all agree that we need to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year.”
“I think we can get an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a “debate-closing vote” for the Dream Act, which would see the initiative to legalize undocumented students voted on Thursday in the Senate, though more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years and entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the bill, which is why they require a handful of Republicans to vote, at a time when supporters of the bill are lobbying hard to pass the bill.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act require to join several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their back on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have said they will not support it again.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of Language was a walk where participants showcased the storytelling
"That of El sexo en la lengua I understand but... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of Los placeres de la lengua, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to El sexo en la lengua).
The finger in the sore... "it puts us in a tight spot", the Argentine writer sweetly spit on the public, mostly young people, who gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "plaga" is, goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not get answers although she does get clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectious doctor she comes convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it's my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the aisle, but who clarifies that sore is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the sore is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "of the sore I only managed to know that it is the open real and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and the traps of the tongue must be very twisted.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a delightful narrative that he titled Elogio de la Invención, where the finger in the sore is not named but at a moment is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, an account of a famous sorceress, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to speak later America, the great novel that did not lack from the beginning its own chroniclers who told it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the story.
"Cervantes, who invented us all (the writers), mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise one would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination which was lacking to the point of shame."
However, he stressed "it is the madmen and the deceivers who best imagine" and it is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that the narrated belongs to one side or the other, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
He actually calls it the "Cervantine tradition."
“By her heritage we are what is counted.”
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero highlighted and applauded the variety of interpretations that resulted in the invitation of the FIL with its round table El dedo en la llaga.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed to the great plague of social violence that her country -and Latin America shares- is the product of drug trafficking and sales disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, after citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger on the wound of the writer committed to the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
“To be masters of our thinking and be masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance often means putting the finger on the sore and annoying those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and annoying also the powers that prefer a world in black and white,” he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Roman goes for his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting himself with the medal of the runner-up, has been one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he was in charge of Morelia with which he fell 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Clausura also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a 3-1 overall and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Devils, Rubén suffered a setback, as his team ended 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he took a 3-1 lead with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three players of his failed from the 11 steps and suffered the turnaround 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore he does not want to face the same fate, he seeks to let go of the spell and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any stats, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come to me, but the above is the most important thing," said the helmsman when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very current has the previous final, which, he says, has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were already prepared to run and I think that's a lesson, until the game ends we can celebrate."
To know that this series could be defined in penalty shootouts, something that does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we did not get a bad play the fate, sometimes it was because of the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in the final.
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up and try for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules for obtaining visas
Individuals will need to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time will be lower.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa will change at the U.S. Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, most applicants will need to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for petition visas (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken from the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in the latter for less time than in the past.
Similarly, those applying for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Finding of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency cited the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will unveil tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life.
The finding will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 13:00 at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," prompting speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that creatures exist alongside us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of them becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently it is a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that “there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know.”
The space agency will unveil the true scope of the findings at Thursday's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanship' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'throned' against the reform to the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it initiates ‘bipartisanship’, because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the coming days they will talk with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and with this the opposition coalition is over.
"So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that's what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, should now be “duopolitical.”
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipatidism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 lawmakers, and they are talking to other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress became a 'loot' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're splitting it between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked that the personality of the deputy be respected, that he be given his place at the negotiating tables.
"That not by cupular agreements, it is left out to 5 that we will probably make 9 deputies, now to the five that see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unify to seek a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for "the supplier"
Mazatlan City Council pays another check to the questioned owner of electric material company.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the company of electrical material, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200,000 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "clearance of accounts payable".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior State Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks remain to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“You haven’t bought anything, you’re just getting paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter, November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as indicated by the Law when a company is questioned by the ESA, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer said that they have not used its services again.
The above, after July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urge to attend tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to bad conditions of the Sanchez Taboada Glorieta in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and benches has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and take him back to nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to one day close a company and have no idea how much money is lost, or else they wouldn’t have done the works this way in such a long time and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because giving preventive maintenance and not only fall into the corrective," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadito de Mazatlan.
“Today, for tourists to come, it does not depend solely on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions,” he said.
"It has not been given due attention and this type of facts highlights something that is notorious for all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put online in conjunction with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
“Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be sorted first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory that we have to promote the destination.”
Requests IP results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A Legislature of dignified work and free of agreements between parties and the state Executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature has been installed, composed of seven political forces, 19 deputies from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergencia and one more from the PVEM, which totals a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies will really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival companions of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to bring forward the Governor in turn.
“We want them to come and do a dignified job and above all to be committed to society and the sectors because it was the Sinaloa people who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation.”
As for tourism activity, it demanded that the new legislators give it the weight that it bears within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretary.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity and generates currency and investment and that directly competes with agribusiness."
In addition, it is required to label resources to detonating tourism projects that help to give security to the state and in the update to the Alcohol Law that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
I'm looking for a magician
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For her parents, the next Day of Kings will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of no more and no less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the Salvador Allende colony and live day by day because the father does not have a fixed job.
“Sometimes we find it hard because my husband doesn’t have any shrimp, but we sell mandarin and potatoes... in the afternoon I go out with the people to sell to the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the children.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10, has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes sized for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster,' but I told him 'let's see son,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the campaign You are looking for a Magician King, donating a toy or cash at the reception of Northwest.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen chases were carried out as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment destined for production have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face allegations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have come after a long investigation that has lasted nearly a year.
“It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests,” Mr. Ruel said.
This police operation involved about seventy officers from the investigative module of Estrie de la Sécurité du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
Illegal Migration Can Be Fighted Without Problems
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should solve the problem of illegal migrants, is likely to face strong opposition as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely primarily on the Charter."
“I find myself here with a party that has created the granite you are standing on,” liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies, said after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow for up to a year’s detention of anyone from a vessel identified as transporting illegal immigrants, violates Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he could not support the bill because it targets the wrong target.
"We are against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government does," Duceppe said.
The NDP’s immigration critic, Olivia Chow, has dismissed criticism that her party is not firm enough on illegal immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree that measures should be taken against those in charge of the illegal pateras and that is what we aim for with another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservatives’ bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of a year,” Ms. Chow explains.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a quilt.”
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a confidence vote on its bill, which could lead to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has told the QMI Agency that the government will request a vote so that each deputy who is going to oppose will then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity
Although the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest had been announced, numerous observers continued to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday’s announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It must be said that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec held on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the Quebec party that treats the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of the cage" and as "a last-minute blundering solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over possible future unity.
“You will see the results when we announce it,” he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest is obstinate in avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the Comptroller General to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the auditor general," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent gang is not the only project under way in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request seems to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001 related to groups of motorcyclists, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa pushed for the passage of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses were evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters are also expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Given that these precipitations add to the snow melt that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, Quebec’s Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon to spill over.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have swept a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Center, meanwhile, issued announcements Wednesday communicating the strong floods of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
It's partly Dupont's fault.
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback before the Canadian Radio-television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding welfare and Haitians, as well as for his rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in the broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Council has also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not infringe the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision came after a complaint from the Common Front of People Receiving Social Welfare from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters should provide reliable data, not misleading ones.
In connection with the suicide, the present Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life ' s problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Any guilt has therefore been discarded in this regard.
The latest litigation concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been the protagonists of a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had made no donation to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure if the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
“My file has been clean for a year and a half,” the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the use of gross language.
In any case, the radio station CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of greatest hearing within three days.
A kung-fu king in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and Thai boxing, climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance the professional level.
“In my case, I look for fights everywhere because, for those who don’t enjoy playing on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security officer and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championships, held from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I’ve won in the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
“They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category.”
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009."
"The interesting thing is that I have progressed in every competition."
"At this stage, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to strike with fists and feet, as well as to throw opponents to the ground.
Clashes are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only keep one competition in his career, he will certainly attend the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
“This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China,” explains the friendly boy.
“It’s like the equivalent of the Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).”
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has won his first match, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“The one who has won me is a real professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face each other in the final of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a previous tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gestion, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Énergie gestion consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause prices to rise.
“This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition.”
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," Quebec Party deputy Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there had been any collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" and "lack of rigour."
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any event, the contract was awarded without competition; it was a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the consortium formula in the technical advisory sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick look at Quebec’s trade register allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, namely Dessau.
Regarding the Énergie gestion consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to a particular labor dynamic and Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically to it since the 1970s."
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
“If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher.”
“You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and at a good price.”
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people," Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gestion consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Énergie gestion.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Énergie gestion contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has hinted that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Quebec Liberal Party."
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is more about its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
Quebec consumers barely rely on sustainable development actors, fair trade brands and ecological certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumption are plentiful, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this even slows their commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates bearing the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "ecorresponsible", the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians’ speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, which is currently supported by about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of the information cause 46% of consumers to discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of the supposed yields of the ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, the Barometer notes.
Greener and more responsible (the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 points out of a maximum of one hundred this year), Quebec’s Homo consumus loves to take the place of the king of recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be out of doors: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they used public transport or shared cars to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, who were expecting a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois’s eXcentris cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and return him to his true cinematic vocation, have not gotten what they were asking for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected grant, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would, in fact, be less than the initial expectations; this could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a $12.8 million request last spring, but applications have since been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who leads the eXcentris file, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a final report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a donation from the State must be completely discarded.
Recall that the Association of Cinema and Film Complex Owners of Quebec opposed direct state investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector do ask for considerable financial assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of it, has carried for ten years the burden of the cinema of author in its premises of the complex, after financing its own construction, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
Angus and Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are launching a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to screen films at eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, screening Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of complex Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadians’ complex with respect to the Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter’s sense of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, that is, during the federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This surprised the U.S. ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations about this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex virtually inherent in Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Accordingly, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this choice: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to speak of.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“Of course, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting.”
This sense of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, whereby Canada will for the first time run a deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion,” writes Mr. Breese.
No mention is made that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image broadcast by the drama series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the kidnappings for the CIA to conduct vigorous interrogations.
Another cable says that, during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to host some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that it depended “on each case.”
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "has delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits have warmed in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on CBC radio that the person responsible for this mass leak should be “murdered.”
In the United States they echo Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, even better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the global car fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that amount should still be decreased to stabilize, before 2020, the rise in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from spiraling out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of compact fluorescent light bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced even more.
Compact fluorescent light bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above all, they contain no mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent compact light bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not compact fluorescent light bulbs, but coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted with incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the benefits that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast, given that the deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,” a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“Calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed Wednesday's deadline to pass at midnight without the results being published, three days after Sunday's scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had commented to television that the commission "continued working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, demands for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara multiplied around the world.
However, Gbagbo’s side counts on the Constitutional Council’s annulment of the “fraudulent” votes in the north, in the hands of the former New Forces (NF) rebellion since the failed September 2002 coup d’état.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager for the president of Ivory Coast, has said that the intimidation of voters carried out by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo’s complaints.
However, Gbagbo’s opponents consider that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has deemed “unacceptable” the delay in the publication of the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have set the stage for the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on mainland territory (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by the INSEE.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population in mainland territory and 9.7% with the DOM.
In a year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not they are available within two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with the unemployment rate rising again to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed according to the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with the DOM.
There has only been a stability of unemployment among people aged between 25 and 49 years, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
The INSEE has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini Investigated and Detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, manager of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is under investigation and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, influence-trading and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions asked by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and imprisoned one of their close associates, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done is take care of the landfills he has to manage.
As for the allocation of the contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to counsel Simon.
As part of this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, is also being investigated since Wednesday, for embezzlement of funds and complicity, but he has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been blamed on him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken into account the explanations and has released him," his lawyer, Yann Arnoux, said in a statement.
Four other people were interrogated late on Tuesday and released under judicial control in the case of two of them, deputy prosecutor Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been charged with “smuggling influence and passive corruption”.
Two officials from the Agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "theft and misappropriation of public goods by a person dedicated to the public service" and for "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “covering up social property abuse.”
Among those who have faced Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect their societies have served to launder the capital of big banditry.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several court orders initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations focus especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: Elysee has exaggerated Syria mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French investigator detained in Iran for "espionage", has kept the public in French vile, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee has explained its strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice on managing their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman did not come in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency attempted to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram drawn up on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage-taking cases".
The Elysee adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
Explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly detained in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continuously release” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate release.”
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often.”
Because, once attempts at negotiation by discreet channels are exhausted, “silence will solve nothing,” the Iranians are “experts in delaying maneuvers.”
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is “a common Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will occur on August 16, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of reward).
In addition, he notes that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could “in the near future detain another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after twelve days, but is blockaded in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is being requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge ' s decision.
The U.S. embassy, like numerous observers, doubts this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iran’s clandestine procurement networks for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Freeing the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guarantees that it was not so.
Elisha, he says, has not only "been greatly surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot overturn the decision" judicial, he says.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of French intelligence services.
The Elysee adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in some buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy.”
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee spares no effort, uses press releases and organized “leaks” in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an “important” and “influential” role of “mediator”.
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and prove that the manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions “the media blitz of French officials.”
What is the reason for such “gratitude” to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done.”
The document then discusses the reasons that have led Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The major communication effort “is aimed at validating Sarkozy’s policy of openness to Syria,” he said.
A policy begun in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been labeled premature and unmerited".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris is trying to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we thanked him."
“At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received her at the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having played an "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot".
From midnight onwards, young Koreans cannot play online
The South Korean government will pass a “Cinderella” law that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gambling companies to block access to such games after midnight to young people under the age of 16, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study in school and lead a normal life during the day."
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, a ministerial official in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of the young people request it, the official added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow you to limit the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced a further 58 countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host countries
Amid the storm of corruption suspicions, FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday appointed the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can come to take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), following a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue with its implementation in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World Cup.
Transactions behind the scenes, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not weigh too much for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of their country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the bonfire Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has highlighted three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to displease FIFA and embarrass British officials, who have thrown themselves into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The head of government hopes to replay the successful coup given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had won in 2005 for London the organization of the 2012 Olympics.
Will this intense activity be enough to regain the brilliance of England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World Cup of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the gloomy economic and financial outlook of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
Possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they get is to give points to Russia, which has become a major outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“They are bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to be the most logical favorite.
As the world’s leading economic powerhouse and home to FIFA’s top sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the grant of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Alongside Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by weak TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had doubted.
Mitterrand had hinted that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had not the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One commandment in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not combine well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it is always necessary to appear to doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the deputies of the UMP, on Tuesday night in the Elysee, the possibility of "two mandates" has provoked some uproar.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not at all.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
I was simply relaying the facts, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has talked about the presidential elections, with a joking tone, in meetings of this type.
"In the worst, or better, case, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me," he released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't think about what's to come next."
His statements before yesterday do not bring him any closer to the candidacy, nor less.
There are comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has risen to the palestra that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Rather on the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to demand that the battle be organized earlier than planned.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the issue," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and prudently.
"If he thinks he can lose, he will not be a candidate," Raffarin said.
"He will always think he can win," said Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is forced to keep its acquisitions of State Letters
The latest meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that are expected to end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation in the European bond markets today.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in favour of solving the debt crisis of European states.
He did not want to say whether he felt the central bank should do more, such as increasing its program to buy government bonds.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans"...
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent in terms of his intentions, only indicating that the program of buying State Letters in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese bonds again.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion in securities since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that purchases will continue (see page 29).
Economists also do not anticipate any significant changes in course.
Although lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity on beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
“I don’t think he’s going to significantly change his program.”
“Otherwise, it would risk further tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
- Oppenheim.
Regarding interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of such bonds in order for the market to remain stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the yields paid by the most fragile states," said a senior bond manager.
Because, if interest rates are put in the clouds, States will have even more trouble reducing their indebtedness, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government heads the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "undecipherable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of the hedge contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing a certain uproar in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was over 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, their problem is the lack of growth and the associated income stagnation, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have provided a jug of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the government deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions could be applied after the holidays, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be adopted," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short term or in the long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries," said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
There remains the problem of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, an unfavourable period would be opened for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans Reflect on Strengthening Mechanisms to Fight the Crisis
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris: “I think we have already shown on Sunday, at night and by day, that Europeans are clearly solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone.”
Although it was relative, the easing seen yesterday in the rates of the obligations of the European States has boosted the governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower the rating of Portugal's debt, the most frequent target in current speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which significantly weighs on banking systems," say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets.”
Aware of this gap and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the mechanisms for exiting the crisis that already exist.
Informal consultations between finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the collimator of markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in the Far East about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly paves the way.
The first issues of EFSF bonds are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the frontline countries, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to the austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path than Greece and Ireland did.
They both want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms that they consider indispensable for building confidence on a lasting basis.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, finally, consider the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the public bond markets.
On November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-draw the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a front-line player in the European public debt market, believe an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be enough, “preferably” in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
There is an instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, currently endowed with EUR 60 billion.
A council that could undoubtedly be examined in detail by the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfalls continue to cause circulation difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, 24 departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen since Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects the north of the Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Basse-Normandie, <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is strong enough to cause circulation difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads for heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles, has been prohibited.
According to the gendarmes, the traffic in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that you do not drive except in case of need and the circulation of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transport has been banned in Picardy.
No specific measures were planned for Wednesday night to limit the circulation of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25 percent of their flights at Paris’ Roissy airport and 10 percent at Orly on Thursday because of expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro du Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France has reached its peak, billions have been raining.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the subway of the Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4 billion euros.
On the theoretical level, this sum will be the one that will subsequently allow the GSP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 amending finance law, reviewed by the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the devices planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the tax on offices in the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's far from 4 billion.
"Fiscal resources are required in addition to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of funds allocated by the State and to be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," the statement read.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
“From the moment income is created, we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the $4 billion later, as we explained.”
"It will be recorded in the budget and used as needed."
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4 billion is not listed in the credit, can provoke a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on 7 December.
Avenger hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” US revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Gaddafi’s sinisterly ridiculous profile has long given cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for novelties about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occult not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The whistleblower is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little anxiety) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, what do I know, editor of Libération), who considers only what he can recognize to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sending the U.S. embassy from Rome to the State Department was the same that Newsweek published the week before.
So why have the revelations of these records caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every educated person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since the Second World War and since the Heads of States can call each other by phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have been transformed into espionage centers.
Any viewer who watches research films knows it perfectly well, we just pretend that we don’t know it by hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker could consult the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country greatly affects the State Department’s prestige.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the " executioners ".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in the time of Orwell, he could be conceived at all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer even keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put on the net any confidential information, since it would be like publishing it on a poster in the middle of the street.
But it’s also clear that, with today’s technologies, you can’t expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is a science fiction thing and, therefore, novelistic, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by heart or, at most, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a telegraph with (telephone) wires.
Videotapes (analog) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, uncovering all the secrets of montage, while now CDs (digital) only allow to move forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, to enormous proportions.
With the high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the commutes that it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was being secretly plotted in embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s hustle and bustle in its funding pledges
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the fast-start or early-start pledges made by developed countries have been met.
And the French chapuces have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation turned out to be appreciable and was appreciated for what it really is: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be “new and additional” to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Nowadays, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and $150 million is added in three years in terms of fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditures of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of France’s aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while claiming to respect its commitment to “new and additional” funds.
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no norm and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that every euro borrowed is equivalent to a donated euro.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to one euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan for the country that grants the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France does not find such a reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document for your own eyes.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
It's a good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to give the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional", as it had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other Member States going to continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in negotiations, since the developing countries are not fools...
The chapter on early financing is a relatively short-term detail of the climate negotiations as a whole.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could push forward the debates on the stakes at stake in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter that is currently being debated): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of computing loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France’s fast start and its vision of “additional character” and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to move the negotiations forward.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value given the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the food that a child of about ten years consumes in four meals and one snack a day.
These model meals, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three parts of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances susceptible to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"While in virtually all cases the legal limits for each chemical are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is of concern," the association said.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil as a school snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses found the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the slice of salmon was the most “nutritive” with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk these “contaminant cocktails” generate for the consumer “is likely to be underestimated,” the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
