The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange restored its losses.
CEZ share transactions have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the collapse of the day before it was nearly 6%.
Behind this decline is the collapse of stocks on Wall Street.
Thus, also from us, there is a reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector.
Collapse of stocks in Asia
Asian stocks on Tuesday experienced a dramatic plunge, although the indices, however, subsequently cancelled some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange cleared almost 4% during the day, but later also part of the losses stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange were down more than 5 percent, but losses eventually hovered at 4.3 percent.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell 3.6%.
“The planning of the bailout action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world,” noted the head of Hong Kong’s Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy on its own, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also suffer the consequences.
Massacre of American stocks
The U.S. Parliament on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, for which $700 billion (almost 12 trillion CZK) was to be allocated.
Lawmakers thus ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday suffered a carnage and major stock indices experienced their biggest crash in more than two decades.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly 7% and a similarly sized crash was last seen in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has given in: the U.S. government can give $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will take place at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on approving the bailout in the form of economic aid to the U.S. financial system for a total of $700 million (almost twelve trillion crowns).
But it is not yet said.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, the chairman of the chamber’s banking and financial services committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
In the Senate, according to some sources, you could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, to reach the aid of the markets.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
“We have taken a big step forward.”
"We have clarified our differing views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilization package," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
The final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Legislators’ delegates met late Saturday and Sunday with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to finalize the government’s financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead to serious losses for financial companies and jeopardize the stability of the entire system.
"We are completing the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market."
“We still need to move forward with the recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis is falling heavily on stock markets that are collapsing sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are thus trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
That is, they want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of Congress.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two Houses of Congress will vote on the law and even if negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some issue.
Legislators hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount foreseen for the support of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be made available as soon as possible as President George Bush has called for.
But Congress can block the rest of the money if it feels like the program is not doing its job, blocking the next $100 billion and the next $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may override his right of veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, namely to get the finances to buy the passive mortgage securities, the price of which has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
“We have elaborated everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the Sunday law and the Senate on Monday," as the Republican senator mentioned.
The progress in the negotiations is also welcomed by US President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s positive performance and appreciated “the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of gold parachutes
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, the top spokesman, said lawmakers had agreed on responsibility for the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the budget of reductions, splitting the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called golden parachutes for executives of companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard and we’ve made a big step towards the deal that will work and be beneficial to the market and also to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan relies on help to homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage installments it will buy with the goal of lowering monthly installment expenses for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
“And that’s because we don’t know how and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will determine how the financial sector and government will split the losses between them," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
“Much more important is that as early as this week congressional representatives agree on supporting this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this time more important," Marek stressed.
Duel to the last blood: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will recommend how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
However, there are many reasons why you should get a self-contained reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this there is not even an objective reason.
However, if hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls are crowded on your shelves, you probably dream of such a turntable at least.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also the price and quality categories here.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns for a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan perhaps hardly digests the twenty crowns headphones of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It is the battery life that decides.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read music, but they don’t do it by mistake.
There is no other device as universal as the mobile phone.
Alongside the primary functions, calling and texting, it can read music and video, record both and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe even surf.
And if we consider smartphones and handhelds you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle since no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone and the sooner the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap mobile phones, don’t count on them to last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get at work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charge.
An additional problem exists when you download music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have the universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Certainly music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without an adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
The readers, except for a few exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players create themselves a media library sorted by the names of the performers, album name, genre, or user classification.
Some devices reproduce only the tree structure of the folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, pay particular attention to battery endurance, memory capacity, quality and the type of audio outputs, and clearly to ease of use.
If you need the music above all as a background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you just need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This is now possible, clearly on any mobile phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about which formats the mobile phone or the reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to them will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular ones, the majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument for buying a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is poor and is usually limited only to hits of the moment of the radio.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their phones behind them.
For anyone who wants to listen to something, scour your pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, whether you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every mobile phone, but only a small part of MP3 players has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for common headphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones and also with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15,000 crowns.
Instead, the advantage of the readers is, in addition to others, the easy handling.
The simplest ones are not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) anyone can really handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally colliding with the start-up of the mobile internet network and consequently a giant bill for data transmission.
Which device to take
Even cheaper phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an interchangeable memory card slot (such as M2, microSD, etc.).
As far as the purchase of the respective card is concerned, you also fall within the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful
The basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can do it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and also want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you should not spend more than 1100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, prefer the specialized phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service so it comes close to the same MP3 player.
In this area has made more way Sony Ericsson, which phones of the walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the brands listed above provide you with the same service and the same price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (commonly 15 hours, usually up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Possibly
Perhaps the mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing here – a virtual trader forcing traditional traders to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
Of the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end, <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> also confirmed this, noting that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the European Commission's final steps in the field of regularising roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really like to start the clash.
Maybe it sounds absurd, but here we have three mobile networks and coverage that is well above 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense he also often emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network probably no longer has many possibilities. (In fact, perhaps it would be difficult to find other frequencies by now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators that has led to a significant drop in prices, to which traditional operators should have reacted.
At the same time, even before sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar voices resounded in Britain.
It has been shown, however, that the place for such operators is there and that they can be really successful.
After all, we do not have to go very far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator has managed to conquer more than 100,000 customers and to become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta to which in the Czech Republic belongs among other things U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be able to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry with them, that is, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the more restricted service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that cost at least half as much as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a pretty good move even betting on a group-target not little.
This operator focuses, so to speak, specifically on men.
"Real men choose Mobilking operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company who produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can say a similar concept as in Poland.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators rely.
In addition, from a service point of view, it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there ever will be an operator in the Czech Republic, Mobilking will not be.
"There is talk of expanding this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have many expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will take place rather in the other countries in our area," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, press spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone conversation with Mobile.cz.
Thus it indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this thought.
Rather, they try to do everything so that no potential competitors are created.
For some time now it has not hidden its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunication.
And the sooner you do, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to make progress in negotiations with some of them," says Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will probably have to be by the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation stands an impenetrable wall of silence.
“Right now we don’t believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the press section of Telef<0xC3><0xB2>nika O2 mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also used by other operators.
T-Mobil press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: “For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build.”
He adds: “A virtual operator is unlikely to appear on the T-Mobil network by the end of the year.
At this point we should have already had a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon.”
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on achieving its 3G license requests.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most productive.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Competent authorities - with complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances surrounding the creation of U:fon testify that when operators care about something they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure pressed against <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly accessible information from <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for which the virtual operator is not accepted.
Martina Kemrová commented: “The competitive environment in the mobile market has recently been further enhanced with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Regarding the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on him and especially on his services.
However, the attitude of mobile operators is surprising because of the complete lack of interest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not just about the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, with respect to the whole problem, has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been attractive enough for traditional traders," Kristián Chalupa, from the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS external relations section, said in the answer to our question.
Such a formulated statement by the representatives of the operators is perhaps not surprising.
Instead of the office that has to defend the interests of consumers and, above all, take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of its position in the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: “Overseas where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the lower prices for mobile services.”
But obviously the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence arises on its own.
Just as the identical price of gasoline for all gas stations is without a doubt the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
“The section has found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No trader has a dominant position, so it has no corresponding greater responsibility for its behavior in the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be lacking for the telecoms regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many controversial points.
Of course, there is <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s analysis of the relevant markets, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has – logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant necessarily.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators proceed in such an oddly similar way.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all traders they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS keeps itself out of the whole affair.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the update of the recently approved telecommunications law, despite the fact that, from this, many experts expected the improvement of the situation.
This fact the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
It can be done, when no one looks
While without us noticing it remains the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are even some in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually the companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the pre-established people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company faces the operator as a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar pre-sale.
"If the cases you are talking about, which we will be interested in, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and it could lead to the conclusion of the cooperation with that company," Kemrová said.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself at the same time from such an attitude.
That is to say, they derive a profit from the activity of these companies and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not harmed in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the regular customers of mobile operators.
But that should be a strange minimum for <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another issue opens up for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want to it will not have to settle for the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be more expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where the operators were born, the traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - market too small, at the limit too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
In developed countries, however, it is precisely in these cases that the regulatory bodies have intervened to defend not the mobile operators but their customers.
Both with the formal measures and with the non-formal pressure, then came the creation of the first virtual operator and he was joined by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators throw the whole case from one to the other like a boiling potato.
From our experience we can not get rid of the feeling that the unclearness of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not throw out the sponge.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator will appear really soon with us, the Czech mobile market will get back on track.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only <0xC3><0x9A>OHS could hardly remain impassive to the refusal (discrimination) of the other concerned.
And maybe we'll stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of the Recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female vocals, chorus pitch and instrumental edition.
The singing is under the direction of Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn revisions are Otakar Jeremia<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already before he told the radio "<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas" that he chose specifically to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
“From the beginning I tried to make sure that both, and the choir, have a clear diction, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony,” he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j" was first played in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original opera Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The MHD Wednesday in Prague will also accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers on the subway, tram and bus will get in the place of the paper ticket will have an electronic card in their pockets.
At the moment, it can be obtained by about one hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can purchase the 30- and 90-day annual ticket (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged at the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Rozkaly, Let<0xC5><0x8D>s, Lubylisy, Raj, Kobylisys, Ka<0xC5><0x88>any.
The coupons can be purchased from yesterday on the internet on the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who start using the internet service can completely forget the counters at the metro stops where until now they had to make long lines for paper tickets.
The coupon can be purchased via the internet and on the Opencard it is recharged at one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
“Passengers at these locations have a ticket office with trained staff that will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also record on their card the credit acquired,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, it will be possible to upload the electronic coupons on the Opencard in ATMs and self-service that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, resemble ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are now five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty,” Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The coupon will be checked by the driver instead of the ATM.
The ATM service that will operate from tomorrow is very simple.
Simply insert the Opencard card and upon payment of the coupon, it will be charged on it.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is to say in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added in the integrated transport in Prague there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they check the time and zone validity," explained the Filip ticket checking mode by the organization Ropid, which sets up the schedules of the collective transport in Prague.
The city buses have card readers integrated in the driver’s box.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but in addition you have to place the Opencard at the determined point next to the chest.
Thus the driver checks the validity of the vouchers charged.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers uploaded, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this kind of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the coupon expires, can again go to the self-service ATMs, where the coupons are loaded on the card.
Information on the validity of their documents will be displayed here on the device screen.
The Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the US
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include <0xC5><0xA0>umava to the United States.
This results from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, it is said, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This is furthermore the result of the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow again the return of the "Schumava district" - occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We understand the situation and want to be sure of the promises that American units will come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “The people who care about the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava with all their heart.”
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Sudeten Germans only hope of brutality, lack of respect, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter beg the American president to take over the protectorate over <0xC5><0xA0>umava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, which oppresses and uproots ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing, nothing at all, to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge on the part of the “Czech oppressors”.
If the president of the United States were to doubt the conviction of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would be enough to organize in the district a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem na<0xC3><0xAF>ve with our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to intuit at least that it would be their displacement from the republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility altogether.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten peoples.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was mobilized during the war as Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice's German in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp at Hol<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him for him to teach him Czech.
"These believed that once they got home the Czech would be comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, relied on the fact that on the basis of the decrees of Bene<0xC5><0xA1> they would be moved from the Republic.
You don't think - you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, one could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek, expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put on his belt before he leaves.
It wants to touch in the conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
What will appear in the commercials?
Especially stories of people that will affect emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the slogan "bloody" of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his life.
The commercials will "scare" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic scenes of accident victims.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
Carrot and stick to drivers
“With drivers, the carrot and stick system works.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass through the red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or the accident.
The risk must be remembered to drivers," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transportation Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án of the hospital Na Homolce.
And so it takes information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of the danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed warning panel has been installed, it will probably soon become confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Ko<0xC5><0x99>án.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published Monday, the daily Jediot Achronot.
“We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but we will have to leave the same percentage to the Palestinians (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would also include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want to be hit by the rockets or the flatteners, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the allusion to the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the premier it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historical places," which lie within the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he added.
The retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert has also spoken out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is the prerequisite for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“I am not proposing the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan,” he said.
“The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up the permanent support they offer to Hamas (the Shiite movement) terrorism, al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq,” he said.
Questions after the accident: Are bus stewards illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you can not walk on the bus that makes long distance routes
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus of the company Student Agency came up the question if stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
Last week’s accident in which a 22-year-old stewardess was killed was caused by a truck that cut off the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at the least safe place on the bus, despite the fact that there were still two other seats allocated.
But the bus can crash or brake abruptly even when distributing coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the driving licence.
If not approved, passengers must be seated.
Student Agency buses have no standing places, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura director confirmed to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x95>.cz.
“We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned seat," he expressed his point of view.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role.”
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The road traffic law only recognizes the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds less clearly spokesperson Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the law cures this problem enough.
It depends on whether the bus has approved standing seats.
It's all here," he says.
Categorizes buses in urban where there are standing places and maximum speed limited, intercity with standing places with higher maximum speed and long distance without the standing places with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, the expert says.
The BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of the stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet ride there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to service on planes.
Even there it is not safe when turbulence comes and the flight attendant can crash his head.”
“If the bus brakes abruptly, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Same as in the city bus or on the tram.
The transport company must solve the safety of the stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of stewards.
This one takes about two hundred.
The director even after the accident considers their job dangerous.
“As soon as I have the feeling that I have to consider the steward’s profession as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they climb up.
It would also reduce expenses," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency, motivated the absence of the stewards on his vehicles as an interest in security.
"We have no hostess, we oppose from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," said less than a year ago T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz.
An immense tragedy has happened.
In the accident of the line to Naples, a young hostess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who had worked for the company for two years, died.
A Slovenian truck probably exited the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid it with a sharp maneuver, but hit it with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewarts had been occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these seats in long-distance buses, they are unstoppable."
The company intends to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transportation has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarification of the movement of the stewarts on board the buses.
“They have not achieved any concrete results.
Buses don’t consider them so much, they deal more with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone while driving,” says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewarts as a major threat to the safety of passengers," said Havelka, who said that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and safety offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf point to Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the director of the WestLB to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the center of the capital market of the financial group of the savings banks" through the meeting of units of the bank of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch “a competent block” with lasting profits in such a venture.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive impetus for further linkages in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is how it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the distressed WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only from the EU commission, but also through the National Authority for Financial Supervision, having pointed out a long time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in search of a future solution.
The links between Deka-Bank, which the clients of the Savings Banks themselves already know because of their investment funds, and the WestLB have certainly been talked about for quite some time, including by Frankfurt.
In late August, Deka-Bank chief Franz Waas said at the time of the first half of the year's turnover presentation that a merger of the house on Mainz Street with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
But Deka's board of directors, which is half carried by regional banks and consortia of savings banks, delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint bargaining.
It could be market trades or parts of them.
The conversations, however, have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important companies in Frankfurt, not the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003, for a short period, it appeared that Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
Of this association of three nothing was done.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Hesse opposed the participation of the Helaba.
The remaining two institutions also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate instead went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have often thought about a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end Günther Merl, chairman of the board of Helaba, spoke out against design games to reunite with his house.
Aside from this, it seems that cognition is created, that it is necessary to bring the different houses of the public sector closer together.
As the Bavarian Parliament election has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with Baden-Württemberg may first take place.
This is not good news for Helaba at all.
If pressure increases for further mergers, partners will be missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than homes in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringia Savings Bank Association, which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, has locked the meeting with the WestLB.
It's just the NordLB.
These geo-strategic reasonings are just one account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual homes fit together.
In June Merl pointed out that to the decisive question of which business model the future of the regional banks would be secured, there would still be no answer from the association of German savings banks.
In the end, the division of West LB could also come out, which on the part of that of course is not desired.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l barrel of the Kaiser brand stands a massive beard and shows to the about 200 travelers what deep tones it can produce from the throat.
Elena first gives a kiss to Luca and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking lot next to the Porta Nuova station, four couriers depart this evening at 11:45 p.m. with destination Monaco, "Festival of the Beer", expected arrival at 6:30 p.m.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It’s so noisy, Marco says, that it’s not for Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat with a faux fur lining and a pair of glasses with large silver stripes belong to the buses.
Since 5 years they go to the Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
The departure at night, during the day to the party, return at 22.30.
Staying overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The cost of 45 Euros includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with Kaiser beer, made according to Bavarian rules of authenticity, the health insurance and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly silence falls on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better yet, they will still need their strength.
They stop at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates on the A9 motorway before Munich make a short break.
When, as expected, Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others group together, and Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When they open the doors of the beer tent, it means running!”, quotes Marco from early morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps sitting on the same benches, divide in the adjoining space!"
The jar costs 8,25 Euros, yells Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Prove to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!"
Third: "Tonight at 10:30 pm we meet again here! Do you understand?"
Already leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as you follow the yellow caps away to trees, road signs and even a billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as the "Italian Weekend".
Exact data do not exist, there are 50,000, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police of Munich is reinforced with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic on nationalities, where Italians are in first place with 200 medical treatments in front of the British (about 60 medical treatments) and Austrians (about 80).
Above all loved by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, finance minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned, that the German banking sector is not spared from the critical developments.
Because the crisis started over the weekend.
The real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a billion-dollar loan, in order to protect itself from turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loans would reach up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the requested part.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
After all, there are the losses of the affiliate Depfa.
The state funder according to a newspaper article has refinanced himself in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008 the bank’s reserves had fallen by 95% to 2.37 million Euros, the share of equity also fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs had fallen to 0 compared to last year, earnings from both increases in demand and certain shares as well as the liquidation of loan provisions fell by more than 70% on 5 million Euros.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the restitution of subordinated compensation costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the reimbursement of interest under the single text of the tax laws and the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was found to be quite moderate at about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 had lost himself in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were dismembered into Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classic state financing was too low, Depfa has engaged more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group’s profit and loss account.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
In 2007 they were reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the acquisition of Depfa is a major funder of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market among banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have client fiduciary deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the lending between banks has largely dried up, because the banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually requires a part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – about 50 billion. – short-term refinancing means.
According to the notice of Hypo Real Estate the financial needs of the group were covered by credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of the international money markets mostly not functioning.
From other sources it is heard, that thanks to the money the refinancing is insured until the end of 2009.
HRE Steering Committee Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE group will not need money markets in the near future.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) rely on the fact that the marketability of the HRE Group is still assured.
This is hoped for by the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
The funding may not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After the bank on Sunday night was on the verge of bankruptcy, the momentary rescue failed to calm the spirits.
The stock price fell by 75% on 3.30 Euros.
They handle mortgage courses pretty well.
While the debts of the previous grade show themselves almost immovable, they give up the rates of the credits postponed.
The mortgages of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo are mainly affected, understandably the accruals with maturity beyond 2009.
Before the HRE loans seemed an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, that with the relief of the Depfa the crisis has taken hold, must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the less damaged central banks, governments, and banks are still ready, you can count on a depreciation of your annuities by the deadline.
Or it goes into operation, which no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But with information overturned because of partial statistications, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will especially create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to split from their commitments.
Short-term investors can bring to a conclusion the carry-over of losses for future payments of the capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to show up at Tachibana Highschool on her first day of school, the girls start laughing: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log she tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had a fifa to go to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road on my own and fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the first lesson hour does not seem to have been fixed as we did in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive slowly from 8 onwards, until at 8:40 a brief interview with the professor begins, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson began, it was up to me to introduce myself.
In the meantime, I'm not the guy who speaks in front of people, more in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I put on an old mother-in-law skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I put myself in front of the chair and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate in a week my birthday.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, laughed and waved and I continually heard the word "Kawaii."
I knew this from my mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "cute, sweet".
Then I quickly ran into my place.
The girl next to me smiled, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson had continued quietly, but when she played the gong, I was assaulted in the truest sense of the word.
They all talked messy and laughed and teased me with questions – then it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break everyone opened their Benedict.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket – it’s different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu..
I don’t even know exactly what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except for the plums put in salt, brrr!
Bentoes are not just Japanese school lunches.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives away a Bento made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then to meet the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my manga comics.
I'm really curious, if I can find out.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year in Japan.
I've always said,
"Because I'm fascinated"
I have been reading the manga for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started learning a bit of the Japanese language.
I was completely convinced that I would come once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care a lot about us here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends – on the opposite side: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen in my life.”
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or a cockroach runs away when they feel danger. Does that mean they also feel fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: even many animals have feelings.
4. But how could we verify if, when they behave in the same way as us, they have the same feelings as us?
In the Internet journal "Edge" for some years are published articles of well-known scientists.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else so far having been able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope, that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to the other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter into impractical territory, because the reference base does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do. That is, it pretends to be dead, runs away or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to convey our feelings towards animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human awareness, the associated circuits (this for its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus admit the foundation on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should arise in the way man speaks: since a large part of life is related to language, it is often said to be related to consciousness.
In this case, the animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the animal’s awareness, as it is done, surely differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to discover how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through one's own experience because of the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would be easier to access.
One could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies of primate short memory, particularly in the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, we move first to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for visualization implementation.
So what is outlined for feelings?
I impute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
Thus, the feelings are closely related to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and in particular the human being.
Speaking nature creates subtle nuances of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
In this respect Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that the feelings result from more primitive activities of the body regions of the cortex and the paleocephalic sensations, similar to Jack Pankseep, who has however focused more on the paleocephalic.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict it, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and humans to be fear is likely to be felt with the senses in both cases: but how could it be, if rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
Does a cockroach in danger run away as if he too felt fear?
In my eyes the mere resemblance of behavior cannot yet show any vital resemblance.
And that is, neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have paleoencephalics similar, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephalon responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to humans: how would you want to prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at the neural level, provided that the same procedure is renounced on rats and men.
Just as I don’t do research on language and consciousness in rats, I don’t do research on their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward rather than continually bump into a wall.
I am a practical emotional.
UEFA President Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise European matches with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
Both host countries limp in the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of European stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to work with the maximum speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association, Grigory Surkis.
"We're going to keep an eye on the U.S."
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the management of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Numerous members of the first division only in the last season were convicted of manipulation, in the end they even had to postpone the start of the League at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid is outraged.
He wanted to promote a new film, in the interview he talked about the private and now has problems with the ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan declared adultery her ex Dennis Quaid.
He foams with anger and replies.
Delayed Roses War for ex-married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now arguing with each other in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the marriage's failure: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayals she would have known only after the separation.
The occasion for the "soul strip" was working with the press of Ryan for her new film "The Women" – it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to being publicly declared an adulterous husband was clear: it would be “unheard of,” the 54-year-old told the “New York Daily News,” that “Meg for the umpteenth time repeats and reworks the history of our relationship.”
It would also be "deplorable" for Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, to again "be publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is married again and will soon become the father of twins.
And so his judgments end with the arrow: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself fortunate to have a wonderful family that does everything for the better."
Lower prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and hotel nights have again become more affordable - this is the result of a study of the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after a rise in prices in the first quarter saw a noticeable decline in the second quarter.
After prices in the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed, averaging around 6.9 compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the reason for this as the weak price of the dollar, which would have led to a "declining desire to travel of American tourists"
Financial centers such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession in hotel prices more strongly than industrial centers such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
As far as flight prices are concerned, the trend in the first quarter is still upwards:
Due to the higher kerosene prices, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, Economy Class airfare prices fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in the first class and Business the price changes were much weaker.
In Germany, prices have plummeted even more than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9%, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6%.
As for domestic German flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the collapse in prices would be on the one hand economic growth downwards, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has collapsed.
On the other hand there would be because of the agreement on open skies, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, an increased pressure of competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared bankruptcy – in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
At Borussia Luhukay still can’t find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the lucky landing for national team player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first came into the game late and failed with a crossshot
His message was precisely formulated, it passed on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right
“We need the second goal,” Hermann Rieger exclaimed in the corridor of the Hamburg arena cabins.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the play break was over and most of them sat back in their seats.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly 3 decades, enjoying even greater esteem than some old players.
And so his warning has also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here is the second goal!
The change of position has not occurred.
“Today, not everything here was beautiful to see,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted more relaxed".
For 1-0, the Hamburgers have to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his headshot and the fact that the many weak players from Gladbach could not hurt the weak players from Hamburg.
“It was a dirty win,” Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburg SV will turn 121 this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves earlier on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports club as before the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We can put everything right," said Marcell Jansen.
He has the feeling that the provisional table certificate is more an indication of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the goal Petric as well as Jansen blown at FC Bayern – that is, slowly finds itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more dribbling,” Jol says.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear is circulating on Wall Street.
Early news of the bailout package failure temporarily brought the Dow Jones down 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in its history.
Later the Down recovered again a little bit.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock market barometer quoted/recognized with a good 5% shortfall on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was firm with a deficit of more than 7% at 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do it.
The shares of Goldman Sachs fell by just 10%.
Just a few days before the big investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
As part of the bailout plan, financial funds had to be allocated for the grabbing of the so-called mortgage documents.
The sum must be paid, however, not in one shot, but in degrees.
By extension the State had to keep the Aktienoptionsscheine of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with an appropriate trend of quotations, in order to reduce the charge to the State coffers.

The shares of the Munich real estate lender lost despite bailout action by the federal government and private banks temporarily 3 quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank gave up more than 20%.
The German stock market index DAX has slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is listed with a deficit of 3.7% out of 5,839 points.
The world stock markets are falling on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors feared the U.S. government’s $700 billion bailout might not be enough to boost financial markets.
The Dow lost in the first hour of business 334 points or 3.3% on 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout, the vote in the Senate was able to follow the first of October.
The other European stock exchanges could also only take one direction: in London for the time being the FTSE index fell by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris fell by 2.9%.
In Asia the Nikkei benchmark index after initial profits had a shortfall of 1.26% on 11,743.61 payers.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze quickly now hangs on her death by freezing.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates havoc – the anomaly of the Swing-by
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/thrust/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example from Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical device as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What has astonished scientists for years: rockets do not behave at all as one would expect under the law of gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year was renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton firmly believes as before Einstein did not make a mistake, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have spotted in the cosmos.
"The anomaly could be caused by dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about 10 years.
From her emerges evidently a force of attraction, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is evident.
Instead, she herself is completely invisible, that is, she neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation whatsoever, especially no visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter makes up at least one-fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a pre-release shooting, six kidnappers were killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are always in the crosshairs of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed
We are looking at their health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released remains unclear: therefore, the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the end of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army unexpectedly killed 6 of them.
“The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the official said.
It would have been "still only a matter of taking over the hostages", when suddenly came "this surprise".
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot and killed 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of 6 million euros from Germany; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women as hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were supposed to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo has rejected a position on the report.
The abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led to a woman killing herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise molested her and blindfolded her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead," and that she had "left with her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
She is believed to have killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession ending: "I bound her and blindfolded her."
“I didn’t sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
“This unfortunate saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he hadn’t, it would have been hard for the facts to end in court.”
I notice the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother describe having on their daughter over the years.
"Otherwise, it was clearly likely that she was a promising and happy successful young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC learned.
The man was on a trip from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the Waterloo train.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least sensitive of the charges made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
“They may have thought this was being handled internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause that concerns the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qa'ida and the capabilities of Iraq's security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the bill of B&B
British construction companies could face an account of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the bailout of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take money from savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The general manager of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is “irritating” that companies and their members have to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved cautiously ... are now called upon to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the association of construction companies, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
“It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved cautiously in the rebounding home market are now called upon to pay part of the bill to those institutions that have been much less cautious.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account,” Mr. Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk goes up to 5 pence per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five pence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after research by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to unload the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh Denied Bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729.700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many corruption allegations against you.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is expected in the coming weeks but his party, the Awami League, has called for the country’s temporary military-backed government to give her complete freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on word, it is unclear under the terms of her release whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The High Court has rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina on the grounds that she cannot have bail as she is already abroad on word for medical treatment," says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after Oct. 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said Sunday.
She was detained last year after the government flanked by military force took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of Afghan polio campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing out on the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that he cannot reach the children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this was despite Taliban promises that they would not attack or hamper thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival television station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition’s appeal court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB’s participation hindered competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's stake in ITV sowed doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by fears that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Serious allegations concerning potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or ascertained,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been rated poorer than so many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by policy.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the lawsuit against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of fraud against Democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting cases in court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm of dismissals, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officers resigned.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in the dismissals, that he had abdicated his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush's former senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will retire his special gold award at next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honored" to earn the recognition.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit track from Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year’s awards, being on the nominees list in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocalism that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number 15.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album remained on the charts for nearly nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an operation for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossroads, some famous, others merely of use.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and long-time residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and runs north on First Street – without taking Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active busy street.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The road, however, must have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated street simply because it was one of the last remnants of the stately quarter of the past.
But the city’s preservation and development department, which has control of the streets, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the committee for the use of the land of the municipal commission of the district some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the streets.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has called for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
“There is very little space left to the city’s property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,” he said.
“There could be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access.”
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that it wanted to reopen the small road and install seating, including some to use for a cafe to which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main concern is to renovate this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity,” he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Preservation Housing, said it was indeed the city’s desire to sell the road and pointed out that the agency’s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
In comparison to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous sons and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door to CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the cover photo set for the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
“The ground was beautiful,” said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, scraps of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers writing about "gentrification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of almost completely changed city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Little Nostalgic Look at the Endangered City"), has published part of a Discourse on the History of the City that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end street, dark even in the daytime and bounded by rusty iron warehouse doors and windows with gates, with weeks-old newspapers hovering along the slums."
With a few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran agilely through the back of the road near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer lying next to a bunch of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest it would need to be a little embellished.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty, disgusting places."
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow in California studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School.”
Really attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “Afro-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama’s educational plan specifically advocates, among other things, “transient bilingual education” for English students.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in classroom languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The school’s students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth graders, an astonishing 100 percent of students took the upper-level test in the 2008 math state exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth graders took the expert-level test on the art-of-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama’s preferred one.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant assessment of skills, and an "no apologies" attitude.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s obstructive approach for English students is “full immersion.”
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We had fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you wouldn’t be able to pinpoint what it was.”
"It works," he remarked, "for us it works."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate it in other Hispanic-majority schools with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevents us from predicting Mr. Obama’s answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the topic trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "you need to make sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil drops sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the U.S. bailout for the financial markets may fail to boost the economy.
Crude futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Stock Exchange in morning trading.
Prices have dropped more than $20 a barrel since Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street financial turmoil, and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plunged to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before rising again amid tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety swayed investors again Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the bailout, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the hectic weekend negotiations had led to a bailout deal “appear to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape contagion.
From a commodity perspective our most pressing concern is how far the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year as home oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, lowering forecasts on oil and gas prices by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter sets a team record.
After spending more time than anyone in the Jets' uniform in the last eight or more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals matched the grayness of the menacing clouds overhead with a soft game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing tune took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when one cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get out of my path," said Favre of all the passages arrived in Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication was great, despite what people may think."
While Favre and Coles played catch games, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner hard.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a loose throw and re-raised it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith foresaw another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens forced a Warner fumble.
The last turnover, the forced fumble by Bowens, may have been the most notable.
The Cardinals took the lead over that possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets took the ball back with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, for a 34-0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told both - the Jets gave him 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Gebrselassie rested surpasses his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathoner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile run under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win over the flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered his previous score of 2:03:26 last year in Berlin for 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record for such a stunning career that he produced a world championship or a world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in hindsight - that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to race in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a scorching average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-backs like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went long distances, the marathon record fell by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa do Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had calf cramps and missed a week of training.
Clearly, rest left him cool, not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He has been somewhat criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s East African rival – for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars, counting on trailblazers as if it were a midfielder, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie’s skills as a marathon runner.
With the pace cadenced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie after the trailblazers vanished.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final jump to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best time of nearly 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident but healed to win in Berlin, making her personal best time of nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing her calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners start off with a big detachment, picking them up after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extended theme park on the outskirts of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the enormous, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come to life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city incorporated into the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as he described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, Harlem Renaissance's most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city he described – and which makes tourists stop by understanding it in the Florida tour guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project – remains a separate place.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that “knowing so little about us, she doesn’t know what she’s missing.”
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on race, many here remain wary of the outsider’s gaze.
“We are very cautious about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power grabbing and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shade of oaks of the sometimes disdained, sometimes award-winning rural culture of the South born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's imagination really began with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the often-forgotten center of Florida into a setting of black history and human drama.
Low as a heap in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
"Outside the street on the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white trim, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits the passing rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly this was not Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it the way it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls Hurston immortalizes by quoting men who sing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds, "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family moving to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembers that when Hurston stepped into the city, he usually arrived without warning in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts of dignified clothing today.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others smiled.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin said.
But, she added, swinging on her chair on the patio at the back above Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big commemorative ceremonies, and no big conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane highway.
Orlando’s expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 across the city’s western boundary.
The proposal came as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had brought an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the front door of the community.
"During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on the side," says Mr. Franklin.
“We actually had a girl who was killed by that one time.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor to my race."
Residents now say that desegregation of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville’s cohesion and jeopardizes the confidence of its young people.
“Black children were used to being hugged — I remember this — hugging your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
“You didn’t hug your white teacher because your white teacher...- I mean, there’s a cultural divide there,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and created room for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to Hurston’s plaqueless tomb and began to struggle for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed Robert E. Hemenway biography of Hurston hit the shelves of bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had turned on the spotlight again.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning in 1988 a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its project on the road.
"The five lanes of the resurrected highway, brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd puts it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the city’s image of itself.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical record in 1998.
A new one-story bookstore (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a re-paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a back road in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It’s 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to look for the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
Permission requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, for some things — such as the murals on Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields — are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a plump teacher, with a fondness for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of city pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing her entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, not better, not worse and proud, creative, great worker, foolish and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, which he said might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they've just come in here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said after Mass on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a pretty city.”
Here in New York we all speak fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newspaper stalls and the huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t notice they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that glass offices, honeycombs above their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live every day the worst “ugly day in the office” since the collapse of 1929.
The messengers shake metal trolleys for tea through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken stretched shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on a working day.
It didn’t seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings book on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had planned the thing to coincide with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desk, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask directions to the Macy's department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would have learned from Starr, my "trusted banker," were in line for the same reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken their savings from smaller banks where they commute, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit unions and types of city savings banks whose branches operate only within a state, and they say they treat customers like family members.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been submitted to controlled administration, and while New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The employees and clerks who stood in front of me, scared of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking for more bonds from Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its emaciated CEO Dick Fuld in full familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform doorman, almost 50 years old from my condo, changed the subject from our normal conversation topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim tombs desecrated while Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs like those representing mosques with a red line passing in between.
Police have blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties made a lot of money in the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The culprits spray-traced Jewish symbols such as the Star of David over some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations driven by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shocked” by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria has meanwhile embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with a vehemently anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, claiming that they are political symbols of the continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analysis made immediately after the election, which established the far right as the nation’s strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Forbidden travel abroad to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of sexual abuse of minors, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed authorities that he wanted to go to Spain via France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent police last Thursday after they provided prosecutors with evidence of previous arrests of Glitter for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the Ashford High Court hearing in Kent but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at the Ashford prairie, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr Paul Gadd's overseas travel to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the sex offender registry.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give police seven days notice of his planned departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or Glitter’s possible moves into the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: “The Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have the right comprehensive systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of convicted sex offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter arrived he flew to Bangkok where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not pass him through passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to let him in and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officers insisted he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the prairie of Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him on the sex offender register.
Glitter had previously been incarcerated in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the interior secretary, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no steering wheels, no old-fashioned clothes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or the woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day more and more," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the scene.
These people portrayed “on the road” are “artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and to capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are inner.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With a passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a slab camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and the material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the conception of flamenco typical of Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not the dance, the singing or the playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of conquering the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, figure in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraiture led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, know them and be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or compare with people, characters that sometimes you don’t even know or that give you just a few minutes to take the photo.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to materialize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the gallery El Fotómata, at number 20 of via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "gamble"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project on which he is working, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in the Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Always favored for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project that he is dealing with today "is a chance" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I wouldn't write it, but I'll do it anyway and hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by participants – an ancient edition of Dickens’ book “Our mutual friend” – filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer has found himself in front of an audience to which time has flown when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, recalled how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "modo"
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa stressed, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "it makes people "more unconformist" and "it invites us to write."
Time hinders the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of the races
The celebration of the bullfights that should have sealed the days of the Festival of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the races had verified that the conditions of the ground of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, has decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The weather has ravaged this Festival, preventing it from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bullfight.
The billboard featured Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were expected to face a Castilblanco bull.
Therefore, the Festival had regular run only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting off three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having bullfighted with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races receiving greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than thanks to the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, he earned the whistles of most of the audience.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the checkpoint in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
The officers intimate the alt to the two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, flee.
Officers subpoenaed the two occupants of a van who instead of stopping, fled.
Their cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years, identified as A. A. J., according to the statement of the Interior Department of the Basque government.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and falsifying public documents.
The incident occurred when some officials of the Alava road were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, breaking orders, accelerated abruptly and crossed the checkpoint.
Officers chased after the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the side of the road and its two occupants fled to a wooded area.
The Ertzaintza agents then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took note of it after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish slices, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for thorough investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since officials have verified that the license plate had been "doubled" because it did not coincide with that reported in the van's documentation, the arrested was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee A. A. J. was taken to the police station to carry out appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving on Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda from the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers as she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, a spokesperson for the California highway told People magazine.
The witness specified that around 4.30 p.m. the Locklear "squeezed the throttle thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with abrupt maneuvers back and forth.
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first glance apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that the Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had exited the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, partially blocking the road.
"She seemed confused," and that's why officers took her to a drug and alcohol center for testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress proved to be collaborative and the hypothesis of excessive alcohol was dismissed from the outset, although "according to what officers initially observed, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was discharged from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the IU and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of the formation to make a decision on the case of the former councillor for Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt vis-à-vis what has so far been an advisor in the Seville council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for “transparency” in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. “The UI has always wanted this type of investigation to be as transparent as possible.”
Likewise, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public positions."
"Blood of May", Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós’ Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garci reproposes in Sangre de mayo the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in theaters, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this film "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who had commissioned him from the Community of Madrid three years before shooting a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2nd. The director had accepted on condition that the story of Nacionales was based on the novel Episodio.
The 15 million budgets allocated in full by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate sets and costumes to portray "a stunned Spain that misjudged the choice of the leader for whom to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII", Garci noted.
However, the director regrets that he has not received the same funding as Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes from the set that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver a empezar, has influenced what is his usual work practice, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's job lies in going to the theater and the cinema to know what is happening in the sector in which he works."
Many of the performers, some of whom are in the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Oscar nominee four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos - do not represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema "that should instead be known."
From this film Garci does not expect prizes.
“At first you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and at some point you settle for just making one more film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Seville dancer pays tribute to another dancer also from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with the family to London.
She was a dancer of free dance and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me this character. It seemed incredible."
The dancer says: "We do not pretend to tell her whole life, but to collect the spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested to me some basic elements of flamenco.
Thus, "la danza de la mariposa" suggested to me a guajira, or "la danza de la serpiente" some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dancing is part of this aesthetic as well,” she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as she does in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been a student of hers.
"Matilda plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work on my work and I am very honored to do so.”
The set also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal accompaniment of these artists who have always been dive around, and spa.
The work also presents in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all Europe, since, usually, she resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her, because I think she’s one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her, much less considers her work as something of value,” says Bayon.
The show will begin today, at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega theatre.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poeta recién casado" the Triennium also closes
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Department of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon's letter of death" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftyth anniversary
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" ends with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of the Nobel Prize and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel popo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after having touched the various provinces of Andalusia with the International Congress in New York.
In addition, the Department of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has left.
It cost him a lot to win an Oscar.
He had been retired since 2007.
And it was also known that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country have been able to be better because of his existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark time, out of fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, desperately searching for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue, and still people to admire, you don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and advocate for lost and won causes, from the anti-drug foundation created in honor of the firstborn who died of an overdose to the creation of the brand of homemade and organic food.
All gifts to a country that cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without caring about nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that no man died, an era is over.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing less than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has dared to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
“He set a very high standard for all of us,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for uprightness and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some are trying and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He was divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained loyal although he certainly did not miss the opportunities to not be so.
"Why do I go out to eat hamburgers today, if I have a steak in the house?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, no one was as proud of him as a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race," but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which, if it were later taken into account in the evaluation and I had to examine them, would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the dorsal, which assumed that you would leave earlier.
It didn’t seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, let it be to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, you don't.
You had to go only to get the dorsal (first nonsense, go only for this) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they had T-shirts only in size 'S' (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small t-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things of this kind are inept compared to the day of the race itself.
In addition to having to go very early to get the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that is expected more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started that we had not even yet deposited the backpack, although, once we succeeded in the enterprise, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts at popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the ranking in correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, did not record the arrival correctly.
In the future, if I am asked about the perfect race, it will not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft Search Receptionist (Virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft unveiled a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company's campus) assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group those present in conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that she does not belong to the group she is talking to and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be at her disposal shortly.
All without a blue screen.
Awesome.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about a strategy change at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would be five times faster – hey! Steve, it’s going to be “at least”.
All a discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows features and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
It takes the computer only to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and we spend more time daily surfing the web than in a remote windowed environment.
What are half of the applications in the operating system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a viable alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and here is a small example.
I took the picture in this post at one of Microsoft’s employee recreation facilities in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soda machine a sign urges them to use their own search tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to search online.
Last week, however, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be released in early 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso took her to the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shined in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the uniform typical of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the apparitions of the stars, we can evoke the image of the strongman with the pointed mustache that lifts the weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's t-shirt, with the inside of cotton, tight and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the English speakers call it, although, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" stands out from the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt wear as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" stands out from the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not only about the famous "tanks".
Also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor t-shirts, baby dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new business in the field of fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities lending their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the firm Mango made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, it conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the fall-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and at the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let’s say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango start in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the 50s and 60s, from here we derive various inspirations.
Then, I love getting lost in the city and observing how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do this frequently.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, although in the end, everything merges and there are many elements in common.
From a young age I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to search my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid close attention to dressing.
It is known that dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and to the sages, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when they give you the wardrobe is the moment when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you went into a crisis?
No, no, no.
I've never heard it better. I like the idea of 30.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience of savoring life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock does not scare me.
I did the things I wanted since I was a little girl and this gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks for it and also I want to be a young mother, this I do not want to miss.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for cinema, you’re waiting for a few movies shot last year to come out in different theaters.
That's right, and I really want them to come out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything immediately and clearly, but it can not always be so.
I want to see "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo" come out.
Let's see if you'll like it
A few days ago you made your runway debut with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the catwalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to London to attend a charity parade for her organization “Women for a Better World” and the clothes we exhibited – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this tender side of Naomi.
So much is said about her that I, who have known her for a long time, can confirm that it is not so true.
Also, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to march for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pine, I would have done it anyway.
If it’s to help third world women, you can’t back down.
Recurrent drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, install in their car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of intoxication or if you do not blow into the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a pilot project lasting one year.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since he will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the General Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Fondazione Istituto Tecnologico per la Securitate dell'Automobile (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving intoxicated then return to drive the car.
The alcoholock would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices can reduce up to 65% of the infractions committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to put a stop to these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and, no doubt, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
The device, however, is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some commercial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 5.40 p.m., according to the program, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias traveled landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced him to use his hand as a visor to watch the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time ... You're from here or ...
- No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well what the principles of Asturias are and the importance of travel.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport crushed by the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 navy soldiers offering the salute of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, hair in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that in Mexico City threatened bad weather.
They give photographers a smile and a short stop before passing through the room where the official entourage awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a witty Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best award offered by fashion
Probably there is no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award, than Paris and there is probably no more exquisite and bont vivid designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Moreover, it is the second store of the company by size in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the closeness of the most exquisite paintings of Chagal, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and doing of necessity virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some complements of ELAH to take away the breath and to the arm of his son Luis - a big guy of almost two meters in height - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honours of home and knighthood which he finished, along with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirts – drawn by her hand – transformed herself for dinner, wearing a very sensual long black dress and got excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the room for the ballet essays and she, recalling other times, “grasped a bar” and “grasped a bar”.
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the building, but she had shown us the photos of her son on her mobile phone before.
The next day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez – another big guy who moves by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had made sure beforehand that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and hectic daily life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7, but it’s even worse to imagine yourself involved in the hectic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the difficulty of breaking free from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga poses, classic massage or “spa” treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of her book, all a “menu” of options tailored to each person’s taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "manual" denies this belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn’t already flow into your veins to regain your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who talk while staying asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you get a scare, but it doesn’t really matter much.
This is a benign sleep disorder called sleep apnea.
It occurs with some frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you spoke in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadicly (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, nocturnal enuresis (peeing in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As already mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitement.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (screams, screams, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a vent to the situation.
We have said that this is a benign disorder so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stress situation).
What can be done, instead, is to consider a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to overexcite the child before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tiring to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more comfortably.
Once sleepwalkers appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.

Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and so he is resting.
Remember that if you look very distressed and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You will not get anything, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he is saying but not to see what he is dreaming of to say it, so you have to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions it might lead to.
Never tell your child that you might ask him or her questions overnight to learn his or her secrets.
Not even a joke.
Such a thing causes enormous anguish.
In short, do not worry, it is nothing serious, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern has finally found its way back to home victory after a long, unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Black-Yellows created the most net chances, turning one into the game’s victory.
The pace was not very fast during this match in which the attackers struggled to express themselves.
After a first attempt by the captain of the host team Kauffmann who touched the seventh with a shot from afar, the Illhaeusern began to take over and one after the other provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain top and still Diebold.
Dannemarie responded with a midfield block, leaving only the unleashed Riahi at the attacking tip.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial chances signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the first goal of Marais for Illhaeusern, well positioned, resumed a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern gunner will not be able to savor his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in inferiority numerical.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose great problems to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, just backed up to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rocky action, the ball touched the cross.
Sarkozy meets with fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stop in Brittany.
Before the demonstration of the fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the president of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that "he will present himself with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the surge in the price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them about possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and to make safe working conditions and the remuneration of sailors".
The fishermen await Nicolas Sarkozy standing still.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "snail operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon peninsula a road blockade has been implemented.
On Monday, sailors already showed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, starting at dawn, while protests were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fishing vessels remained at the pier, or to Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe et du Croisic, near the Atlantic Loire, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the well-known refinery Total of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give in" and "they do not intend to move to Paris," announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is only reached with a diesel less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.30 per liter.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and even Sam Mendes saluted the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecast for 2008
The aircraft maker has 215 deliveries this year, despite threats of recession weighing on the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest company in the sector, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
During the first half, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially for aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, set up by the U.S. monetary authorities, would sell more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion-dollar loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of much of its assets, in addition to the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the newspaper said on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible disposals, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to divest include its airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly obtain liquidity in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities seize 80% of its capital.
Paris: history Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange experienced a historic crash on Monday, after the House of Representatives voted against the Paulson plan to bail out financial institutions: the Dow Jones fell 6.98%, a never-seen drop, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) is higher than that of September 17, 2001, the day of the reopening of the stock exchanges following the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq, the index of major tech stocks, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 broadened index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, according to the definitive closing figures.
Demoralized at the start of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout, intended to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favor, representatives rejected funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two in three Republicans rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"All this signals how much the market relied on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
“If the project were indeed moribund ... then the watchdog would be quickly handed over to the Fed and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
“Every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution in the United States,” the statement said.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities arranged the purchase of Wachovia’s banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging emergency intervention in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only facing a US crisis, but a global crisis," FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on 10-year Treasury Bonds fell to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, while the 30-year yield is at 4.161%, compared to 4.357% the previous day.
Obama wins first TV duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House, here is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic campaign proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, while deserving, was not brilliant enough to allow him to curb the decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which a poll published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat has prevailed.
An instant poll conducted by CBSNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39 percent of them consider Obama the winner, while 25 percent point to McCain.
A strong performance by his longtime colleague Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm Obama's lead on Thursday.
“Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He's got a good intuition," Clinton said this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, emphasizing the "naivety" of the opponent regarding the topics addressed during the first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he has repeatedly said.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president,” he said.
What since yesterday has been a continuous target for the Republican television campaign.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without length, it proved concise and precise.
It has promoted its readiness to make the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
“McCain never understood, unlike Obama,” he said in a Democratic ad this weekend, berating the Republican for failing to take the necessary measures to address the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a sweeping rain, for an election meeting.
He has not even spoken the words "middle class" or "workers". The financial crisis is in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
“Next week could be a turning point,” said the influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's economic intuition to that of Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming his intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street shocks, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
Cautiously, the two candidates have dodged the demands centered on the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) bailout plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there was an election?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge the results of the legislative elections in advance.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening after the closure of polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislature.
While still waiting for the results, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some people confess that they haven't even voted: "What's the point? They'll do whatever they want with my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good appearance before foreign observers with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including a visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and asset freezes, could be lifted if these elections were deemed legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the counting of votes," complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a change of facade," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the ballots and in this case it is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, it is because they have been nominated, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can entail a television space, regional meetings and bills.”
The opposition therefore has the duty to enter the political game because "we must start dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not make any reforms, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the organization for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the ballot.
He stresses that participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has given rise to all kinds of manipulation.
"Have you not noticed that there were elections?" asks the social democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one at the polls.
And there will have been a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones most convenient to power.”
Night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are pleased with their success.
The meeting - The blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And most importantly, it has regained the trust of the public, seriously shaken by the blood-infected scandal in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Faced with such drama and population protests, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public inquiry, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
As Judge Krever delayed writing a report, some provinces set up a committee to devise a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau committee.
As a result of the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Québec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its operations, only 38% of people said they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was mortifying.
“Thanks to continued efforts to improve blood safety and field research over the years, we have regained the public’s confidence,” he said, adding that by the beginning of 2008, about 94 percent of Quebec’s population had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells the one who has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
“And we didn’t know at all whether that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when you have doubts and could get a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was rejected.
Now, for some years now, it has been proven that this disease is undoubtedly transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (TAN) that allow the presence of the virus in the blood of donors and not the presence of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, that is, from the moment the person contracted the disease to that in which the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
It was possible to reduce that period to a duration of less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not being able to detect them has thus decreased significantly.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, this means that 12 million blood samples will need to be distributed before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted by transfusion is detected.
I believe that today one can feel at ease in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to regain health, says the head of the direction of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
We need to be constantly vigilant,” Dr. Décary continued, noting that in addition to having secure resources, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
“The needs are increasing as the population ages.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors, which on average constitutes only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec acceptable as donors.
However, all healthy people over the age of 18 who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria is widespread, they will be rejected for a period equal to one year.
“With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Cases of shortages are very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this group of donors as they get older and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to retain them and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so hectic that it is hard to find an hour to donate blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively for serious burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with Héma-Québec, which runs the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is plenty of blood rich in stem cells that can serve to cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated a few weeks ago when our 1,000th cord blood sample was placed in the bank and we expect to collect more than 1,000 each year.
You should start proposing them for transplants early next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of drawing cord blood as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - The Impact in the semifinals
The Impact Montreal qualified for the semi-finals of the Serie A qualifiers, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a decisive second quarter-final game, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal in the 90'.
After a first half without goals on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
In the first round-trip game on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder scored a first 3-1 in the return game by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed later in the day.
In short - Deciding network of Kovalev
The Canadian and its aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for victory in the fourth of the Habs' preparatory games.
The only goal signed by Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to overreact in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation."
Charest Point North
The prime minister does not rule out starting elections before the end of the year.
At the conclusion of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, in Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left) tries to get elected on the occasion of the partial elections today.
"Enlarging the borders of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday to Levis, by means of tools with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "image mill".
On three big screens, they merged spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
It's as big as in the middle of the election campaign.
During the press conference, however, the prime minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he pointed out that he was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labor, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the most recent speeches of the prime minister, the opening of the North—the northern territory at the 49th parallel—had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but did not comment on timing or investment quotas, as well as not explaining what the precise priorities will be in the realization of future projects.
At the most, he has confined himself to highlighting what he believes deserves a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
That "territory twice as big as France" is here, it's Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us," he insisted, as if to urge a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The north, 70 percent of Quebec’s territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the press conference.
“It is a position traditionally held by all governments.
"There is a border line that hasn't been agreed on for a long time, and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
"Considering climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North," he said of the Northwest Passage, which will be open year-round due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.”
What about the locals, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to this and that the project would be in their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the PQ of Ungava), have already started the consultation of about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position, has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, “not necessarily a summit,” but a time when “common visions will be provided.”
The development of the North would, moreover, adhere to the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal first ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to stand out to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Station in Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, which nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he resorted to another reference, conservative this time, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest specified that its commissioning would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will make it," he confessed to his militants, arousing heartfelt applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who in April claimed there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a poll in the fall, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very committed, especially to a Federal Council mission to China and to the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend's General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smoothly as oil: the PLQ demands above all recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the draft of the North Plan has been met with skepticism.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has re-dusted the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
Had he done so, "we would have made progress today," Marois said alongside Jean-Talon candidate Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope is that this is not simply perceived as a spectacle," said leader Sébastien Proulx, a replacement for Mario Dumont, on his way home from the holidays.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former Justice Minister of the Harper Cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to declare that Louise Arbor was a “shame” for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the Prime Minister’s entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government which is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, who has not repatriated one of its citizens detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
For information, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, call for the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that he can be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely that same government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of oppression.
We do not yet realize it, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper does not cease to flaunt and which sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we are at the moment when there is no longer any moral: you can mistreat, torture, imprison arbitrarily a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today minority (to see what will be after October 14 ...).
Numerous voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame is right here, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, managing vice president of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small, squatter publishing house with the intention of launching a "transparent public debate."
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a defamation complaint, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to hers.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the writers and the publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend a substantial sum of money in order to organize their defense and fight, with decidedly odd weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by the practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these odd-numbered struggles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual settlement that will muzzle the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to speak out again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before public opinion that she should have presented her own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada usually take place with the exchange of opinions and not with batons.
It would therefore have been enough for the company to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and badly rejects petitions and letters in support of Black Canada authors.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a “public” debate when his contempt for that same audience is evident?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word indicates only the well-paid lawyers and not all Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the light of what many perceive as a sort of gag (seeking the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum telling them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver’s surreal discourse, Barrack Gold’s lawsuit constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies the right to cite authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss about uncomfortable topics to the richest companies in the world, under penalty of multiple lawsuits, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific standards as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the university world, as is public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to curb abusive lawsuits.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street - Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, representatives of the Republican and Democratic side, yesterday finally reached an agreement on the largest bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been weighing on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by the two houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right of inspection on the remuneration paid to the managers of the protected companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Senator Judd Gregg at the negotiating table announced the good news just minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on the markets,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Every decision has been made in a way that safeguards the economy and the American people from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
“This is the crucial point: If we hadn’t acted in this way, invaluable heartbreak and upheaval would have spilled over into the daily lives of Americans,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The time limit agreed corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
United later in the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential elections were rather favorable to the agreement, without however avoiding expressing their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with adding some provisions to the agreement, in particular one that will allow owners to keep their homes and that inherent in the salaries for managers of companies covered by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on the American television screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he would vote in favor of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
“According to what I’ve read, it’s something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward.”
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to repurchase with taxpayer money the dubious, risky, and unsold assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a real estate bubble that has led first to the collapse of mortgages at risk (mortgages), then to extend to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and result in the freezing of liquidity and the slump of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of incumbent Republicans who blew up the first draft of an agreement last week.
They seem to have come out of that dead-end since Democrats accepted that the “toxic” assets of some struggling companies are only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision was added that if the government were to face losses over the next five years as a result of such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which can be added another 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The $350 billion payment should be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the protected companies that will be worth dividends in the event of a profit and that it can resell when the waters have calmed down.
According to the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay foreclosure procedures related to real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and start-up allowances paid to executives of the companies involved.
As of today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the House of Representatives vote, and to the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be cleared.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both on the Republican and Democratic sides.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t hear you,” said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Not to take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of skeptics," Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to say: We ask Congress not to draw any hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the test of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would renounce the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after losing 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) to the crisis of mortgage loans at risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It's not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, you get influence and voting rights in banking matters.
It’s certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are uncertain.”
During this period, at the other end of the English Channel, the British government seems to be in the process of nationalising another bank on the brink of the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all the loans currently underway at the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a nationalization process by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time her ace in the sleeve, for others her weak spot.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to real sacred monsters.
What constancy!
Paul Newman, who passed away Friday, at the age of 83, on his Connecticut ranch, following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also a spokesman for freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
From mixed couples are often born magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Since he recognized a country inhabited by the safe made man, the warrior of the Pacific, proud in combat, who in the early 50s studied dramatic art at Yale, he subsequently attended the Actor Studio of New York, before triumphing in theater, television and soon in the cinema.
The same civil rights activist was also the driver who ranked second at the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They leave with him the shadowy areas of a star reserved, discreet, committed, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which you will never be able to fully unravel the mystery.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend the disappearance of Paul Newman was a heart-wrenching dive for moviegoers, as his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy (1969) and that boy unable to desire his fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) are confused in The Cat on the Hot Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep what was promised.
Many more Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Up There Someone Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and reprised after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's The Spaccone (1961), Martin Scorsese's The Colour of Money (1987), which earned him the only Oscar out of nine nominations.
That face through the years, it was hers.
He's still here.
Epochs follow through his path.
The young people know him especially for the cult movie Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him back in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, by the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with a final role as godfather of the Irish Mafia in Era mi padre, in 2003.
Unlike the more-degree film legends who soon abandoned the craft, Newman will remain for a long time in theaters, denouncing Hollywood in all its splendor, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, called it, with a hint of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging its performances exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, scoundrel alcoholics or desperate, of which he expressed debauchery and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pure sensibility.
The first time Jennifer, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward as the protagonist, drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated to him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes that rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (who had starred together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the deceased actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the Hollywood drift is thus extinguished.
We will have seen her face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging it a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
The proceeds from those sales were, however, earmarked for his troubled Children's Foundation.
Newman, instead of resting on his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege.”
It was also a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, then, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & Partners?
On October 8, the hearing of the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and associates will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed as part of a criminal association that has caused significant damage, and other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the money obtained from competition calls was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the performance of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, a total of 65 million guilders, ended up partly in the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, disclosed by the investigating authorities, they took the money obtained from calls for tender on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the invoice blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, while the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue the invoices, it was established among other things during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter's confession he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for consumptions, on the model of these then invoices were prepared to be forwarded to competition calls, among others, to those of the Ministry for Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, has mainly written the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of the "study trip" of Lados was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurateur, would not all enter the club together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, hereinafter called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert, is full of formal and content errors.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however there were 130 guests on the invoice.
But the fancy invoice compilers exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, in whose accounting - according to the information released to the judicial authorities - there were not even the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s director, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to prosecution and invoiced, he immediately realized that they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name and VAT number of our company were in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons did not even return the fact that according to the invoice 100 people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
In addition, the bill was for catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The assiduous invoice compilers did not bother to find out that the Budapest travel agency of their choice only organizes trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with cash payment trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing invoices of the company.
In addition, as shown during the survey, VAT was also included on the invoice, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favor of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, in fact, on the services offered by the company you have to apply the VAT at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition, the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, while the invoice was manufactured.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as an activity carried out the transport of goods by road, as it is known from the procedure of the Prosecutor's Office, an activity that was not carried out by the company founded originally for investment advice.
In addition, for formal defects - due to non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it was discovered that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Field, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület lunched there, precisely for this reason the curator of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They have consciously issued invoices
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért for almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft, which is currently in liquidation, has also collaborated with Zuschlag and its partners. In 2003, it provided invoices worth around 5 million guilders to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület Association.
Not even movement of money because the invoices prepared were then reversed, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of firms issuing invoices belong those who are connected with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized at the address of the General Manager of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with fuel and automotive trade.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer media, for a value of around 18 million florins.
According to the data of the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The general manager of this company was a Romanian, to whom Ivan Kubatov reportedly forwarded documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the firms Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány and the countervalue was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
However, the companies were useful to him because at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the Zuschlag-related associations: the Atlasz and the Y-Generació.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued to the various entities 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million guilders.
The prosecution believes that Kubatov pocketed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition announcement.
Y-Generación and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a call for tenders for the Socialist Party's public utility, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the notice.
In order for this not to come to light, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing a part of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecution, will probably report on the development of the production of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing might be if the number one defendant, János Zuschlag, decided to lift the veil on everything.
His confession hasn’t been very detailed so far, and although he has promised to talk about everything extensively over and over again, he hasn’t done so yet.
You have to see if it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have made arrangements with Zusi, who - in exchange for compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could also have been offended by the fact that his requests to ease his conditions of imprisonment, i.e. the granting of house arrest, have so far not been met.
While the perpetrators of commercial crimes not compensable and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The Psychology of Excess Bidding: Why Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers are inclined to spend more, to overvalue the merchandise.
Neurologists and economists at New York University have been able to uncover the neuro-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science men do not want to stay behind in a race such as the eBay auction, so they are willing to pay a higher price too.
The research tried to trace the nervous pattern of this "match" at the level of the nervous system through experimental rods.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active brain areas of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win some money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body striated under the cerebral cortex intensively goes into operation when you lose to the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price increase is explained by the vehement reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial tracking survey.
In this survey, three groups tendered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was told what the real value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
In addition to this, another group has been promised that in case of winning they will receive another prize of $15.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost the money in the event of a loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the win was underlined, while for the other the loss.
Proving the neurologists' hypothesis members of the group that played "against the loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control group or "win".
“These findings are not deducible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
These in fact until now explained the phenomena that can be found at auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only neurological imaging methods helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so we came to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University's School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to see the doctor?
Nearly half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients amounts to a hundred thousand, of whom only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know that they are infected.
The definition hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal leakage, saliva).
For travelers it is useful to get vaccinated against viruses A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots form on the skin and the whites of the eyes, the stools become light and the urine dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancers and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancers.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens deviously destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
In the world today the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease it is worth turning to the family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 worldwide by patient associations.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, the religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford have conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out on 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while all were observing a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to repel much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University take part.
The test went exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci’s Hermelin painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to have a reassuring effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this period of time received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel “safe,” as if “someone took care of” them and “they were reassured and pervaded by peace.”
Looking at the religious-themed image they accounted for 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work before them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that a similar result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but you have to find the right image.
"We have to look for an image towards which they have very positive feelings, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it manages to change our personality,” Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains if the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to the believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On their 10th birthday, Google can claim to be both in people’s pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they have spent their holidays, which clinic they attend and what interests them.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the company, is not enough yet.
As for the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they don’t really see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main purpose is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users, and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google’s founders, which was: “we put all the information in the world into one system!”
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt said: “He would like if Google could answer questions like ‘what do I do tomorrow?’ or ‘what would be the right job for me?’, but the software doesn’t know how to answer seemingly simple questions because it doesn’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their internet searches exactly the words they are looking for are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search initiated two years ago, for example, users can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these then in the long run will generate much better tailored results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our preferences declared and registered previously.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - they ask users concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the reactions of Internet users are caused by the fright felt by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by the rebellion to power.
One fact is confirmed, however, that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times has been perhaps the coordinated action against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made possible the identification of pedophiles from the page of the Orkut community maintained by Google.
Internet users concerned about personal rights instead sighed with relief in May when the company - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even later you can not force Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information requested secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully ripped off nearly 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the Child Protection Act passed years earlier, but still failed to obtain individual user search lists and the entire list of two-month-old web pages and keywords.)
The judgment of Google is therefore rather contradictory: those who are afraid to provide their personal data slap Google because they believe that this is how their intimate sphere and privacy is affected by starting to use its services and rise up with the rebellion due to multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is always kept up to date and the package of programs is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies precisely one of the keywords repeated most often in recent years, the web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, of intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can link them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all of these can insert them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, he can also write blogs on which his latest photo galleries automatically appear stored on Flickr or on Picasa.
Meanwhile we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common tour of friends, comes to know easily with whom she spent the night her perfidious boyfriend or a company can fire an employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the top of the company: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has now been completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid the monopoly of Google can do so (starting for example with Scroogle using the Google search system but at the same time not voluntarily leaving traces).
There are not a few people who do not deliberately register on community pages to not be found, Google's online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not tied to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far.
The public is not even secretly waiting for the moment when Google will pull out its claws.
Currently, the company with its 156 billion dollars worth is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords / AdSense advertising space threatens the revenue of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time cause serious harm not only to Microsoft but also to many software development companies.
However, the critical observers next to all this find alarming points: the company summit for example has completely rejected the protest of the employees after doubling the fee of the company's kindergarten, has considered too expensive the repeated catering to the daily pleasure of employees, all this however diminishes the fact that in 2006 Google has bowed the head to the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter the interests.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, however, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and magazines from Google will take on such proportions that our company will soon find itself in front of the American Health Supreme Court, others are afraid of the system.
The fact that Google is building a genetic data base can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled tale by the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two Minors Helped <0xC3><0x93>zd’s Double Murderer Disappear Traces
Police have questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, who are well-founded suspects of helping to make the traces of the crime disappear, said a spokesman for the Borsod Region Police Station on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the crime to their accused, they are currently accused of aiding.
The two minors, two girls according to the MTI, are defending themselves freely.
The aid is punishable by up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated multiple homicide for profit.
The investigation found that the 23-year-old had a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, which is why last Wednesday he lured his creditor into a construction site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million, about CZK 5 billion, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of its shares within a few months.
The Czech financial daily E15 says the offer from the Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far made an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all those interested the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, nearly 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Bank <0xC4><0x8C>eská Spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster happened thanks to the American president, who has not been able to compact his party behind a hurriedly drunken law, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire superfinancier Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 9/11.
Even a part of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means for managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat, the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva said.
Some states today can still offer a bailout to staggering financial institutions and with taxpayer money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as if in a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long term it is necessary for the member states of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the dismembered financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, according to Der Standard, a Viennese newspaper, which reports that there are increasingly real concerns that European taxpayers, like American taxpayers, will also have to use their portfolios to remedy the crisis.
The EU has not so far cared much about the crisis that has swept across the old continent like a tsunami.
The "rescuers" do not have to wave the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion immediately, however it would be better if they determined in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money to prevent greater damages.
Intelligent machine imitates the flight of the hornet
What could be the best way to develop anti-collision technologies if not to imitate the sensors of obstacles found in nature?
For example, those of the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the hornets gave Nissan engineers an initial strategic cue on how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic minicar with the properties of bees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really looks very much like our protective shield – explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technologies and research and development at the exhibition.
Important is the role of the bee's sight, capable of a 300-degree view in each direction.
The engineers drew on the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of bee sight.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the necessary extent to avoid the accident.
This maneuver of avoidance, in a different way from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If it weren’t so, the robot car wouldn’t be able to react quickly to avoid collisions,” says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect what one bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees the deviation can not go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steerability of the wheels.
In this way instead of the infinite possibilities available to the bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lighter, high-energy-density lithium polymer batteries, which means they last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of the data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot needs to process some input in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvring data, so it only uses a memory of a few tens of Kb.
There is no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of an immediate collision avoidance technology that, according to Nissan, can be installed on production vehicles within 10 years.
Further application can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding obstacles on the road leads to destination.
They also found the name of the expensive baby
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout law for the purchase of disproportionate credits, to be applied in several parts, has been drafted.
In the first step half of the amount is spent.
In the new agreements that run until midnight on Saturday according to East Coast time, congressional leaders decided on the $700 billion bailout after a debate that lasted for days, Reuters reported.
“We have made serious strides,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, adding that the only thing left to do is to put the deal on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise plan.
Treasury Minister Henry Paulson, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said: the program will work and be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, it is not about the rescue of Wall Street but the reversal of the economic wagon.
The written version of the plan was made public prior to the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. Washington time (Monday 2 a.m. Central European time), but it did not bring much stock market growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the bill called the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 regarding the program, then it will fall to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the White House news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight and greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step you can spend at most half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote of Monday Congress, with these the Treasury Department will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special board will oversee the program, which also includes the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Spending the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Department can apply a combined tactic: it can buy credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits at the same time.
The purchase can take place through auctions and in a direct way - they announced competent of the ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means that give cause for concern, for which the companies will pay an adequate price for the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
“We will take all the necessary steps to make us ready to introduce the newly signed law,” he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their exit, defined by the overseas slang simply as gold parachutes.
Payment limitations will only occur in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Department will offer the help.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, if they do not retire the defunct bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of the disproportionate credits the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money of the directors is not exaggerated.
In addition, existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to incentivise participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history of a legal limitation on the remuneration of directors-general coming into force, said the measure, according to Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, decreasing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also gain from it if the economy, and along with it the saved bank, recover.
The bill includes that in the next five years the president must submit to Congress a proposal that provides how to return to taxpayers the expected losses deriving from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
That’s not what American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures were taken by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry there was a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose in August by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared in 12 months, taking into account the domestic sales of the sectors of the processing industry, the largest increases were in the sector of the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing of metal products, the price increase was 13.2%, and in the production of food, beverages and tobacco it was 11%.

Next year in the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around 12 January the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement could come into force - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
In his opinion "it now all depends on the fact that overseas the electronic entry and control system is built in time".
However, he called attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be an entry permit, however, before the departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will award the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star Cross and hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also supported the bank bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, pledged on Sunday their support for the government’s $700 billion plan to bail out banks, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days on Sunday night announced that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the plan to bail out the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of freezing the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be better suited than their rivals to pull the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with economic issues at the forefront, Obama has again regained some advantage, while McCain’s advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin as vice president, has dispersed.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps that he also supported.
"Now we have to act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He didn’t let it slip away from defining McCain’s economic ideas as outdated.
McCain said in an interview with ABC that “all of us will be putting this situation down with difficulty ... but doing nothing is not a viable path.”
The Republican senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a control committee of the finance minister and the limitation of the good outputs of top managers, things on which he was to insist.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no merit role in the deals, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi on Sunday reported that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-aware - thus analyzes Der Spiegel the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the Internet edition of the left-wing German magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution Devours its Parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-Socialists have modernized Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of epoch is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been achievable: it ended the indisputable hegemony of a party-state.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 still in the period of the aforementioned Stoiber.
The cause of this is the consequent modernization carried out in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists predicted this 40 years ago, but they made a big mistake about the weather, but secularization, educational achievements, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities and the political consequences are obvious.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-aware, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the very classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: the freelancers, the craftsmen, the graduates and the graduates.
Here support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Viennese conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" in the article "Party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confusing internal political situation in Austria following the elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> intends to deal with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the intervention of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss a coalition.
Elections have been made, now it revolves around the coalition; in the public TV discussion the party leaders have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, has confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor.
As he stated, the Schüssel-Molderer course was in any case rejected.
Repeating this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red bids.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still an open matter in the party, issues should be discussed in any case within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Jörg Haider, leader of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, repeated that he was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to take responsibility for governing," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris has started the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized this year from France having the presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Fidesz deputy of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the congress drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects Roma children and in addition the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimír <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz PE, recalled, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, that the Roma are expelled from the labor market primarily because of their low schooling.
"The majority of young Roma do not have a middle-level qualification and as a result of low-quality elementary education only a small number of them can achieve a higher qualification."
Mr Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in enforcing human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of EU member states.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the wider context between Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma start school, the more their chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market increase; through taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the nation’s budget.
“The right of Roma to European citizenship must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools,” said Lívia Járóka.
According to the deputy, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools and for this it is of fundamental importance to respect the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, we must give Roma children the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens to the future of Europe" - asked Járóka.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year, since last year's meeting in Berlin is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of Huber-Beckstein will be decided.
Although the bad electoral defeat has not yet fallen heads, at the top of the Bavarian CSU has been postponed for the moment the discussion of personal issues.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein remain in their seats, the question is how long pity lasts.
Of the fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary congress of the party in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians made known in any case that they were not attached with all their strength to the chair.
They thus tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union obtained 60.7%, now instead after the coup against Stoiber they have fallen to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of German GDP.
However, there are still conservatives in the southern region, which are of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, and they will be forced to form a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the reorganization within the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the small exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Electors, exponents of right-wing values for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Free Electors enters the legislature Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup opportunity by the Huber-Beckstein couple to then treat without regard the woman with great ambitions.
The leaders of the CSU are now concentrating all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber, who was plotting in the shadows until now, will also get an active role. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU has defined September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some statements to the CSU allegations that they deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel cannot be chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the national victory in 2005, is re-established with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide her disappointment at the fiasco, the CSU’s loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, the crisis of the Social Democrats on the other hand still lasts.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not even an opposition representative has entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers it is the sign of the well-being and stability assured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead it is explained by the frauds committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people of a country of 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections held in the parliamentary elections under disputed circumstances, "conceded to some representatives.
The SDG has thus renounced a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which has asked for credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and has agreed to give the Russians the Beltransgaz-owned pipelines crossing the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter for the anti-political situation.
It referred to a relaxation that the OSCE's election campaign assessment emphasized positive movements and not shortcomings, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates.
The OSCE's fast-paced report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates could in practice not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is perceptible: the political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even if Russia, with which Belarus forms on paper a federal state, considers the two countries independent already for a month.
We have made two steps forward and one step backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition presidential candidate of the 2006 elections it is desirable that he stay despite the fact that "the power was afraid to let even a single opponent enter a parliament without weight".
The opposition is not planning to take action to protest the results, but is trying to send the message to voters that economic reforms are necessary.
Obviously we have a lot of problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, for the distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that even the officially most helped class, that of the pensioners, does not consider adequate the Lukashenko regime which considers the creation of social security as its main result.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time before the break-up of social security "reminiscent of the sepulchral silence" - believes Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers considered the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "men believe not in words but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunette: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure against scoundrels, against those who stamp and then go to drink a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fake news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services," the minister says.
“A new season of accountability and transparency has begun.
This is reformism,” says Brunetta.
Palazzo Chigi completes the installation in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, the secretary general assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissants.
Brunetta's words, which suggest, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a conference at the School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister said that "in three months the sick leave of public employees has been reduced by 50%, or 60,000 more people at work in a year".
He added that public administration needs to be made more efficient.
“These wage dynamics have been doubled in the last 8-10 years compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates.”
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have joined forces to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by joining the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service today is calling for numbers about the least absenteeism at work due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'working fools' is constantly growing.
Thousands of correct and productive public administration employees in Italy have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatment for illness dependent on service; the extension of the time slots of availability of the sick worker, within which control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur on the job, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirms that there were about 1,200 white deaths.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by the Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "vive appreciation for the constant commitment of associations in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"Of course, an indignant 'enough' has arisen, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but the daily reality offers us dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the many initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness of the young people who face the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to linger in the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment aimed at putting an urgent end to it".
"The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight positive trend, but that does not mean that the number of white deaths is still impressive," said the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
“We would not want this ‘downward trend’ to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention loosens that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level there is still too little done to combat the phenomenon of accidents, and the fight can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our judgment - it has emphasized Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of the workers, and this starting from the world of the school".
"We need a further effort - he added - with regard to communication and awareness-raising of public opinion.
But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation protection provided for victims of work" and the "assistentialism drift towards which the system is pushing in recent years".
"The objective is therefore to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - so that the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on spontaneity or grant from time to time arranged by the legislature".
MP3 Players Under Accusation, Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to loud music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
The European Commission cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (CSSERI) published today.
“From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day while holding the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” says Meglena Kuneva.
"A clear risk emerges from the scientific evidence and we need to react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise caused by them.
"Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and related equipment."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to these sources of noise.
You can greatly limit this damage by using solutions such as reducing noise exposure levels and duration.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music equipment if they listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours per week exceed the limits currently in force regarding the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent loss of hearing after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of the users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno launches the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capitale", which settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will finalise the guidelines for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the Board and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so as to be able to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - he emphasizes Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for an idea of development of Rome that the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the Municipal Council, will then be able to use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then it will melt, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Roma Capitale".
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, his contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics crushes on the management of the daily and on the emergencies that from time to time manifest themselves.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working with seriousness on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences that the Capital expresses".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a united spirit to its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital but "also in consideration of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
A well-known American politician wrote that he wants us to pass for independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote in a web: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a tough face: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has had in all two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, they are attacks that do not say much; they are attacks clearly of a racial nature and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Again, there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the booth to vote we know very well who the American patriot will give his vote.
It comes out one side of the American mentality kept covered to the last.
“Say what you want, then we’ll figure out where to put the cross, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
Some people swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, that appears almost certainly the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89% answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq for the most part was Bush’s weak spot.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
In the United States, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the Internet, "assassinator" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control regarding the future.
Nowadays, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, news outlets have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a shattered economic model crisis.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as it is intended by the general public to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that national journalism is going the wrong way.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses are opening their way to the internet, for many seen as the "assassin" of print.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing the technology in the hope that it will “do something good” for their journalism.
The biggest divide in American journalism today is between those who run the newsrooms — that is, the directors — and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with “work safety”.
Executives who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are at 47% nationally.
For staff reporters it goes to 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and internet, employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of “take it or leave it”, take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third to reach 15 days in total after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, often “sick” during the year.
It's all about the climate.
UNIPOL: COURT ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REST IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-pact related to the escalation of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him, last week, he obtained the release from house arrest transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel from the provincial town to a home in the capital.
According to the court, however, these moves (which the prosecutor gave an opposing opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence accusing him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion bailout launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times yesterday confirmed this by informing us that the ongoing crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those in Washington" and to the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, precisely, which has become powerfully alive with the vow I said at the beginning.
But this is just one example of the changes, of the great changes, which the current economic earthquake perhaps foreshadows or already reveals: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here alone.
Both in the United States and in Europe, the crisis seems to be working as an accelerator of phenomena in incubation for a long time and in the new climate they solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category State-sovereignty in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, strong links with foreign countries, but which first of all see the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, involved to a very large extent.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of the question or has little to say: the clear evidence is given by the European Union which, as usual, divides between different interests and between different state strategies, fails to decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each individual state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all disbursement of funds: since when you get to the straits are only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to get things right.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, which probably no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is moreover in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will instead have to deal increasingly with those very little immaterial things that are water, crops, oil.
All things that, look a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are still absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So that those who are sovereign possess certainly several more cards than those who are not, those who have the misfortune of living in a place without harvests, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, however, which foreshadows a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, especially economic ones, proved to be so inadequate and full of shadows.
And at the same time something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an insufficiency, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
In other words, there seems to be a growing belief, in large sections of the population, that before their actions are the same ideas as the social elites that have so far risen, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall sense of the term, that they have made their time and are increasingly alien to the opinions of the majorities.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political arrangements, which manifests itself in the sudden electoral "revolts" or in the sudden turns of the collective moods of these last and last times, from the victory of the Americans to the rise of the conservative in Austria-Bavaria, to the collapse of the Laburists.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, are increasingly struggling to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape today in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is reinvigorating, increasing, potentially agitating.
In the face of all this, to speak of a “rebellion of the masses” on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
Keeping your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls as Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers were able to hold a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science published the findings of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by gecko legs, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure a perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time “detach easily from the wall,” says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
WALK ON THE WALLS? - "This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also pursuing a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars presented an adhesive made up of microfibers like hair that self-clean from dust while moving on a surface to always maintain a perfect grip.
Medications: never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are thirsty and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some life-saving drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the intake of certain medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia raises a new alarm: just a glass of juice of grapefruit, orange and apple health benefits to reduce the absorption of certain medications saves life.
Grapefruit juice had already been charged because it was believed to be responsible for increasing to levels deemed toxic the effects of some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistaminic and neurological medicines.
The same Italian drug agency had given news in an information bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to be careful what you drink in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
Not only pompom - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These findings are generally immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that may change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the package leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not make us impress but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification," the expert underlined to Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics for Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman for his studies of business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the major critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days of Enron's failure, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked a lot of controversy and that for years was blamed on the economist, but which now proved to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and also a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a “very aggressive, particularly critical of the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism.”
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the more popular Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem watches, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with several new features: to the welcome screen and the interface revised and made less spartan, there are other more substantial such as the native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the standard.
Also pay attention to the interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the ability to import PDF files in the graphic processing module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combine the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with several hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during the review.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and are expected to release the final result in the coming weeks.
The English version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can also be sent to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a driving force for the spread in homes, it is precisely in the field of business that the Open Office suite attempts the big bet, already being able to count on several projects already realized in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of companies that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for corresponding Word videowriting; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulation presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are nearly 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
Another positive case at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third place and winner of the jersey of best climber.
The news is reported on the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive rider at Cera, the third generation EPO, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will meet the two years of disqualification canons.
The head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, confirmed that Kohl was positive at the third-generation EPO and told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positive.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka dot shirt of best climber.
IMMIGRATE: NEW YORK TIMES YES, IS ITALY RACISTIC?
Italy, "from a country of migrants, has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" who have been reluctantly welcomed.
Is this turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the "northern paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
In confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
This trend was underlined both by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of expensive rents up to 900 euros for a room
The housing market for university students is not in crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants’ union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now assumed very serious characters to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that the families of origin should support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that it triggers a process of generalized increase also for the residents".
In most cases, the lease offers also contain a series of violations: free, unregistered, no fee limit, sub-rents linked.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of the taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the detail of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room it goes from a minimum of 650 (Black Bands area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are asked for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move in peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you need 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students is more frequent, as in Perugia, there is finally a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee charged to foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic halls
The historic cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without movie theaters is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the large multi-sale and the consequent death by consumption of the mono-sale in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that appear to us inescapable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
Disappearing are often historical places and full of memory, "it is as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of the road and many emotions", observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and which told the poetry of a provincial theater and the nostalgia for a way of life.
The figures provided by Anec, the main traders' association, speak for themselves: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed their doors, and the biggest ones are the cinemas in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the ANEC, "it is useful that new structures are built but the survival of existing ones should be guaranteed, because when a city hall closes, not all its attendees are willing to move into the multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund in favor of traders: the state's previous debt is about 10 million euros.
It is disgraceful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect the existing laws.
To support the sector they would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about closures, decided to run away with the signing of a protocol between the City and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-room cinemas both in the historic center and in the suburbs.
Among the rules foreseen are tax relief measures in favor of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
"It is an initiative that I like", observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that to counteract the overpowering power of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have lived so many emotions shared, not to see the billboards blackened by dust I turn to the other side.
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to align the choices of the Municipality to the interests of the Piromalli Cossa."
The charges are heavy that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria address to the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in a mafia association.
In handcuffs also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, namesake of the boss, already convicted of association for mafia delinquents, condemned to compensate 10 million euros.
"In disregard of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been granted to the cossa - write the judges - to enter officially within the municipalities facilitating the already huge possibilities of control and address of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized underworld there are several" in his region: "There are areas where the intensity of the mafia is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean."
The arrests this morning follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli cossa.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved from the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected as the head of a center-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in the case the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having planned everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli cossa had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the ordered environmental interceptions against Dal Torrione, the prosecutors write, emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the cosca".
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones now come down in the field.
It is an endless field, occupying more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewables they’ve set their sights on, and now they’re trying to get their hands on, giants like Chevron.
The possibility of deriving energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, coinciding with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalists and the new increase in oil give momentum to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by swelling plants.
This amount would be twice that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Colossi on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in Northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies are betting on marine energy and have always been committed to traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesperson for a subsidiary of the US oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a good sign, especially considering that the U.S. continues to extract oil in Alaska and President Bush recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are taking the path of energy coming from the sea and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, indicate an increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now plants like the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which makes the buoys move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure drives a turbine, which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent ashore through submarine cables.
For now there are four such plants under design, awaiting only federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water when there are tides rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotary movement that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electricity Research, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others bordering the coasts, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and planned investments up to $35 million for 2009.
