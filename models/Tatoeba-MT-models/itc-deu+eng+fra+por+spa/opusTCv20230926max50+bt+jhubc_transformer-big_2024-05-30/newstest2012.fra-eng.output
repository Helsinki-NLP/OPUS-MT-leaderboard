Parliament did not ratify the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament rejected, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs rejected on second reading the draft amendment aimed at reducing the penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the door to freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for entering into an a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court is due to rule on the convicted woman’s appeal in December.
Tymosenko describes the ruling as political revenge of the regime and provoked a process of suspicions of bias of the court also in the west.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
The Libyan victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to be determined who will win.
As is customary in the region, the winners of the elections are Islamists, but whether they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary law of Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a robbery one cuts off one’s hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, the possible non-respect of the faith are punishable by capital punishment...
It is the Quran that will unite in the place of the personality of the dictator the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya such an order will reign as we cannot represent it and as surely we would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best, and would probably not be beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors accepted help with gratitude from unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who directed NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated at every attack.
When it comes to seeking out the victors in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our poilitics turned away from the dictator as a political ally without bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crusaders".
Without land use, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of self-interested protection of human rights.
As long as we prevent these adherents of Sharia from doing so.
A new era of crisis has begun.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states has published the GDP information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are looking not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistics offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries earlier published their economic development visions for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany ranked better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was at the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts expected.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnant during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter according to forecasts and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had forecast.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
The yield on ten-year bonds is 28.45%
The bond yields of Spain and Italy are climbing to critical limits.
The problems are starting to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% as the situation worsens in the region.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should be the guarantee of last resort .
The Czechs have qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate qualifying for 200 million
The football representation has achieved its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has dearly defended with a good share of luck in the second half and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to super Cech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification to the European Championship.
The Montenegras found themselves under pressure until the second part because of a precise Czech defense.
Victims of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football fund.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
Both teams had difficulty mounting combinations and the game was mainly centered around the center line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not come to break through the Czech defense that responded accurately to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan created a human shield Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Isfahan where uranium is processed.
They have thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest report that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at destroying Iran’s nuclear program, the targets would be not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: does not take breakfast and takes cold cuts for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight, 9% of schoolchildren are above average in weight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround him is.
On the tables of obese children, for example, sausages are found 50% more often than in families of normal-weight children.
19% of the obese had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In families of small big ones sport is also not a habit, which is now the case with most schoolchildren today - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Investigation of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third grade have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children who are overweight or even obese is the lack of proper diet and not enough physical exercise.
“Only half of the children surveyed say they eat for example breakfast five times a day – in case – lunch – snack – dinner, which is one of the basic principles of a good diet,” one of the results of the survey said.
No breakfast and cold cuts at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development requires some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students’ families eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
And the worst thing that has been reported is that one-tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
However, breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy french fries are consumed more often.
Almost every student – not to mention weight – drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned exercise regularly but for the parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diets based on possibilities proposed according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes are lots of cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is a great preference for sweet lemonades," the results of the survey said.
For lunch it was pasta that took the first place right in front of white meat.
The children did not want at all starchy and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Heading on health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a control of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session 'Obesity is not a coincidence', there was a well-determined desire to move towards a healthy diet," the results of the survey indicate.
The most striking was for example with regard to sweet lemonades because children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often checked on the questionnaire the white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce the sweet dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour or potato dumplings).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the dressing of the characters and a seminar on what happens on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "bored".
This time we have with the director Alenka (in the course there are no boys) dealt with how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, with no particular curve, another of overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically reduce wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus managed to highlight the character beautifully and also not to dress too prominently types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If there is, for example, a difference between the waist and the hips in such a way that the skirts or trousers do not pass at all, it is worth it to have it made to measure.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in one that permanently slips, wraps and does not hold up to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style clothing, with pieces of fabric sewn, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I am also afraid that given what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each intern was given a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into consideration the current appearance, the type of personality fashion as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress up"Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know from the campaign Victoria's Secret.
Deep down, it makes me happy, because it’s better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has gained almost a hundred pounds lately (don’t take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Also reflecting on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses the physical but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc ...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, has taken care of us of all this.
But this, until Sunday
The designer must have a general view
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse look to Saturday’s session filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka, fashion graphic designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with just one outfit differently.
For this example, variability is paramount.
As for example this trench coat that must be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with pumps and take a photo as a dress.
Or just roll up your sleeves or collar and immediately have a new look.
“Play with it,” he stressed.
But I especially appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"Then you can start to break it," Jakub said.
Finally I understand why you try to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines you sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have many more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for a fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I must be ready to "snip" at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality.
We have to rely on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of stylists remains chilly.
And known faces sometimes consider them as useless (it is enough for me to know something but what I look like goes to second place).
And if someone gets a styling from us, we must then rely on the fact that he dictates to us with a high probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one he actually has.
Then we only have to browse on google and make sure if the news of boulevard tells about the celebrity in question, if she has slimmed or grown etc...
Honza and Mario on Sunday put on our hearts that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he dresses and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not flatter yourself, keep your opinion.
“When a manager asks you to sort out her closet and fill it with new items, you can’t throw it all away and say, ‘Oh my God, what a horror.’”
“You’ll find a few things you’ll find pretty and he’ll advise you with what to wear,” Mario says.
This one showed us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It’s the one you hang around your waist and have on you for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, hair removal rollers or nanny pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large or worn.
So that we were not only people who listen but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, a fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We had no right to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently injure ourselves.
So we really need skills.
Mario was pleased when he congratulated me on my creation.
The account I'm reporting is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a short summary of what we learned during the second course weekend
I’m starting to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what they want.
The need for speed The Run is being fought across America.
Revision
Originally a run without problems is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do in a routine morning commute to work.
It fulfills to some extent the ambition of everyone but it is useless if no one wants to do something more.
The new subtitled part The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed racing series and release a kind of game from the playable games that would not count only with points.
So we were curious how the added passages will be when the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole thing pulls down because of a few unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught up in the adventure whose main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them starts to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then over 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on a different route and the planned stages in different environments that stand out quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also pretty even if the graphical technical level is the same as the previous series.
Well, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in addition from time to time embellished with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly decreases your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Alongside this, the different races are well arranged one after the other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments you strive to surpass the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you race against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then again you await another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police coming into the game and trying to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the out-of-vehicle passages.
Rather, it’s an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help them by tapping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is well like this because this element does not risk to hinder and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that embellish the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said that it is negative.
For realistic simulation you will have to go elsewhere.
But although we can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything is ok.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not yet at the point.
We don't expect this game to be complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, it's not completely good.
During tight overtakings you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy flights.
Or it ends up in crumbs.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you have broken your figure or you have gone out into the scenery the game brings you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used all 5 restarts you have to start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and the solution must be found by remembering the piece of route in question.
The big draw of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are certain turns that must be passed in a certain way otherwise it does not pass.
Otherwise you meet on a given place "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or one minute late.
What makes you angry is the situations when you see the opponent easily pass between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and bypass them or brake.
It does not matter if you go ahead of him because it is "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
Adversaries have other advantages.
During all the time of the game, you, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about the weather, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This annoys the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long deck in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a good number of times.
It can be understood that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adredalin,but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it doesn't matter if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is to change the car during the races.
You need to be careful about gasoline pumps on the routes because you can change cars there however most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American engines for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic features on highly technical roads, for example on laced roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main regime of the story.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock themselves:
This one connects online with the Autolog function which among other things compares your results with those of other players and gives you other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult strokes to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a subway train that sends the car directly to the scrap.
At the editorial board we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about creating this game or whether the authors really think we are idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra,but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is bothering is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer useful.
The sound part is good and the track is to choose from.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the most young audience a new soundtrack has been created in the style "I mix everything", but we can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
Overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is really confusing.
If the game didn’t have those stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The fun is really good but be prepared for faults to hit you in the eye with the force of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs Behaving Like Negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a tough war.”
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," Miléna Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various EU bodies and their relations in such an understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers at the Charles University Law School might envy her, she showed how much she takes her motto "understandably and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
“From the beginning, there was criticism that he’s faded, that he’s a leatherback, that he can’t fulfill any mission, and I have to say that he took everyone’s breath away because he holds his role to perfection.”
“He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe.”
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "To what phone number should I call?", thus as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater legibility of the Union's policy vis-à-vis states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also referred to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency as successful two years ago.
The Czechs either resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
It called the fall of the government very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has reached its peak" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved now.
In addition, we must approve the new seventh budget of the Union, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
Since it would seem that the budget will be thin and for savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the framework of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a comprehensible Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted pickles, bananas differently large or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky.
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, she said, stemmed from a number of factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a cover letter and weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, that Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group from Visegrad still doing?' and he's not happy at all."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future, tough new rules on fiscal policy await the Member States.
This is the concept of a Europe with two speeds, if not several speeds, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
“We have countries in the eurozone and others outside the eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation."
In the first place it was said that the countries that want to cooperate with each other and those that do not want to stay in their corner.
"There will be a lot of institutes of this type and there will be a really two-speed Europe," Vicenova expects.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to establish the basis on which all issues having an impact on the EU should be debated between all EU members and not only eurozone members.
History of a brand:
IBM Innovator Begins the Second Century of Its Existence
If someone were to look for the word that most closely expresses the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long term".
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The foundation for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm’s first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a lot of global problems can be solved as long as people are willing to think.
His slogan "THINK!" became the imprint around which the life of a future giant would develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the basis of Watson's carefully crafted company culture.
For us IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it has always remained true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change all the others around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more"said for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the thirties, began to take care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - the IBM people were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid vacations, employer-paid insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and traders.
In the same way, IBM has a well-developed system of customer relations.
At first, the company was great at discovering talent – as one of the first firms to abolish all forms of discrimination and thus had a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman – Virginia Rometty – who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has worked at IBM for 30 years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing what is called jamy, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
No wonder he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a secure position in the business field.
“From the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor of economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology,” added Geogre Colony of Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is commonly called in the United States in view of its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest firms in the world.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of products from server to nanotechnology.
It holds numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are, for example, the ATM, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the floppy disk.
IBM was the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year with $220 billion (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
It is not all the innovations and manufactures that have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example has not succeeded in betting on a clean operating system OS/2, the Prodige service online or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on the movement ahead you can’t emotionally stay hooked on the past,” notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it leaves.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor that basically stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a predominant place.
However still in 1990 it was with more than half participation the strongest hardware representative.
From the year 2000 IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during this three-year period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of outlook technologies.
It continues in investment and even from 2008, when for the first time it overcame the new financial crisis.
IBM is negotiating according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
Does it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM share has progressed from 2008 to a rocket of 120 percent, the net profit of the company continues to grow.
The logo of IBM is to change everything but not its values.
For this reason, we can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was renamed IBM in 1924 - originally a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointing machines", the clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competitor firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that the identity and culture of the company so far rest.
Watson ran the firm until 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson’s tenure, revenue multiplied to $9 million, and the firm’s expansion into all parts of the world began.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of management it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that defined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded at IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
As far as the field of commerce is concerned, IBM recently developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps salespeople manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for the future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner"explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova summer asylum in her home, she had no idea that her couple would not last.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not push back the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
Over time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova are separated there will be no wife to welcome him at the door of the house.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out.”
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova said, showing that she has detached herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I’ll stay with Iveta and I won’t change.”
“My wife set up a paper marriage and I respect it.”
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we talk in a completely normal way but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop it.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where she’s going, who she’s with, and if she’s having an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility," concluded Joseph.
Women’s Worst Vices: Does It Affect You Too?
If you ask men to determine the typical vices of women, all, one as well as the other, are able to pull them "out of their sleeves".
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of female vices that manage to pump the blood from the veins of men.
The purchases
Does your half make remarks that you are addicted to shopping?
Should you buy at least one piece of clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy and in packages at the time of sales?
In your case we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, who would resist the shop window of clothing stores, to look for himself pretty clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become for the man a real hell.
Just remember how many times you have told your spouse that he or she is waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I would need to lose at least 5 kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me?"
Doesn’t that phrase remind you of something?
Is it?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints are, the more poisonous women become.
The odds and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless ride.
Wash the windows, vacuum, clean the floors, dust, strip the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have dirty the sink, soiled the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can, however, ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put this worn-out suit in the trash."
"Are you going to put on those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this job on your partner this way several times a day, you will really break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Perhaps if men knew, women would not have to do so much undermining work.
Defamation, persiflation
Defamation, persiflation but also insults against someone are also typical of some women.
Women are particularly drawn to relationships and thus are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets out a little harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is, however, a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persevere, even despise others and are for their entourage - especially at work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey forward Jagr twice participated in Philadelphia's victory during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again at the top of the productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made one more pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
After the match Jagr told reporters from across the Atlantic that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
“I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick.
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal on the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes goals for the pallet and presented it to goalkeeper Maxime Talbot.
One second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t mean he’s the best player in the league but he’s really one of the top three,” Jagr said of his center.
“I never thought I’d play at the end of my career with a hockey player like him.”
“I’m really happy with that.”
“I want to play on him.”
"All these years in the NHL the other players of the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match as with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended up two to one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit the pallet, I took some speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the last goal of the match from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he went out in the second third because of an injury in the upper body.
The Candians did not hold up to an experienced defender their two-goal lead lost after a 2:3 penalty shot.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that mostly annoyed the local coach rather than lost fists as they played the match only with 5 defenders.
"That sucks."
“We played the match only with an experienced player, the rest were young people.
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement over replacement that wasn't enough and we couldn't resist."
“We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our zone.”
For that we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender, took part in the thirtieth attack on Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How Travel Prices Have Changed Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays to East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a tilt to the west and trips to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not permitted for citizens of the socialist bloc (also for Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of socialist countries.
In the event that the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West however you had to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good acquaintance" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency agreement that was the condition for traveling west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was however not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
The travels of the Czechs have since 1989 experienced a great revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at the maximum, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million holiday days in countries around the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of the Yugoslavia of the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in western neighbouring countries led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a boarding house.
The typical trait of a Czech trip at that time was to take with you your own canned food, sausage, etc... to save money.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average salary have increased which caused another important moment around the year 1997.
Thanks to an increasing demand for travel travel agencies have started since 1997 to prepare tours with routes by air charters which thanks to contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what there was before.
At the end of the 90s the Czechs had visa-free connections with practically most developed countries around the world except the US which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. removed visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to rank completely in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for a holiday abroad including ancillary charges. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President but this may end in a situation without solution "one pat"
Czech football has been without a president for nearly five months and there is a risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Czech Football Association will not be known after another General Assembly to be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting rules to proceed with.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in Czech football management.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek did football go back to divergences between the Association's chambers that could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16 when a new president had to be chosen.
Delegates from the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation remained stalled and there was not even talk of how to elect.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or also the officials with full powers.
In this one point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the assistance also of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There are still disagreements about the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also contributed nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the issue remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the bed.
"The apple of discord lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model wins in the third round the candidate who has received the most votes as a percentage in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to be withdrawn so that the candidate who will have received the highest percentage of votes from both houses will win.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the votes.
"Only then would it lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda who understands the objections of the Moravian party and according to which it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Paclik also agrees, even though he believes that the election rules established according to the statutes benefit Pelta the most among all the candidates.
"I hope that we vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet some sneaky ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
"Today's possible qualifying for the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more enthusiasm for cooperation," adds the officer from Jablonec who among the three has the greatest experience in football management both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"It's not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the rules of drawing."
"This can cause a blockage in the General Assembly again."
"I still hope that sound reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell if the entire football direction will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee to the ground for retaliation.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to welcome the torn parties into the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to fight for the post of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asks for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be put on campaign for this high office.
“If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I don’t run for election.”
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent Pelta from becoming head of the AFRT, which would a priori be favored for this election.
Paclik also stresses that if he wins the elections he will hold this position of President only until 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see in the position an experienced and high-level manager who is not related to the world of football.
“I’ve talked to people who would have the profile,” he says.
"For me it was terrible when some people told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at this time."
“I would like to change that image,” he added.
What is said to be especially embarrassing to Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of controversial fame who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to occupy this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, it would be even less favorable for football," Paclik said.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was uttered a few years ago during wiretaps in the context of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta got away without any penalty.
“I don’t know what prestige Pelta would bring to football.”
"And how would we be regarded in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," Paclik said, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I will sell the club from Plzen".
If Paclik wins Thursday’s vote, he should prove he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been backed by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with."
“He has great capabilities.”
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able."
"I'm not putting my nose in what I don't know," Paclik said, drawing great attention in September when he voted for the annulment of the Arbitration Committee with Ludek Macela, replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to run private firms and that he also runs since last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sports and to bring a certain culture to it.”
"I would curb the influence of certain interested groups that tend to, for example, influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Board, which leads to situations of bad taste," Paclik added, who does not seek his antipathy for Sparta chief Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power with high-level politicians would allow for more money from the gambling tax for sport.
“This is one of the key issues that the new president should address.”
“If it’s about the gambling tax as political parties say, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT president should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"That's not ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my Plzen club actions to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to bed situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidate Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future the quarrels about the rules for the elections.
The Jablonec official is ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believes that the success today of the football representation should calm this gueguerra before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which did not take place, promised to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial means if elected.
He decided to run at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay could allow him to defend his vision of football management and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and waiting for a president on Thursday.”
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the lead of the Association," he adds, but he is above all connected with the club of Jablonec, has worked a lot of years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election lies a euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly statutes were approved which were not perfect as all have realized."
"If there weren't all these different interpretations, we would have had a president since September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that caught the attention of the delegates.
“If I become president, I take it as a personal mission and I’m ready to take full responsibility for it in case it doesn’t work.”
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he endeavors, it is said, not to confront his adversaries.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl, whom he recognizes in view of his training in law, and that he is well aware that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has also not attacked for a long time Tonas Paclik who on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been playing in football for a year and he's already had some success."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta told his opponent, but he remained faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to national representation.
It should be a staple of football.
"And I would also endeavor to finish all the business that begins with the Bohemian one or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sectors so that we can get enough money for all football," the 46th candidate told Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring about any change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov where there is understandable nervousness since there is no leadership.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he thinks the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“If there’s a single point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round, we’ll get past it.”
“Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there’s a new leader at its head,” Pelta said optimistically two days before the day likely to determine his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday it would not please many people, it seems.
Rajchl promises, however, that if he is elected, he will begin to work hard.
He wants systemic changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different fields of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I want to take care of football as a whole.
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and high-performance youth football."
“But I’m not saying I’ll do all this alone,” Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members takes care of a specific area."
“And I will be distributing difficult missions for football to take a big step forward.”
“A lot of people won’t be happy because it’s going to be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others,” he added.
He stated, it is said, that he would not run as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, I know I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know if it’s worth it and if I’ll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubt on each of my actions,” he said.
“A lot of people have told me that I shouldn’t give up because they’d give up too.”
“It’s a trust that I can’t betray,” he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“For the last two years there has been a lot of de facto work and I don’t want to let it go.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return to the way it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something that Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
“Behind him are people who would do football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen.”
“I can be blamed for a number of things, but certainly not for putting up with anyone.”
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to play football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would end up in the first division."
"There would be no situation like currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
“I constantly feel support from the Czech House who elected me as their Vice-President and know that with me there will be successes,” Rajchl said, who is considering saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, contract negotiations with television and on the gambling law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footballer would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
"No one can doubt in Plzen that he has done a great job this year."
"If elected he would surely continue in what was begun by Hasek and would not make any noticeable change among the people in the Commissions."
“He wouldn’t want to spoil his successes,” said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
UFO optics paddling pools, magnificent Budapest pools: Whoever travels across Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after touring the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in sparkling water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the last 18 months, there’s one item she shouldn’t miss in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Stretched on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that were waiting for her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor pool pleased her, she would immediately note in her notebook all the details of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Bathing Joys). Municipal indoor pools of Munich, historic bathing palaces in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true devotee of bath culture.
Meder, explains that she does not have much interest in the sport but he feels attracted to the water in a totally different way.
It’s irritating that swimming fans should be content with staring at blue tiles and accommodating themselves with the stink of bleach while joggers breathe in the bewitching scent of spruce forests or can listen to the sighing of the park’s cheerful birds.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools should always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dive in a pool and the volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more effort, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor you have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a worthwhile 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to take a leap in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Alongside the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cavern in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálftürd).
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views.While from a rooftop of the Zürich bath you have the whole city in your sights, you can admire the snow-covered Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal rise towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of bleach does not emanate from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a sulfur smell, from the <0xC3><0x81>rpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong oil smell, which it is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded lot.
The bath designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
Looking through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the growth of weeds between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Bad Wildbad Bath Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; we can discover not only neo-Roman elements that come out since its design in 1844 but also a Moorish room in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because she is from Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a beautiful performance to merge such different building styles into such a formidable unit,” Meder says.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its commodity speculation?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation into the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that stock market speculation on global commodities pushes prices up and banks share a complicity in the global famine.
The consumer protection campaign aligns itself concretely against the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Speculation on commodities was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that bettors have detached themselves from offers and demand - and profit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from U.S. competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "no case is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report allegations.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of directors of Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode hailed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way, how much the banks of today are harming the public interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio for which money has been invested in food speculation," Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it’s about the hungry people or if the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is at stake.”
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his duties.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman of the board of directors will not change anything to what is planned within the board of directors.
It could improve its brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would terminate commodity investments.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which on November 7 and 8 the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires to 1001 people.
Only eleven percent found it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank’s clients would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to those around them, with 49 percent responding that they would consider terminating their account to change banks.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that Moved
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and serves as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, glass sheds, bright and bold looks and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the World's Fair in Brussels in 1958 is a good example of this.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its light and suspended steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to this day as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian World's Fair.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His project of pavilion as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the train station of the south of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang works of art, so not a good environment.
However it was used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has deteriorated more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "House of the 21st century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvedere museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect.
The new start was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, who promoted an art historian to a considerable career among other things in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she particularly carried out the work of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a cafe and a bookstore are located there, and an office is to be built there.
Strict monitoring, low budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensibly transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following his travel to Vienna and by its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was "a pit of energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was laid and the roof replaced with a special safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements have made way for the new farm, a dimmed light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the lightweight Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remained, the house is painted in a protective shade against rust of red-brown color.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also please the office of protection monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, “which came from Brussels,” said Krischanitz recently, a typical “Drop-in-the-City” story.
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a lucky shot of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the newly planned "quarter of the central station", with offices and apartments.
And maybe another stroke of luck will happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city in order to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a million-dollar winter crisis package.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in the winter.
The number of employees is expected to double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend in this regard more than 70 million more this year.
The daily Bild-Zeitung reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments totalling about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the event of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway installations and platforms is expected to double and increase to 16,000 people.
The goal is to clear the docks of snow and ice by the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track devices required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Railway Station Manager Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference about train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a great deal of problems with the transport of passengers, because, among other things, it lacks reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been awaiting approval from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had a lot of work to do for years, as it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked much more often at the workshop, after an axle break occurred on an ICE at the Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the US: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine amounting to millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not enough, the past of this giant of the sector catches up with it in the USA: the Frankfurt institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA financial market regulator has brought a series of charges against large banks for inciting cooperative banks to make false promises about buying financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost tremendous value during the financial crisis and drove the banks down.
"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution to this without the parties having to start a court proceeding," a Deutsche Bank spokesperson in New York said.
In comparison, the Bank did not admit any wrongdoing.
The same is true for Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks aside and in the summer he assigned to the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As far as the issue of mortgage documents is concerned it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
The credit unions are at the base.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years old, at the moment there is a stormy wind blowing on the American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous appeals to seek redress or to sanction breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It blames 18 major international banks, U.S. state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for taking advantage in kind in mortgage deals of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA for several transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without citing a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank dismissed the claims as unwarranted and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett to grow 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, invests colossal sums in IBM’s IT business.
Since March, it has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett explains constantly not to invest in IT companies, given that the long-term evolution of companies only suggests bad forecasts.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his view on investments in this sector.
He already had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knightly attack on the world of finance.
As a result, the IBM IT business now has the right to call itself "Mr. IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he has been buying IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway became a major shareholder of IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM has never heard of this commitment so far.
He congratulated management, which even during the economic crisis had secured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time been focusing on lucrative IT services as an operating accounting center.
The IT pioneer, more than 100 years old, offers both Software and consulting as well as high-performance business computers.
Buffett had so far rather avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in the companies he understands the business of.
But on the contrary, Buffett is attacking rail freight, lubricant or machine manufacturers.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries and shares in a number of major groups such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich-based Rück.
The 81-year-old octogenarian had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and raised it to one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
Following the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM shares rose 1 percent on the stock exchange.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, has a total market value of more than $220 billion and has Apple and Microsoft among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn’t want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable.
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now be reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist background.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks, the specter that had long been thought dead has reappeared: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable with this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany has never been mentioned.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology", "Such was the title of the Internet publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The Sabah newspaper points out that one of the authors was a v-man of the Constitution Protection, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany has reasonably responded by calling this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that cohabitation was staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports by some Turkish media have the effect of a slap in the face: "Germany's 50th anniversary gift" is the title of an article on the Turkish platform "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Therefore, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of univocal conditions.
"it begins to puer", This is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
He points out that people were allegedly murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and these had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it hasn’t come to the mind of German authorities much earlier to do research in some suspected far-right circles, the authors are surprised.
More than one is ready for at least rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be sloppy, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defense and armaments."
"It will be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," Selen wrote.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in jeopardy, the Mölln and Solingen attacks in the 1990s explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance through acts of violence could lead.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past, it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks that the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population was producing.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax burdens.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many Germano-Turks towards the local rule of law has been since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and reassess far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Lake Zurich Scandal Bank
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has nearly gone bankrupt in the financial crisis and in the meantime patinates from one crisis to the next.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; it was known in July, that he would occupy in 2013 an almost as spectacular position: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, hailed; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently achieved solidity and passed kind comments on future colleagues.
"UBS has succeeded in the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the Bank’s security systems and ignited about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the president of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered to be suffering - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the board presidency already in May - not 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
At once he assumed responsibility for a bank’s strategy, which has proved once again that it has long since earned the title of “Europe’s biggest scandal bank”.
Indeed, UBS is on one side huge – until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other, it has been skating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing, it seems, spares the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, she had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with 1.6 billion dollars more money coming from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
"In the current perspective, one wonders: how could I have just been so wrong?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, who was hitherto considered a top intellectual as well as a genius banker.
A few months later, it was revealed why he had left.
The division of the bank had flared up with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this it did find investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was silenced, to the point that one never even learned its name.
But that was only the first shot.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank was due to announce billions in losses again, with board chairman Marcel Ospel, who was still Switzerland's second-highest-paid board in 2006, pulling out.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its investment mistakes, in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - for it noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to shelter from such large banks.
Finally, the UBS 2007 balance sheet totaled more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“We were not able to save UBS once again,” says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second one followed.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the affluent clientele, who had defrauded the tax possibly with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS more or less published that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the Board of Directors and the chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
In just a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment because of bad speculation and asset management because of tax evasion aid.
And, as there was a return to some calm, and as was thought, that the UBS would get away with it, it followed this unfortunate story of stock traders: a single stock trader flaming 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it is published: with risk management in investment banking it still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, we could see that the control of risks has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
So the chief financial officer of a major German bank is sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have control of the risks in hand."
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long since assumed their function, that of becoming guardians of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the strong cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here among the Swiss traditional shops as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the Credit Suisse Palace to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has at one time or another been removed from the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, he finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And yet, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country with seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," author Lukas Hässig writes in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks concluded a huge group together.
A bank was set up, which was already too big for small Switzerland - and has been growing steadily.
What helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich, but lethargic bank with assets management in Zurich as a strong point and a poorer, but certainly already more strongly internationalized one.
Suddenly, the international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who gets along very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has made his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli until the end.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought his models were reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders during which the head of the Wuffli group has always pronounced the same slogan: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of currencies and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
The business advisors, who had the responsibility, pointed out, however, a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS would have shortcomings in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost it its life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in American sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packed and rolled over valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages – but has also retained risks.
Even when other banks have long sought to come down.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” Geiger said.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and are so far bankable.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: put an end to investment banking, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t want to (yet) go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as this is clear so far.
Next Thursday, bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only supposed to be temporary when the bank broke up with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has established himself: he must conduct the business of the UBS in a sustainable way, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of play of the mid-1990s.
It will cut 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He has only said publicly so far that he and his wife were going to look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market

Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: “It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis,” he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was from his point of view too early to invest in bonds coming from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the winds and entered the American technology industry.

Smart Crows Spread to Cities
In many places, frexes are considered a "bird problem" but experts say that these very intelligent animals have not been hunted from cities for a long time.
Some like them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the residents are multiplying because of the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt the frexes of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
The protectors of nature based the problems of the cities also on the exodus of the particularly protected freux: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, arranging and felling typical hatching trees made life difficult for birds.
Crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity because of the crow slaughter in this region.
Critics have found catching birds in traps and killing them with particularly brutal sticks.
"Normal eviction, eviction, is useless," Leer city and landscape planner Werner Klöver said.
Destruction of nests using pressurized water or cutting down trees often produces undesirable consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg said.
“Animals are moving away, large colonies are dividing, and they are dispersing in other places.”
Expulsion is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
“We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them.”
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the expulsion of animals to aversive conditioning and eye-catching offers, in order to allow them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens prospected "info panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with the: "We can finally better withstand a pimple on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-Travel-educational baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent friars.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of noise caused by birds: "Here's a lot of communication, those birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: The friars not only use working instruments to arrive at a feast but they themselves manufacture their tools as working instruments.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge were testing four freux recently, just how far the intelligence of birds is coming.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to crush a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they firmly recognized that a stone must have certain size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning crows then had to solve a more messy problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their loot with their beak.
However, the researchers had made pieces of wire available to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four brothers succeeded even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo wins Portugal in 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks suddenly remained unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the qualifiers for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and knocked out Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal went awry against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and perfected, after the 0:0 of the match, its fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the knockout return match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first inning (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also more hot in the 0:0 draw between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) release against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-meter penalty played by hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) have twice made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick of 30 meters in advance in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his distance shooting qualities and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosniaks, who did nothing in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance thanks to forward Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship of Manchester City initiated a head ball directed towards the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33th).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech
Finally the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attentions.
After an attack against Helder Postiga during the Bosnia penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other side, Stark conceded an 11-metre penalty played at the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European runner-up managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go for a fifth time to the EM.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had luck and had to survive a shock moment in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech reflexly blocked a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the cross had to come to the rescue of the world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs already shot down, once again, the striker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb during this time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to abandon his seat on the bench in the 2002 MS third, the Croatians were able to look forward to their fourth round in the European Championship final.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the post, attacking Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to VfL Wolfsburg's Mario Mandzukic, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd Minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the pitch.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken over with a 4:0 success the first stage for a preliminary decision, 32 Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) tied for visitors.
Ireland pushed to the top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment that the defence of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the first-scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was within reach and squeezed the ball into the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly," announced CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on an equitable basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this rapidly expanding country.
Growth plans in China are also an important element of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase revenues by 2015 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion.
Last year, the Walldorfer recorded a revenue of nearly 12.5 billion euros.
Currently the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked as well.
SAP has been active in China for over 20 years.
“Now, we want to expand our activities ...,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, backed by comprehensive information.”
The Personal Mass Slaughter
Peter Englund's new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a long list of characters that holds your heart.
A tip to get started: Carefully tear this page apart and make it your bookmark.
In this novel by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written here an unusual book which he accurately describes as "a work of anti-history."
It has a few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; hardly any ambassadors or discussions on strategies and materials are found.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he says, as a "book describing what it might look like," with "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
"Beauty and Sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, paramedics and vendors.
Some will become heroes.
Others are prisoners of war, some will lose limbs, go crazy, or lose their lives.
Their lives falter here like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are rekindled.
Peter Englund’s book deviates from traditional history books.
He denies the idea that the First World War can only be summed up in the terrible trench warfare on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skilfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is exciting from the very first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Katrina hurricane that stinks of cordite.
When gunshots sound in the distance, and you’re a housewife, do you stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been compounded by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nanny in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly taken from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most address deprivation and the ability to get away with it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
He describes “meat made from cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles.”
It states that "837 substitute meats allowed are registered in the sausage production. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive for savagery and declares about war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable armchair, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with no beard behind your civilization, and that's not the case.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is in great danger of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
“When you resign yourself to sacrifice, you hope to have an audience,” he writes.
Sadly, this is rather comparable to “a convicted man strangled in secret.”
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“Conflict is increasingly becoming a story of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He sees the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as there is heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"There is the most grotesque expression in the gonorrhea-related pus trade, which soldiers buy and spread over the genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital," he wrote.
“The most desperate people apply it to their eyes, which results in blindness for life.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he sees how the war "triggered forces exclusively uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People begin to wonder why their leaders are waging war on them.
The best World War I works are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's Great War and Modern Memory, or Erich Maria Remarque's Nothing New in the West, rather than complete.
The work of Peter Englund is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if it came out of his book, grabbed by your hands this page with the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first misstep, a meticulously planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be the most empty.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers and others informed from the outset that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, with his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not have been rehearsals of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which went against the department’s rules and spawned a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean up Zuccotti Park from its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the development of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island, with a view to the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots — counter-terrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police quickly — to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move around the park came “at the last minute,” said a regular, referring to the operation as “a simple exercise.”
"The few police officers I know who were called didn't know they were going to Zuccotti Park," the person said on condition of anonymity.
"The only ones who know they're going there are at the top of the police department's hierarchy."
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighborhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people came and went to the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was necessary to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
Lights and recorded messages from loudspeakers appeared to intimidate protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park wearing their light blue windshields, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were touched before 1:45 am, police said, leaving time for the occupants to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said the move was taken solely for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, rudely detained by the officers.
Browne said television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture footage.
As police moved west across the protesters’ thickly cluttered business, including luggage, plastic lawn and sheet bags filled with clothes, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away. The images were posted on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the camp's epicenter clung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Mostly for “disturbance of public order and rebellion”.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the highest-ranking officer to have found himself on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead the operations," Browne said.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street to the south.
We have seen the police expand the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them armed with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen crushing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood emerged while flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The union of school assistants sues the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of schoolchildren who lost their jobs last month, plans to file a lawsuit Wednesday in the city for unnecessary and discriminatory redundancies, with a disproportionate impact on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, 37th District Council, in an attempt to have the layoffs reversed.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees, among the city's lowest-paid, lost their jobs last October 7, and union leaders compared the layoffs to political revenge for not allowing the city access to a health care fund run by workers' groups that would have closed the budget gap last spring.
Municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget that closed in June.
One member of the Council responded, noting that layoffs of school aid were not specified in the budget.
37th District Council officers said they would fill out a notice of claim, warning the education department that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's Department of Education will be the defendant. The plaintiffs will be represented by eight redundant workers, all black or of Latin American descent, like most school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of redundancies in schools in the city’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 schoolchildren lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the Southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight schoolchildren at Harlem’s 36 Public School, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution says “It’s not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget gap.”
The 36 public school budget was cut by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each underprivileged student enrollment.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo used the term "overshoot" to describe the action, although "overshoot" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six coordinators of parents have been dismissed", and "not only because of overshooting".
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on Libya issue
In the end, it would seem that the Republicans and Democrats had reached an agreement at the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will take a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage."
“This resolution is about honoring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It's bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties clashed, as well as with the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not approving the U.S. military role in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But the same day the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure aimed at reducing funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission thus remained in a form of legislative purgatory — Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his foot.
Congressional indecision has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee’s resolution “congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide legislators as it did last June?
Senator and Commission Chair Richard D. Lugar (Independent) objected to the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Congressional Republicans, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment related to the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to pass their amendments, but they have tried.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled in Congress on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations from a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters - notably new Republicans who want to donate their resumes - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August called for the House and Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose it.
As eager as the members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slowed down from the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
“Massacred but not beaten,” Gabrielle Giffords said in her first TV interview since the shooting.
Ten months after a gunman shot him at close range in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared Monday night on a television show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover first and foremost rather than return to Congress.
When she appeared on ABC's "20/20" alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show addressed his difficult comeback following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, passing through his head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and called her recovery “difficult.”
After Diane Sawyer asked how she was feeling, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords responded "pretty well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of “20/20,” aired the day before the release of the couple’s new book entitled “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special program traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair as doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos released by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with doctors, said she does not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and first asked for information about the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
“There have been a lot of deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Upon her recovery, Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
“So I’d say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t beaten,’” Kelly said.
You just got slaughtered.
And you'll get through it, recover and come back stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for New York City’s homeless veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie-suits stood at his feet to cheer him.
“The military, men and women, are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military figure at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, chief of staff of the U.S. military, saw the role of troops differently.
“They were presented as a kind of orphan,” the high-ranking military official wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that. I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it was pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have developed between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public is increasingly acting as if they are sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
“But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits.”
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not wish to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about mercy take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect as they faced insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if “an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were interviewing him were subtly asking if he would be able to keep up with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after he returned from the fight.
"When you approach the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian as he speaks to his sons.
The military’s difficulties arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely praised by a country so unfamiliar with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as we did in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people largely focus on the depth of a military’s suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost, or the extent of injuries.
The military faces growing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the military for alleged inaction regarding rapes.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It was an alarm signal,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan put aside his concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I've got my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman’s room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her on the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, on Nov. 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still on duty and some not, will eagerly await the court ruling at a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether a lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the spread of rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the military did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke declares that she is attacking the military, because the problem starts with them.
“The military is a vertical structure,” she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future prosecutions.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will bring several lawsuits, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on or off duty for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
"The alleged misconduct is inherent in the complainants' military service," the documents said.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is only inscribed on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely solely masculine.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in getting in touch with local women.
Out of these two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives – two-thirds in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize," said Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three more trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America non-profit foundation is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network, a group for the rights of women in the military.
His group filed a lawsuit in December with the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way they handle claims for benefits for people who report having been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine separate bills were introduced to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were prosecuted - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
Complainants in the Susan Burke case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the fact.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell different police officers, doctors and commanders about her rape 11 times in detail.
She underwent a “rape kit” (literally a rape kit), and her abuser’s blood – due to a cut in her arm – was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was seated before a judge at a trial during which she was questioned about her sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier in the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was delivered,” Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after court."
“I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commander, ‘This wasn’t his trial but mine.’”
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
“Whether the Lyman case and the other plaintiffs will move forward or not is a long story,” said John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington’s Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction stands between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents posed by responsibility.
"The odds are against them... but it's important that they try," he added.
These things change only when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial doesn't turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the military on this issue as long as there is no reform," she said.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a mere guy sharing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being caught in a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, faced his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time leading up to the attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to find them,” said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by DEMOS’ think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is packed with so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific precision — the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. They targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions asked were about their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their own optimism about their own future.
By getting in touch with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, youth and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen.”
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new must-have tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues such as social trends, through likes, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three contents per day, the “data supernova” generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research papers whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you could not approach on the street.
“Before, when you tried to conduct investigations into people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have let you in,” Bartlett said.
“Facebook avoids all of this – you have direct access to their information.”
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their exploits while drunk were much more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that students’ colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, said in a statement.
“We know how to identify at-risk children who would otherwise not be recognized.”
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied statistics regarding the love situation and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey that they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, it’s a completely different thing online.
“I don’t think a lot of users have ever thought that a researcher could study their profile,” said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the Knowledge Lab in London, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students’ Facebook walls.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,” Selwyn said.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and pen are still the best tools one can use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
“Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect – and social is not in front of a computer.”
"Cold and Inhuman": First appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two bombings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance fighter” during his first appearance at the Oslo trial.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars,” he said in front of a courtroom filled with 500 people.
“As for the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it, because you hold your mandate as an organization that supports an ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, speak to the victims’ parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for an additional 12 weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to be sure he would be put behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhumane," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television channel NRK.
“I wasn’t comfortable, but I personally made some progress after seeing and hearing the suspect.”
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, looking journalists and survivors in and out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast “resistance” movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
So the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but it's not," a relative of a victim said.
"It would have been much easier."
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview at the Movies This Week
After Steve Jobs’ death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford – distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in a recent interview with Steve Jobs that will air this week in the first part of a movie on major markets, is how much that creative mind had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a flowchart improver - a man who believed that many business executives were suffering from a "disease that lets them think that a great idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of great work separates a handbook from a great idea.
In 1995, Bob Cringley developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traces the birth of the computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years since Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringley is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video was found in the director’s garage.
This video, slightly uplifted, is the basis of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in cinemas on Wednesday and Thursday next.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs weighs his thoughts clearly, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems eager to hear Cringley’s questions, giving him elbows to speed him up and move on to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, we find a strangely insightful aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision on the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He then explains them and then puts them into practice.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable Lost Interview sequences:
On how he learned to run a business:
“All these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why are you doing things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs goes on to elaborate on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" assessed by the nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated plant that guaranteed accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a round to the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the “Blue Box” he created with Steve Wozniak – a device that was used to hack phone networks and make free long-distance phone calls.
The device has been the subject of many writings beforehand, but Steve Jobs’ euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a pay phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We’d wrap the ball around different things half a dozen times and you’d scream in the pay phone and it’d happen a minute later on the pay phone next door,” Jobs said, laughing.
“We were young and with this Blue Box we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn't both know much, but we invented a little thing that could control great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to tell a wonderful story that he and Wozniak have devised: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go insane laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett’s drive):
At the age of 12, on the hunt for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP’s employees to visit the company’s research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first desktop computer ever designed.”
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a small cathode-ray tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
The Improvisation of Innovation:
At several points in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim.
Early in his career, as he sets up to sell some PCBs, a client asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working for only 30 credit days, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that proved incredibly reliable.
On large companies that are running out of steam:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you worked at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then what?”
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are the types of people] who end up leading companies and product specialists are put away from decision-making.
The genius in product that led to this position of monopoly is completely rotted by people who can’t imagine designing a good product versus a bad product – the manual work required.
This is what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire IT industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They wrestled defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge piece of manual work separates a great idea from an outstanding product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to be made...Some things you can’t do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made for personal taste. It's about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring those things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
That's part of what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who just proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas Dinner with Adversaries of Health Law as Court Gathers
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the issue of political discord, whether opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference aimed at discussing petitions for consideration.
One of the cases involved a lawsuit brought by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5.30 am is expected next March, and the result will likely be likely to favor the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming by the time the court’s decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue for the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor-general of the United States during the George W. Bush administration.
Clément’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen law firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among them was Mitch McConnell, a top Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health law.
The star guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers of law-related and other organizations even though the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appearing on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court follows the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“The judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.”
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dispels any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for critics claiming that they too easily mix court cases with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general solicitor for the Obama administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the level of the court of first instance.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing Records $18 Billion Order for Commercial Aircraft
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, two-aisle airliners, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated to be worth more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order for 50 of its products.
It is, on the other hand, quite a case when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Equally incredible is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing reported the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777s.
It was the Dubai-based airline Emirates that placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, raising the total order amount to $26 billion.
Boeing said on Monday that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel and convenience savings for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than a billion dollars.
“This is clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So they not only have the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so detrimental to them since the country would make money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point as these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or delay their aircraft orders as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural risk coverage,” he said.
Emirates’ order reinforces Boeing’s dominance in the large aircraft market and helps curb the attempted encroachment of Airbus competitor with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s win at the aerospace show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the larger version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing back its debut to boost momentum as customers demand to increase its load capacity and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Clearly Defeated in Michoacán Elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the run for governor.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister appears to have lost her attempt to gain access to Michoacán’s governorship in violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of this western state.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the entire country,” Luisa Maria Calderon told radio during an interview Monday after the election.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral agents... They seized the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he is organizing his return, and a win in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out from Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate from his brother’s conservative party, the Action Nationale Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureole also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any link to drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence persisted.
A week before the elections a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to help the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would hamper the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the managing director of the Manila-based BASD, said the world’s two fastest-growing economic powers must “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all in this crisis together.”
“So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia can be protected to some extent but it is not safe.”
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has dangerously skyrocketed and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The burgeoning sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked fears that the global economy may enter recession, and has prompted calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Nag foresaw that the IMF would channel any Asian aid, but he also said that bilateral assistance — like buying bonds from the U.S. bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund — offered greater negotiating power to Europe’s Asian partners.
India’s Trade and Industry Minister, Anand Sharma, said “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from a drop in exports and a depletion of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and agitated,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help wealthy Europeans while facing their own significant economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get the 1.2 billion Indians, at least 800,000 of whom live on $2 a day or less, to accept aid to Europe.
“One day they will find that the Greeks retire at age 50 and go on vacation in the sun and they will have a hard time swallowing it,” he said.
Lee Howell, the chairman of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the euro zone crisis was likely to have “significant repercussions” across Asia.
BASD’s forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now faces “risks of loss” due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop "rescue plans" to protect themselves from economic upheaval and large capital leaks.
Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defence Reductions
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that impending automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, including civilian rallies.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 or more in cuts is imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in so-called sequestration would result in 23% cuts as well as the freezing of many new projects.
“Such a significant reduction, applied indiscriminately, would render most of our ships and construction projects unexecutable — you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a ship — and seriously undermine other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
“We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our readiness.”
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
“While the wartime financing of foreign contingency accounts is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in basic budgets,” Panetta said.
“Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and oversight of contracts that support the war.”
“The staff managing wages would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war vendors, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a seizure of the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.”
“We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon at the publication of Panetta’s letter.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the consequence with which we should impose ourselves."
“Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cutbacks, even as he himself has reached the Pentagon’s highest post amassing years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing tough choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a grim picture of what might happen - a military with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free brigade."
“It’s a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots.”
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don’t have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission,” Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
“It’s a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to face potential opponents.”
"De facto, it invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could “generate significant operational risks: delayed response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to waste, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship, and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Stopping the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is a key step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Spot a Lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how ubiquitous cheating and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has passed himself off as an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of those who have lived through history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been instances where teachers have given test answers to students in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie to each other three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to shout, "I got you," deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research into such projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the findings of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look you in the eye.
They do not stutter, blush, or get agitated all the time.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A skilled lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial microexpressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific findings in the vast body and still emerging knowledge about deception, and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are adept at reading others well, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more “self-centered” lies while women tell more “other-centered” lies — usually to protect someone’s feelings — than married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as an unbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called "setting the benchmark data".
This helps provide a benchmark for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, the vocal quality.
You need to know if someone is normally moving their feet all the time so as not to make unfair accusations when you see them moving their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues to verbal and non-verbal misleading behaviors.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change posture significantly or present a "post-interview" relief - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions are over.
Interviewers often falsely state that the interview is over just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Pay attention to the vocabulary of your topic.
Famous Scott Peterson drove off using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use distanced language: “I haven’t had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question altogether.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wooden tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial Pipeline Plan Will Be Misled After Threat of Late U.S. Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico — sparking anger among unions while appeasing environmentalists — the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the projected pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska's dunes, and is confident the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident it will eventually get approval for an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala Aquifer, vast underground water sources.
"It's a real path forward," Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the policy's involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do so, he would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed the plan are pushing for legislation to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department's inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family says Disco diva Patti LaBelle, launched into a rampage of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited from fear.
The “Lady Marmalade” tirade frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk to the point where she suffered “personality changes, sleep disturbances” and “increased fear of strangers,” her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk descended into the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and laid down her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said yes and I went to get her," she says.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
“She told me in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,’” says Roseanna Monk.
“I said, ‘What you say or think doesn’t interest me.’
She became angry and started using swear words - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” the child’s mother said.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who was still holding Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her entourage who dragged her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started vomiting, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a children’s cancer charity.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child.”
Climate Adversity Has Stifled the Economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled change, which generated high expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main economic indicators.
February's low temperatures, besides causing trillion-dollar losses to the agricultural sector, limited the state economy's opportunities for growth, causing overall economic activity to contract by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost affectations issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage to 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, peas and chirps.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state 18 percent, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the unemployment rate of the state during the first three quarters of the year 74 we observed an accelerated increase, because while from January to March 55 thousand 053 percent were unemployed in the second quarter, with an average rate of 4.53 percent of the active population.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who make dollars in an illicit way it is not easy for them to work to earn them, they invest them and use them in something," he says.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because when they enter they already have a lot of difficulties to find work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is worsened by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Aside from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the lag for the state is low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinoan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat for Economic Affairs, the FDI of the State reached $630,697 from January to June, representing a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the previous $5,143,312 recorded in the same period of the year.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government requested in July at the public congress the approval of a loan of 3 trillion pesos, destined for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 trillion pesos in the sector and until November no profits were observed.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employer sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our effort, it was necessary to align the effort of all and above all the good work already synchronized of this new government team, hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events like the frosts at the beginning of the year held back the state economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level e flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining the vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that we want to channel the state towards productive activities with more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we think it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we detonate the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is more inclusive, what I can say is that a lot of work has been done and the government is aware that there is still a lot to be done," he said.
Convicted of 8 kilos of marijuana
A person residing in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for possession of eight kilograms of marihuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic informed that the convicted small trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for an offence against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana intended for sale.
In accordance with AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The little trafficker was riding in a white pickup truck, in which he carried a black bag in the trunk of the vehicle and in the co-pilot’s seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items have been made available to the Second District Judge and the convict is still in the Legal Consequences Enforcement Centre for Crimes.
Debts to contributions to works
Works of a social nature contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes risk not being finished or registering serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the construction programs have so far progressed, they are in a risky situation, because the State Government has not fulfilled its obligations to offer contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end they have not given us anything, even if since July they had to give us a part of it," he said, "and we, in order not to register any delays, have started the works and we have advanced a lot, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
“We had already experienced this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid,” he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end, they haven’t given us anything.”
The Court validates the "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital ones is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television a reality.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft award, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as unconstitutional, due to the fact that the radio and television regulations are an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
In favour of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of ministers also resolved to reject the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the minister-president said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also do not consider that it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal Executive, whose constitutional mandate is the direction of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this translates into better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalization that involves a decision in the public interest that does not only have a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded in some way the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative.
We analyze the possibility of a count "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 trials.
In this sense, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize the local norms to the federal reform in electoral matters.
It will be remembered that Michoacán has not approved its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline for this electoral process to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines laid down by the Law of the State.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state representative for constitutional reforms, because he does not have the right to "sanction or challenge" them.
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to make partial and total counts of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there are no minutes of voting and counting in the record of the urn is not found in the president of the urn; or there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all the ballot boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the supposed candidate winning the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the poll is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition of the representative of the party who presented the second candidate and/or co-presented the candidates.
The total count of the ballot may also be carried out if at the end of the joint count it follows that the difference between the supposedly winning candidate and that of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party from which the candidate came out second, in which case the electoral packages that have been the subject of the partial count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the Morelia election, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the last wish of the lieutenant-colonel was that his ashes be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving tributes alongside the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest ones attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the Lieutenant Colonel arrived at the Vigil Chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes at the Saltillo Technological Institute organized by his former colleagues from the Technological Baccalaureate and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part when he was preparing for the baccalaureate.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, an affectionate brother and cared for his family very much".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they said he even had truck pain; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his parent, for this he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
The Last Goodbye
With honors we said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, tribute that had at the head the Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force's distinguished studies in both the directors and the students of the
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, alongside the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all officials of this service.
The remains of the Saltillo-born pilot Bacio Cortés arrived (incinerated) at 6:05 p.m. to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the group's esplanade, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other teachers.
Three abandoned corpses, located in Cadereyta property NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot and killed in different parts of the body and with the coup de grâce, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at the 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has beige color and coffee the portal was widely open.
Looking inside, at approximately three meters, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At a metre distance there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on their stomachs.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another place, because no sockets were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by one organized delinquency group towards the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in Cadereyta municipality and who are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in a first event on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and managed to save one who had been deprived of liberty.
They were confiscated three buildings and one cell phone; they claimed that they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel made a surveillance tour at Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
In arresting them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long gun, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the verge of economic disaster.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet on Wednesday with Italy's president to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the verge of economic disaster and put the entire eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in its majority of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former EU commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well drawn," he added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration headed by former EU commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Emphasizing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the volatility of the markets placed the yield of Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employers Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti formed.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by noting that a Monti bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti on Monday began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers’ groups and youth and women’s organizations.
He will finish his tour of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should persist until future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give it time to implement reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist that it should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convoked participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 summoned by the two countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA’s monthly standings, have an extensive record of A-class cross-selected games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have all 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain a year-round intense activity in national league and cup championships and disputes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated qualifiers of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have an international experience limited to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish national team is that of goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, head coach of Barcelona, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized last week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke forward Raúl González with 102.
Ready for the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are left-back Júnior Díaz, with 48 appearances, and scorer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not starting yet.
Spain's historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to perform in this country.
It is that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The band is in the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour and Sunday will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles group The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will perform in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve offered over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We offered two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and hopefully that set us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing there.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; this is how we learned, through the people who love surfing.
When you saw the tour, you had huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is the reason for this?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that’s why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to perform each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t performed in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and what we may have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
“First of all, I think none of us ever imagined we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for over 20 years makes it feel like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together excites us a lot.
We love each other and we love creating music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't get any better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of great groups.
We are very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we are lucky to still be friends with all of them and it is an honor for us to be part of this Seattle sound that has emerged.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that’s a lot longer than a lot of bands normally last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive, and secondly, we all care about each other.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to everyone to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t get any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity hasn’t been easy; however, thanks to your success, you’ve been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don’t spend too much time touring because it’s easy to fall into this game of the great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect the music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn’t really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and didn’t release a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important thing is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work with him.
He was an amazing human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas have to offer live and it must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
It is he who sings it and I believe he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many...
Among the first I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge up despite the fact that it is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands that I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time and, if that’s relevant now, I think it’s wonderful, because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
At first, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very obscure songs, even if they can sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there’s a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even like that we can make obscure music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he has in the pies, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from a variety of conditions, including tongue cancer for which he has been operated on four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, undoubtedly he said that the latter does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has been operated on four times of tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 pounds, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of various ministers and bosses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political themes in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the high point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that prompted the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations by its ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustache plumber moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, was designed from the beginning to take full advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile system, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," Nintendo's Spanish press secretary Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez said during the video game's presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game initially designed for this support", because hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for a fast and smooth gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the more experienced will be able to do a "second lap" in the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to cheek in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also presupposes the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that had not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo nods to saga fans and repeats the formula of success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustache plumber must travel through platforms mined with perils to free Princess Peach.
Even though I player find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had given orders for the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer to the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to judge him there.
In a press conference, Colom said his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and executive powers, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure “he had not assisted” in any judicial resolution and he had given effect to all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did presupposes an executive approach after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional instances to judge the former agent of the interval 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzlement of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor’s Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of untrained youth
The record of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
To this is added the long century of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock of an event celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping poorly trained, unemployed, with addiction problems or marginalized people.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unity of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Alongside the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor to the Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Municipal Councillor Ricard Goma attended the event.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the large hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas said Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and so is the current one, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro parties, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Balmes Street were living has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned at noon yesterday the building they were illegally occupying and where they organized micro-festivals that despaired the neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
"From that day on, there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of that of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of the mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the occupation of the building its case has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreational facility had to respond to complaints from neighbors about the noise, while, according to her, the problems were not caused by the guests of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to irritated neighbors of the area.
The head of the club explained that the trouble was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he "forgives" him the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the city, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had last week requested "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common life and civility that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were robberies as well.
In this sense, he added, "we must end impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in property."
Also yesterday, the Mossos (Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. police moved to 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the advisability of the summons beyond the controversy about the fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in numbers, with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orient itself on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for all gateways to Collserola.
A door brings back the idea of a park, without a doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of thinking about the city, is a topic of conversation for all the architects of Barcelona.
It’s almost a recurring theme that two members of this ancient caste of elected men talk about when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects from Barcelona, university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green blocks has not been completed.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "Doors of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": we should not think of them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which we must act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers that derive from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and had in the Forum area "swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
“Limiting something means already establishing the next step,” that is, its overcoming.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, of planning, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can provoke genuine disasters."
By sticking more to the question, Modol opines that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to his corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he says) that we had to create: "We, architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the bases of the competition there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-sectional competitions have been convened - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, Casino Red’s legal authority granted pardon to Monterrey’s mayor’s brother for the lawsuit initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founder of the legal power of Casino Red grants him pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale attack, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonás required him to pay an economic fee for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal case against the brother of Mayor PANiste and on 2 September he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Agent of the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 of Property Crimes, he was transferred to the Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was issued a second arrest warrant after the Public Prosecutor's Office dismissed the corruption and organized crime offences.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadereyta Penal Center allegedly for blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with one and a half million pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium-security detention center as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial locked up in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos from representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing its operation.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore, he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the public prosecutor attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who of the gambling house's associates had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to file 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is granted legal pardon and will not be able to file any claims related to the trial brought against him, nor will he be asked for compensation for damages or punishment.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours, the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Clerk of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, traveled to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally pardoned and his file would be closed.
He will also communicate to her the immediate release order that the judge has issued.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people lost his life, indicate that the helicopter crashed directly into the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, mentioned that before the take-off of the aircraft, the pilot found that the climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations made in the impact zone do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In one research it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact occurred in a structural manner.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, General Manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services assured that at the time of the impact, the Presidential Chiefs of Staff helicopter was operating at cruising speed and this happened on an ascending soft ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, the holder of the TBS, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was performed according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft advanced towards the area bordering DF and the State of Mexico, there were layers of low-height cloudiness.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew sought an area of lower height and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was neither loss of control nor alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the debris of the aircraft in a reduced zone:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The aircraft debris dispersion model makes it possible to assume that the helicopter crashed into the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion have been detected:
In the place of the accident there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the fieldwork, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above average sea level, the ground had a slope that ranged from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it possibly disarticulated along its path.
The information provides evidence that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful searching in an area wider than the encircled area around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called the protocol 'Obesity Genetics of Children and Adolescents' which will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Specialty Hospital of the 20th Century National Medical Center, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
Participants with or without rights are invited to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where evidence is provided to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 miners, the study will continue in the Unidad Sportiva Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Unidad Sportiva Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation is to know the components and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires related to diet.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family heredity history of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (the aim is to identify people associated with childhood obesity) will be applied to all participants.
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there was a 77 per cent increase in obesity among boys and 47 per cent among girls, and a dramatic increase in overweight," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American heredity, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the full evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they are overweight or obese.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and doctors provide it in writing to the parents, explaining each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - corn flour meat dough wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fat and protein and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
The UNAM asphalt would avoid blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cassis each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who has ensured that if the process of building and maintaining even the tar pavement is adequate, the cassis could be completely reduced or eliminated.
During his conference A Technological Opinion on Blackcurrant, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and therefore, the formation of blackcurrants.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the little stones that forms the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles pass through it, generating effort, it allows the forces to propagate very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, these would spread better, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, a last layer called a rolling layer is put, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip on the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the stresses, the bearing layer also requires that it be of adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be cared for.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer and it is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and consequently causes blackcurrant.
In the process of forming a blackcurrant, he says, the first one that spoils is the rolling film and only later is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrant and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrant.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and make it possible to repair cassis easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate of Valle miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives his 14th title of princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico ascended with the crown and the scepter, the department already sums 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Alvaro (1949), Alvaro Alvaro (1949), Alvaro Alvaro Alvaro (1949), Alvaro Alvaro Alvaro (1949), Alvaro Alvaro Alvaro
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Pretty Face of Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who crowned themselves Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the jury to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What was the book that marked you and why?" asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the response of the candidate from Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I believe that it is a form of culturalization, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it is a book quite profound.
Now I am reading Crime and Punishment, it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian woman, a very beautiful book called The Burning of Blood.
This answer did not please firstly because of the term "to culturalize" and secondly because it did not explain concretely how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses put forward is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota hinted that being the favorite, the cheered and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster Gastronomy Challenge, the public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on".
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two runway shows on the eve of the coronation.
Although she had seemed confident in the two parades, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for RCN’s “Como en casa” program, said the fact that Melina was nominated princess “confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the crown of queen.”
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That’s why two days before the election, international juror Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his flaws in his back and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The queen trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgical interventions that she had undergone.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect.”
For this award, which the National Beauty Competition is awarding for the first time, after the swimsuit parade came a cruel prediction that came true last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo gave to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not obtain the crown.
Thus was the work of the person from Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A typist from Cali has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a typist from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week was the turn of "availability" of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has worked for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in typing, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is, the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant of the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galton magnifying glass, ink, a collector and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a typist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar González in a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Typing is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can be crucial in resolving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, typists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identities of those captured.
When captured, many offenders present false ID cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search the database.
The researcher said that in one case of theft he had to remove a part of the wall of a house, because in that place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different robberies," he recalls.
Fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a parent may be a suspect in the crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it puts him on the crime scene.
A CTI typist explained that they extracted “fingerprints from objects with chemical or physical reagents.”
When they appear, a picker or tape is used to pick them up.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of the declinents, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without papers," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything that is touched does not necessarily become a footprint.
It can be used, however, if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
'Indignants' defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were marching in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part of the people acceded to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter Manhattan's Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were storming out of Piazza Zuccotti, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the 'outraged' to camp again in that place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the 'outraged' to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Justice Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'outraged' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, owned by the parish Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, even if Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization claims that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders traveled in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene on their behalf in front of the Police.
Meanwhile, the square Zuccotti - which is a privately owned precinct - remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters carried and distributed copies of the court order at that time and even handed it over to the officers who were monitoring the square, which caused “some small clashes,” Bray said, denouncing the fact that some officials had beaten the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing “laws issued after the beginning of the occupation or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but warned that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the early-dawn evacuation of Piazza Zuccotti, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the square because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm other people", because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
“This morning’s evacuation at dawn was disgusting and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests of American workers than it is in defending the interests of American workers,” a spokesperson for the movement said, accusing the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they did not plan to hold "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two-month protests, which began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," rescuer in "Baywatch," rabbit in "Playboy," wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" (baladine) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be appearing on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary supporting in a nursery a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth," appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special also features Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a whore during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan was reborn after the earthquake.
GDP rises 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral of early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, convalescing again after the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, Japan's worst disaster since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Government of Tokyo have estimated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have diminished.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to definitively turn the page: GDP rose by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annualized rates.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% drop in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from zero.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable rose 1%, driven by higher spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo returned to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the unrest forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed the yen’s contribution for their weak results between July and September.
While markets continue their seats in outlying EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is not lowering its guard.
“We need to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the majority of member countries had shown clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the global economy has highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
As it fell four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, dropping eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty reinstated in the parks, Greece continues to be entangled in the maze that leads to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is rather imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos yesterday pointed out that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of a hundred days established in his appointment will perhaps be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new elections in February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the civil servant disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not cast doubt on his position: "We have committed ourselves to assisting the Transitional Government, but we have committed ourselves to nothing else."
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the bodies that must unlock the $8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "an unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the necessary elements to pay the sixth tranche" of $8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second-largest donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that these types of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people who live with incomes under a dollar".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in every corner of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and original contributions during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women",
We have “achieved a lot of goals” and “we face a lot of challenges”.
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be promoted.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are emerging from the poverty line in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project yesterday brought him the qualification of "head of family" gathered in Valladolid by the "banking of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, it stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said that microcredits require "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to those "excluded to whom everyone closes the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with a spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned on the programme but prevailed in the autumn, particularly to satisfy activists who consider the government's policy too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes that Angela Merkel received at the end of their speeches and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The Chancellor's master idea - and the motion - is based on a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty allowing the European Union to strengthen its control over the fiscal policies of euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the motions adopted by the Congress, clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone is set.
Likewise, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight the weight of each country to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously amounted to strengthening the weight of Germany.
Concerned about calming the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has not sought to win her congress on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty ready to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in hollow.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud in sick leave?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family allowance fund, and give a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and welfare.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to save money in a context of rigour, but is no less announcing an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
First with a view to budgetary savings: the government is considering imposing a fourth day of shortage on private employees before taking charge of a work stoppage.
In other words, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but would yield 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: to impose on civil servants a day of deficiency not compensated in case of work stoppage (they have so far no deficiency period, compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority is also reviving the theme of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls are going to be much more important and, in addition, if you get caught, you will reimburse," Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday.
As in other cases, the advertising effects appear somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
It has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let us first turn to the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this sum, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% concerned sick leave, or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
2.5% of health care costs.
In 2010, French people experienced an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a day off from work.
Another study, this time from the Health Insurance , specifies that in 2010, 37% of the sick leave were of a duration of less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to one month, 15% of one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for health reasons or not) in France ranged between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud at sick leave accounts for very little compared to working in the dark.
As far as fraud is concerned, it is only to a small extent.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 means that the checks are systematic on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 made for short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% of cases "unfit or unjustified" out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases, on several million employees who had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little compared, for example, to that of black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to revive its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said Monday, November 14, before Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue the recovery efforts of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the head of government said, giving his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro zone "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Papadémos predicted that the country's government deficit would be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right wing rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday backed measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned his party would not commit to further austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalised, says expert committee
Canadians live in denial of death, says Royal Society of Canada report
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of a major report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "Canada's medicalization of death has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to approach the subject of death."
Medically or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, this rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, stated yesterday in a teleconference, there would be more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," Downie said.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of older people or people with disabilities are less valuable.
As for those who practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The committee also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect a denial of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts signing the report "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and is over 18 years old could ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
"In society," he says, "there are beacons and constraints."
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called a “pro-euthanasia manifesto.”
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly disputes the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, namely the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Leave Power
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday outside the premises of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, took a stand in favor of President Assad's departure.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s forces have been killed.
"If Bashar was interested in his country's interests, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Turkish mediation efforts with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had failed.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country against which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States welcomed a "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces were killed in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed "when exchanges of fire and shelling with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a news conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not bend,” he added, assuring that “the plots we have plotted against Syria will fail.”
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a “mechanism for the protection of civilians” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's repression, which he said was locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on November 2 and including the withdrawal of the armed forces from cities plagued by protest and the release of arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday said the Arab League's decision was "incorrect" while China urged Syria to implement the plan to exit the crisis, while avoiding supporting any sanctions against Damascus.

Monti demands time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
Italy's future prime minister Mario Monti has called for some time from the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting with the trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with a lot of sacrifices," Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the talks, said after meeting the president-designate.
The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a short list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are specific deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certain that the markets will be patient and will understand".
His appointment by the president had initially been hailed by the markets, but concern has taken over notably after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should form a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti pledged, once he took office, to work urgently and with the aim that Italy "become a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not meet its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, called for more stringent measures.
Italy's boss Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "because a country that does not have growth can not meet the deficit parameters".
Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place by April 2012 for 200 billion euros of government bonds.
Russian Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. nuclear risk NGO said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) draws on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to identify this researcher.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Mr Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades starting in the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and was reportedly involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then reportedly cooperated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA cites "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "has been aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a member state has informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear program of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and misdemeanors against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence declined slightly or little progress, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and offenses.
The total number of “hate crimes” increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by race differences and 20% by differences in religion, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and misdemeanors increase again,” Human Rights First said in a statement, “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a senior official at the organization.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he added, adding that this could require improved police reporting on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexuality.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter introduced Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" make it possible to follow more legibly, live the activity of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they are forwarding messages, if they are subscribing to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
Twitter's new formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT for rebroadcasting a message from someone else, <0x23>followfriday for recommending to follow another user) making the insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the Facebook and Google+ consumer networks.
On the network, users were suddenly debating sliced "tweets" about the value of this innovation.
“It’s useless, intrusive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” writes <0x40>jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed,” <0x40>dannykronstrom wrote.
Austrian
The introduction of a “golden rule” in the Constitution
Austria's ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democrat grand coalition government decided on Tuesday to include a budget "golden rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
The decision was announced by Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann at the end of a Council of Ministers, while Austria’s public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by a single notch, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest each year," said Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian Democratic foreign minister.
Austria responds to a request from the eurozone summit in Brussels on 26 October: the heads of state and government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The arrangement adopted by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", with Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease each year by 0.75% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal state will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Yen Fort
Noda threatens further intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historic levels that prompted Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record of strength against the greenback since 1945.
But the yen has steadily risen since then, boosted by purchases from investors who see it as a “refuge value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and Europe’s debt crisis.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen mark, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in Japanese currency is damaging the archipelago's exports as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign revenues from Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern Tohoku region, Noda said, fearing that the rising yen could kill the fragile recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy returned to growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households plunged by the disaster.
But the prime minister said the yen’s high price did not reflect “Japan’s economic fundamentals.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy board on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “the appropriate measures”, suggesting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5 trillion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion), increasing to 55 trillion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts it devotes to purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
Rates are rising, stock markets are slumping
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in weaker countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the eurozone, the European stock exchanges sink a little more into negative territory on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt sold 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With new strains on borrowing yields of eurozone states struggling, stock markets around the world continue to return some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are just too aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, suffering in turn from renewed fears by market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the eurozone penalizes the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At around 10am, the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it backed down after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, met in congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing for the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with suffocation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain finds itself in the spotlight of the markets, as parliamentary elections are held Sunday in the country.
The rate spread between Germany and Spain’s 10-year bonds has reached a new all-time high.
Awaiting the growth figures of the euro area
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
INSEE, however, revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a 0.1% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it is truly the fourth that most worries economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., as the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy for an election to be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the place that nuclear power plays in them.
The debate will be fruitful only if it explores the full economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world’s population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity permanently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, a topic disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case of Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor of Switzerland, which just intends to build only last generation power plants.
Conversely, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their plans with determination.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to its park by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will translate into an increase in the price of electricity, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, especially from Russia, a jump in CO2 emissions driven by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
Within a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
European champion of wind energy, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas because of the intermittent wind; under which, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would lead to a sharp increase in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show any opposition in principle to this energy, the polls show.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it brings a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them highly creative of non-relocatable jobs.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear power, it would be to sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing as a pity the 6 billion euros of annual French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years when the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of miraculous electricity production, nor is there any diabolical one.
Areva's development of low-CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a safety authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing plants as well as the Flamanville construction site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has had three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults provoked the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
The result of this approach and cooperation between safety authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it able to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF, leaving them with the clear path to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate a debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming in passing that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the left and the right on this issue.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right.
On both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be bestowed on immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to trivialities, stating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may pay off electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent book synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among immigrant countries that wage earners on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth.
Restraining immigration anemia growth and damaging employment.
The fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are likely to take the place of national workers, especially low-skilled workers, exerting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, with most of them working in sectors where there is a shortage of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the job offer.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will struggle to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on nationals' wages and employment.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows leads to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real wages over the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to public budgets on average over his or her entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to go and look for the missing growth points "with teeth".
The teeth in question, which were used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, European democracy remains to be thought of
Democracy is a precious commodity; it is also a fragile commodity.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be enough for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
We know from Napoleon the Little that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also and first of all a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have had in this respect a double revealing value: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought of in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic combat have now shifted, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to necessity and in dispersed order.
A blank-seed to the absolute European monarch or a leap to join in the void of nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cutters, but a common, full-fledged, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - we can no longer know where to stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is bending to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
Together, Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will entail decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now demanding a European economic government.
Let's go.
But thinking about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
"Non-contact" smart cards are becoming more common
The global smart card trade fair opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 should end with an increase of 11% in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card ...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most popular segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or pay for your purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for nearly 10% of the overall smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Long behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been deployed.
But large surfaces put double bites.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To move to the next level, banks now need to equip their customers.
“Two major French institutions have committed to systematically distributing contactless-equipped bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Visa Europe France’s managing director.
Banks are testing mobile payment
But this is only the first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required for transactions.
"They're late."
“But they should finally have a real boom next year.”
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide,” said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Societe Generale, too, said yesterday that it was preparing to put on the market an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's deputy foreign minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
“The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation,” he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day along with several of their abductors during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the calls pointed to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for years that the sect has external financial and intellectual support and is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these “supports” had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its modus operandi, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and similar to those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore lobbied Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminates of little interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for Sharia law while its activists engage in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars and administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, nuanceless.
The army invades the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on the sect will radicalize and leave its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and another in Abuja.
In June, it was in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the security headquarters of the police during a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local UN headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia via Nigeria now worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invaded Mali and Niger, while al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat at the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all the information".
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival simplicity and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the thunderous statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsupported - fuse.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the nomination of the "Great Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and to question them "for manipulation of their currency", a theme bearer in an America exasperated by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if it means a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly choked on an attitude that “flats” emotions.
He called for a robust but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the image of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I’m elected, I’ll stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they’ll have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-placed candidate, is embarrassingly ignorant of the cases.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop a nuclear capability” – seemingly ignorant of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who backs Israel and wants strikes against Iran, said he was ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his anti-terrorism wine.
They rightly insist on the failure of its na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on its misrepresentations in Libya, thus sticking a label of weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The public considers Obama’s national security record, which eliminated bin Laden, rather positive.
Since Iraq, it is wary of military interventions that lead to stalemate.
And by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
Nord Stream, Russia’s new gas gateway to Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly to Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated on Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe via a first 1,224 km tube linking the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is due to be completed by the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And there is already talk of the possibility of building a third one on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction site feels like victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is becoming more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland, in 1939.
That is to say if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in making its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, heavily gas-consuming Western countries whose deposits are declining.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us in an organic way," Fillon confirmed in inaugurating the pipeline, demonstrating how big gas contracts are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by the Gazprom leaders, present in number in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-clad steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the Second World War.
“A hundred had to be abducted or destroyed, as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply the measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, that nothing interrupts over its entire length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders gave up on it when the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state company permanently set up off their coasts.
“In case of damage, we stop the gas passing in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who planned the welds to see a leak every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline is monitored by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the pipeline.
In the shape of a cigar, it is introduced into the tube, one meter wide in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, he delivers precise information on the possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to run for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 bars at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies created a joint venture, Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty renewable years, the entire capacity of gas transport.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” said Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was 30% by the shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to pay their costs, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that arrives, before it is transferred to German gas pipelines.
Since Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give back the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
Yet, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design notebook but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought an old and forgotten object to life, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand’s head at Modo Modo.
The success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces sold.
We are far from the confidential production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robotic portrait of the buyer, because the notebook appeals to businessmen, students and professionals alike.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its inception, now has almost 100 employees and since 2008 has two offices; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city center and has been able to impose her identity.
"We followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover for the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a whole range of supports.
A success that made envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Employment Week for the Disabled begins today.
Despite a proactive public policy implemented in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Discouraging?
"No," says Eric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
" The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher."
"However, there is still a great deal to be done."
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before accessing employment.
They are quite old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for disabled people, compared to 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that complicate the return to employment, and that "constitute the node of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That is the objective brakes.
There remains the unsaid, the mentalities that are evolving, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers interviewed have "a low level of knowledge of the disability", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectually disabled".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the 6% employment target for disabled workers, set out in a law of 1987.
The last known figures, which date back to 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, general manager of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxed" institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, increasing from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before facing the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly game provides them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the platform of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after his striker's mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
“I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian.
"I want to move forward," said the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances in club and in selection, "it is a whole, he justified himself."
"In Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
“I have to take my marks.”
Defeated against Romania on Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Not to mention the notion of “pleasure.”
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supportive,” he says.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
Especially since in front, "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We crossed paths just now."
"Being able to play against them is just happiness!"
With good humour, Leekens, for his part, evoked "pride".
"Proud" to play "a gala game".
"Proud" also to note - as a "neighbor" - that France has "returned to a very high level team" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a thunderous job," he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be well seen sharing the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting bigger,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll see that in the next few games." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento begins with a lot of optimism his return barrage against Bosnia (20.00 pm), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the end of the day, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, Selecçao, which he has been at the helm since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to unravel.
In view of the first leg (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but they were unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved them.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score a goal on the outside."
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as hot, even if the party is obviously "very tight", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are quite convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012", said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The draw reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score a goal on the outside," Bento said.
“We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put as much pressure on the Bosnians as possible so as not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, as long as you're realistic this time.
