Populist right triumph in Austria, together make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, a significant weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
The Austrian People’s Party (OVP) has suffered heavy and special losses, where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still has ended the OVP losing 25.6 percent, nearly nine percent of the vote.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war era and especially for the people who called these early elections.
Still in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Even in the first reactions to the results, speculation was heard about the resignation of the party president and, until today, vice-chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be reached as early as Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would evidently facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the grand coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same would be repeated in 1999 when the popular party negotiated with the populists (then the European Union came into being a unity, but in 2005 the B government split).
For this evolution Haider clearly bets who has already announced that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and is therefore not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool
Failure to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York, after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this is not resolved then yes, then this cooling would certainly be achieved," he said after the meeting, which was organised on a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters the executive can hardly get involved.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was exempted from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“Your problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest authorities.
He can then request the exoneration of the case and await the release of the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague spoke in the same terms during the meeting.
"It advises appealing to the High Court and then a pardon would be possible," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convict "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already obtained by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize it too," Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, before her colleague she insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister evaded the answer to the question of whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
“I’ve received a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech arbitrates a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, depicting Australia surrounded by the sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small spot lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and the seabed around it.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its boss, director of the Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this talent and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed hides until today a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms until today that themselves carry the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the land
The coastal countries have today begun to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the so-called Continental Rim which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the Continental Rim.
"Continental edge simply means the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the continent underwater.
It reaches the limit of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is, pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continental border, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of preparation of works.
“One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist help commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward,” adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a worldwide impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominance.
However, New Zealand also got it – the seafloor area awarded to it by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in pain for their study.
The profit that will be derived from the use of the seabed will, as promised, be invaluable.
Other states are also slowly submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the Continental Rim ends, begins the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty as a "common heritage of humanity".
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
“The seabed, however, is not a gold mine,” says Director Mikulka, adding “that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.”
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is divided with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
“An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in deposits of polymetallic concretion containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” added Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages, the German special forces command was at the scene.
To resolve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue action.
Therefore at the place of release were specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation also experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokespersons reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany's help to use it as a support on the spot.
"Fortunately, that time did not come," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On 19 September, in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian woman as well as her 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt the hostages were deported back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the safe and sound people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the tutelage of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return in Airbus from Germany's air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives does not approve the bailout package
The first chamber of the United States Congress let fail with scarce a large $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell sharply.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s plan to save financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties failed to reach a majority for the program with which disorder in financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action the desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked lawmakers to cast a vote, although the plan was not as popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn’t happened at all yet,” he said.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investor concerns that the state bailout might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts expect other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To allow the program to enter into force it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened conjuncture the desire to travel of the Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the market research institute GfK, reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, reported the DVR.
The basis of the results are GfK figures that are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are the travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar especially travel to the United States are in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
Germans’ preferred destinations are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and power prices are rising, in this case travel expenses are "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so that the sales volume compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, compared to last year, fell.
It's my first Oktoberfest.
Party hits under the open sky in the endless spa, beer in one-liter jugs and famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on TV and wears a custom-made traditional Bavarian costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: we are barely in tent, the photographers already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it is very flattering especially because I am first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being with a traditional Bavarian costume until this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for so much.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian suits or leather pants; none seem to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in the chocolate.
A Munich woman draws my attention to my apron that I wore in the wrong way: "the left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is widow."
Oh God, now I'm strapped from behind to the left.
“Okay,” he says laughing.
The others don't care much about the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it says "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their knotted ass.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, he is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
He looks like "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after he has put a glass of a liter of beer next to him that he has just drunk.
He put it right next to the fire pit, most think that's a garbage can.
Then Bob is one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume as much alcohol.
At about eight o’clock at night sanitary groups run around the party venue and have to worry about poor drunks.
Sanitary wards appear every time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered walkways from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They arrive sober, they return drunk.
You can't see who's suffering from the alcohol levels and is on the floor.
“They’re the ones who ‘can’t do it anymore,’ I was answered by a sanitary man answering my question and disappeared in a riot.
Accident Victim Identified by Police
A 63-year-old pedestrian has been identified who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers nestled in the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inland from Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set at the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, all resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a bit decadent.
But once the vaulted box office is over, there’s no doubt what the company’s greatness was that this was the westernmost door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Their railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under
British rule and when the forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then the station has been decaying and has remained on the sidelines of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new collaboration policy.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I climbed into a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shakes, which produced the cadences of the old world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has aroused some suspicion in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "power pastries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Costume, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The objective of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the East and the West at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point," I asked, "could Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replies, "does not want to face that choice."
He then underlines a point that almost everyone I have spoken to up to that point had recited to me almost from memory: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically assemble those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again to the station of Hydarpasha, after a second night without sleep, my thoughts turn to the two German lords, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had assisted in the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, in large part, would now be in the hands of Turkey?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt in which continent this fascinating country must claim.
Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its ending in 1979, several of us were finishing 20 - let's just refuse to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form-changing being) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, whether unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
You just have to sing!”
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxable, nor too flourishing.
Whatever the musical setting, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve reviewed over 100 of his shows and I can honestly say that I’ve never, by any one, been disappointed – otherwise I’ve often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply “sold one or two very well-known warhorses around the world.”
We're gonna miss it a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25) you state that "in 1946 he resumed his studies of economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's, a master's and a doctoral degree."
This is learned in a Woodruff author's note on Beyond Nab End, but it's not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a hoplon-norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second round for Honda's bestseller
In November Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz.
If its predecessor already had ample habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
Added to this are refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and allow you to save more fuel.
Evolution in the face of revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model we must comment that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, where the Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Precisely in Japan, about one million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz will allow to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese company marketed a total of 83,000 units of the Jazz, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a growth of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of the Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the heads of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of the Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to mitigate to a large extent the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2% by 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters in length - which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be shared between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented in partnership in the month of January in Valencia.
Regarding the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its dimensions.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase up to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - is up to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measurements are from the version with the 1.4 engine, since the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will have two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre mechanic achieves a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 laps.
This thruster - which previously reached 78 horsepower - has an expense of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With respect to the previous thruster, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horsepower, now it has 100.
This 100-horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that prevents collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of the bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important is the bee’s compound eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly uninterruptedly within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately results in collision prevention.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right angle or greater to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect up or down, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allow it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can operate continuously with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, not even megas.”
This is the first step in developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in series cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the way.
Trembling Before Mortgage
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of fluid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created a fun and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the "Hotel of bad credits"... or trouble.
The tedious aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two and even three times if it is time to ask for a credit.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful information, but little detailed.
It’s more a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because to buy a better house we don't even talk...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its listing.
A week after uncovering a provisional settlement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley’s common shares at the unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a return of 10% and a conversion price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on a price per unit of measurement of $29, or 28% above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley shares were down 6.79% at $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s chief executive officer.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he does pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Their alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to behave much more cautiously than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for almost $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” explained Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG in Tokyo, “we thought that the participation would have been composed only of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and hedge ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert within one year half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, or at $47 or so, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital contributed by MUFG will allow it to take investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined, however, to clarify the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to show a Tier One solvency ratio of close to 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had eased his balance sheet a lot since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been exhausting for the group, which has seen its stock price drop by half as the cost of security against a risk of defaults on its debt took off.
This cost fell last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, he is the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to the official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory to the "yes", estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The " Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly " , he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who lead the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, to be held in full calm, according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, referred to a 444-point text consolidating the " new socialism " advocated by the President.
The draft Constitution implied an increase in the State ' s power over the economy, reserving for it the " development planning " of a country that lived essentially on the extraction of oil by foreign companies and on foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants enhanced powers to the head of state, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also strengthens the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally foresees the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 abductees have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after they were released Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good on arrival at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft at the Al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages were taken by 35 unknown abductors while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since gone from one to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the safari organization.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces members, carried aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said the official, who remained anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men in the secret services, in the special forces," he said.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
Earlier, the Sudanese army said it had intercepted an all-terrain vehicle during a patrol in which the kidnappers were on board, killing six of them, including the Chadian chief, and detaining two.
It also claimed that they were related to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes the headlines and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better this way.
But a part of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve to death?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don’t we have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore only the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and all of this in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with little money piles of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
It is these who are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and desperation when promoters and officials throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands states - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization to the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis which is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at the highest level with the President of the European Central Bank and the head of economic competition of the European Commission.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer from the Eurozone crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves more than a year ago, therefore the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a certain sense can be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken early on Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the property owned by the Bank in their area.
The Bank is sure to sell a portion of its business, including most of the activities – mainly insurance – purchased last year from Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis shares began a sharp decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already important signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, this bank is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company’s shares fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Looking at current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management blamed the sharp fall in Fortis shares on the insecurities of the US market in relation to the approval of the US $700 billion package plan.
On Monday, stocks showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new managing director.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has made a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors had nothing to worry about, they would not lose their money.
Among the Bank’s clients so far there has been no panic, they did not invade the bank offices to withdraw their money.
The Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the U.S., life and health insurance companies when viewing drug purchase data, often deny signing an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which to the use of the data of the recipes in all cases joins the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because otherwise, "we entrust the chicken coop to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the program tracking prescriptions.
Insurance companies make the insurance price and the amount of compensation dependent on the client’s health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply don’t make the contract.
Before they sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him already knowing the result of the control.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: with the customer identification number easily gets from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the diseases and health status of the customer.
For example, if you consistently take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a number of risk, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has hardly anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some drugs are multipurpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk-increasing factor for insurance companies while the former do not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, request the patient's approval.
Authorities are already forcing them to do so, though they have not been fined for negligence so far.
Some companies recently also compile the results of laboratory tests and by linking them with drug consumption data get more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is becoming more and more difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
The bill that gives the right to the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: hence he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the individual for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, in spite of everything, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
Global menu of Marseille
EU doubles trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocally trading partners, this topic in addition to the other mostly global issues dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, focusing mainly on cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs but member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been dealt with at the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU President-in-Office, José Manuel Barroso, Commission President, and Javier Solana, India’s top foreign policy representative, welcomed Manmohan Singh, India’s prime minister, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase their trade to more than one hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
They have thus legally harmonized the 26 existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi ranks only ninth among the EU’s trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of the latter - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also pressed, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate agenda, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20%.
India also agrees with this, just as next year’s climate conference should reach a global agreement and cut through 2050 by fifty percent the production of greenhouse gases.
They also wished to hamper the rise in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the deal would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.

It will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of goods and cultural activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government in the ceremony of inauguration of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
A meeting with the print will follow in Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors progressively decreases over the total Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane found missing a year ago
The wreckage of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris has been found on an altiplano at 3,000 meters above sea level, in the area of the Mammoth Lakes Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Wood County Commissioner John Anderson has dispelled the doubts that remained: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have the confirmation that it is proper to what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said in a press conference.
No human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire was presumed dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (NTSB) has announced that a few hours after the sighting of the wreckage, a squadron of researchers has been sent to identify the aircraft: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two Fossett-named documents, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, by the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the world tour in a hot air balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the round of the world by plane and without stops.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don’t expect
An off-scheme SUV with an original and well-established design with defined lines and definite angles.
It is this, in summary, Glk the last born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
The communication that will accompany the launch of the Glk SUV, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th, will be unexpected and unconventional.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the central street of the Milanese shopping, avenue Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the Avenida Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Successively, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Can this formula capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, there is a ban on access to sports events.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, has never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival’s fans either.
The extraction of the group is right-wing.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) of the Campaign and Apulia.
They have three-colored flags where the militants’ hometown appears: Saturday night they have been pulled out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of real Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with names, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among what they had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (ban on sports events) at the time, none that had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of delinquency in stadiums, have been refused the ticket and also the trip.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents attending not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't set foot in a stadium.
Fortunately!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others will be added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way," they said from the Ministry of the Interior.
That’s why, “eyes wide open” especially in view of Wednesday’s National League match in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia holders.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also count on a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is, the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"Duce-Duce choirs and raised arm during Mameli hymn? In Bulgaria it is not a crime ..."
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, since a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the place that was before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste’s head of public safety where there is a core of holders of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duce but, yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fanatics that has been shameful.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds the Observatory’s No. 1, “the crimes are attributed to the countries in which the fact occurs.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s hymn: those too are not a crime, but if they allow, they are also not of education.”
