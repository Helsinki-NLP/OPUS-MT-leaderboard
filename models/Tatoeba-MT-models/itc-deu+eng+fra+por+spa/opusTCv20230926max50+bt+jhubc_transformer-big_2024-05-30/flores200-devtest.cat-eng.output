USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee’s charter and recognizes the Olympic family’s absolute need to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the U.S. Olympic Committee’s statement that the interest of athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served, with significant advances within the organization, rather than removing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could clarify as an abuse, of the proportion so courageously described by Larry Nassar’s survivors, could have gone unnoticed for so long, and adopts the necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC have the same goal: to make gymnastics, and other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowered environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but offers details that fossils normally cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that the feather of this animal was brownish on top with a light colored background or carotenoid.
The findings also provide insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed cannon, called a spine, but do have other characteristics of bearded and barbed feathers, the researchers deduce that the spine was probably a more recent evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used to fly but to regulate temperature or to display themselves. Researchers have suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample presents the plumage of an adult and not a chick.
The researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult plumage, not plumage.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.

They have discovered that the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system has been seen to depend on their brightness, their rotation and nothing more.
Luminosity and rotation are both used to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be with respect to magnetic inversions.

The work has been mostly theoretical, but the program has been written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the earth, which causes the tides, the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.

Infrared images show variations in day and night temperatures that show that they are probably caves.
They are colder than the surface surrounding them during the day, and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but is consistent with the hypothesis that they are deep holes in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a not-so-technological experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper with the candidate they have chosen.
After those responsible verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
The French electoral law strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes other than those of duly counted and authorized voters are added.
Candidates can send representatives to testify to each part of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers count votes under strong supervision, following specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have recovered her mobile phone and her computer."
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was relocated to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Sheriff's Court of Scotland charged with the murder of her son.
He is in custody pending prosecution and trial, but any visual testimony could be rejected because his image has been published everywhere.
This is a common practice anywhere else in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “journalists seem to be walking down a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of the suspects.”
The Crown’s office, which is in charge of the indictments, has told reporters that it will not make further statements, at least until the verdict.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to establish according to the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Among the other issues dealt with, it is reported, is the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the PA only agrees to accept it for five years.
Hunters in the supplementary pest control pilot test were to be closely monitored by forest rangers, as the pilot test was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
In an association of NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooters Association (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Hunting Association program of the Sports Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Acting Director of the Conservation and Heritage Park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received adequate safety training.
Yesterday Martelly took the oath of office to a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council, as part of a package of measures aimed at advancing the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of elections, some of them scheduled for 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunction and overheating of iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing less than four burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
In response, the ministry called Apple’s postponement of the report “unfortunate slander.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office said no damage has been reported to the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there had been no tsunami signals.
A former Philippine policeman has held tourists from Hong Kong hostage for kidnapping his bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages have recently been released, including children and the elderly, as well as Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an older lady, who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth during his spare time.
Their research showed that if a hormone was administered, the fetal lung maturation of the baby would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Companion fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Pretty unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as freaky as I...may be even more...I love her and will find her at the altar...hope she finds herself in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people questioned before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of respondents want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner was to swim in the 100 and 200 m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been questioned due to his complaints.
He has not been able to take the necessary medications to withstand his pains because they are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number discovered as of January 25.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water sent to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his government earlier this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors of "political chatter and bullshit."
He is expected to run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology unlike older ground-based radar technology for traffic controllers to locate pilots much more accurately and send them more accurate information.
There is no provision for reinforcement of transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley; there are no car parks or connecting car parks on the street either.
The concern of a lack of transport has led to the possibility that the game should be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian islands of the Galapagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that much more time was needed for this process, due to the crossing between a Darwinian pineapple, Geospiza forte (endemic), and a Galapagos pineapple, concopic.
Gold can be worked in all kinds of ways. It can be molded into the smallest figures.
It can be inserted into thin threads, which can be twisted. It can be struck or flattened into sheets.
It can be made very fine and stacked on other metals. It can be made so fine that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images from books called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a substance. You can make an indicator using cabbage juice.
Lombard cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H of pH) in the substance analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (as long as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with clean damp hands, make a ball of it.
The moisture in the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected by a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathrooms where men and women met in joint company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and our sight.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet tall to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most outstanding thing the wheel has done for us has been to make transportation much faster and easier.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are more medium-sized cats eating medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat small prey that are far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called flocks.
The herds are made up of one to three adult males related together with up to thirty females and puppies.
Females are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion flocks behave to a large extent as doves or wolf flocks, which are animals with behavior surprisingly similar to that of lions (although not to that of other large cats) and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump long distances and push with 5 times the force of a forcible human.
The tiger is of the same group (genus panther) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full roar of the lion, but rather like a phrase called words of anger.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than he.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals that are eaten (taken) with smell, summing up the traces they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. The ocelots hunt their prey camouflaged with the environment and then flee over their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main and original group (e.g., crossing a mountain range or river, or migrating to a new island and unable to go back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they continue to need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe and take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, we exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our houses with plants and make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat are plants. Without plants, most animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of his time, which is why he was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than seventy sharpened teeth like knives, accompanied by an additional play in the sky of his mouth, so there was no escape from anything that stood in his way.
We don’t know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, long fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could rival him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a few rare or unusual products at their banquets; such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and rodents called lions.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate seated in a chair, rich men liked to participate in banquets where they dined together while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that have arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built to each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to cover the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary that only priests could access.
Special tower pyramids, called ziggurats, were sometimes built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not as important.
Most of the Jewish family life was spent in the open air.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open counters looking down the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland because of an assassination and, traveling westward, discovered Greenland and gave it the name.
However, despite their discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at that time.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that behind the Declaration of Independence a treasure map has been written.
Now, that's not true. Although there's something written behind the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written behind the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, downwards.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its creation the long parchment (measuring 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up to store it.
Thus, it appears that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the "de Vichy" France. These were Frenchmen who had signed peace with the Germans in 1940 and who collaborated with the invaders instead of confronting-'shi.
The Allies invaded southern France on 15 August 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the French Free Forces had liberated southern France and advanced towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by an important group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this also somehow defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states preceded the nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural footprint and an equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without obvious historical traces and are not recognized as civilizations themselves.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, with Congress being their only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and as there was no national executive or judicial branch, it fell to the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its acts.
Nor did he have the authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous approval of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often abstained.
The Italian national football team, with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The best-known sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motoring.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, we often call it, in geographical terms, an "archipelago".
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors of passage coined for the island the name Formosa Island, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, where it began the transformation of indigenous grain production practices and resorted to Chinese workers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Window.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common frame format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size at the close of the analogue film era.
It still occurs today, but even more importantly: its aspect ratio has been inherited in the sensor formats of digital imaging cameras.
The 35 mm format creates, in fact, a bit of confusion, with 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are the same or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple rule that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period, European history called into question the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist precisely for this reason.
The main authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder if this dogma was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies to military and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire segments of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
Because there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
Having seen the horrors and atrocities of the war during World War I, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents on his name, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss at the last job he had) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different historical epochs: each stage of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
Also between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The best known of these periods was the time of the Three Kingdoms which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods fierce wars took place between many of the nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit in the highest seat in the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Equally after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all men who requested it, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve it.
This also applies to the military, because instead of basing the ranks of the army in classes, from that time they were based on relevance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working class of other countries to begin their revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that would be known as "Hira" on the Mount of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a very clear picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the top of 1 of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, and even knowing its existence, it is not easy to find. Isolation is absolute once you get inside the cave.
Nothing can be seen except a serene and beautiful sky above the head, and the abundant mountains that surround it. There is very little of this world that can be seen or felt from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Egyptian Valley of Death contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Kheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and minor temples were erected in honor of the wives and members of the Pharaoh's family.
The "arc up" signal resembles the letter V (lower vein) and the "arc down" signal looks like a staple or square without the lower side.
When it appears upwards it means that you have to start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and when it is downwards it means that you have to start at the heel (which is where the hand holds the bow) and stretch the bow downwards.
Rubbing the strings from right to left generates a softer sound, while doing so the other way around produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Take the liberty of writing down your own directions, but keep in mind that bow marks are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, her two young sons (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged four) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a multitude of women traders to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to bring the carriage windows fully open.
At one point, a member of the mob showed the head of a murdered royal guard at Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime, in order to cover much of the expenses and interest of the bonds floated on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the large profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic profits of U.S. imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that promoted the creation of the order.
The epoch in which the events took place is popularly known as the Full Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1,000–1300 AD).
The Full Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological impetus or technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is guided by an occult logic that is associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new medical assistance techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had an important component of cultural determinism, drawn by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography appeared that were better than laws imposed arbitrarily, since they were in harmony with the place and with society.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders had returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices that had more value than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital went from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached maximum popularity in the period between the tenth and eleventh centuries, and in the fourteenth century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, and due to the slowness of the communication channels, the styles could reach the west with 25 to 30 years of delay.
towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time is that, as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to button clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is that which is carried out to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses natively stored seeds from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel abandoned by society’s standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as different may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture are often distinguished from those of other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashions, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults as they grew up, due to negligence, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical deficiency by the parents.
Wild children may have suffered child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are believed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
The wild child, when raised only by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (always within physical limits) almost identical to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffold goes one step further.
Frame theory is not a method of learning, but an aid that provides support to individuals undergoing a new training experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or starting a project.
The scaffolding can be virtual or real: in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the small assistant clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized into the software and are designed to question, show, and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to get away with on their own.
Children are given in foster care for different reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, through extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not fed, loved and educated, but there are those who do.
We believe that the foster care system is a form of safety for these children.
Our host system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
It is assumed that the host confers all the needs that were not covered in the house from which they were originally taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated public reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it can be detected if a person lies by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that these abilities of interpreting human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of variation heritage that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine the variation back and forth between the two genetic heritages in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet their amino acid needs with available plant resources.
In addition, failure to achieve it has serious consequences: decay of growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain would have been the proteins provided by the leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, they are difficult for primates like us humans to digest.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide a large amount of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
However, we shouldn’t be surprised that our ancestors solved their “protein problem” just as chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of waking up during the normal period of sleep and falling back asleep after a while (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do using a low-noise alarm clock that makes you aware but does not wake you up completely.
If you are one of those who restarts the clock while you sleep, try putting it on the other end of the room, so that you have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, so one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is correlatively opposite to the amount of tension in one’s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Each person has the potential to find peace and full satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were spread along the path of love of the Mahayana and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga the kundalini energy (enlightened energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakres are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which facilitated the collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came the collision of systems, processes and cultures, and both countries were enmity.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted the next forty years and was fought in earnest, with delegated armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939 Polish defences had already been penetrated and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having invaded eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the other Soviet-Polish bilateral or multilateral non-aggression pact.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy’s ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most relevant recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Contemporaneously, the German navy, using mostly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to conquer Britain, just as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountain range in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to easily dispose of milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats used to be kept in herds that grazed on hills or other grazing areas, often guarded by shepherds who used to be children or teenagers. These methods of grazing are still used today.
The wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they tied the wagons with horses to achieve higher speeds and tied larger loads in the most difficult parts.
The crossings were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was soon seen that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron deck on top.
This became a common practice, but iron wore out more the wooden wheels of the wagons.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking, humans began to walk on their right two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "right man").
His ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal specializations have been found in austrolipitec fossils 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelantrops may have walked on 2 legs stretching 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to partly reduce the suffering that might exist in the future.
This works only as symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we do not want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that the problems have grown due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson to John Dunlap's printing press located a few blocks away.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, which today are known as "Dunlap flyers".
The first public reading of the document was held by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 leaflets of Dunlap that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original manuscript copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists nowadays believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and that it is alive. We call them birds.
Many people don’t see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many features of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaur would.
Virtually every computer we use today relies on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, depending on the computer slang.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting are fairly general, so an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic domestic chemicals.
Look for instructions on specific first aid for the specific poison on the label.
The term insect is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient kinship with bugs, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Both the redudds and the bed bugs are nestlings, adapted to be seen in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, formed by the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has concluded that women are twice as likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
At an adoption, the parents of birth end their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits and ecosystem information study.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive out of the small rural villages to their workplace and pass along to others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic vehicle everyone, somehow, is connected with, and supports, a private car-based transportation system.
Science shows today that this huge coal economy has unraveled one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of man over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries you will rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate this kind of complaints, why do they fail every day? Is it that transport engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that are established between them.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because you can’t predict the driver’s behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, conductors tend to behave within a considerably constant range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have considerable constancy and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them to flee from enemies more easily and find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend their wings around their body.
This provides them with a variety of tiny places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the spies and the ephemeral ones.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
There were people who thought that what he said was true, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved towards the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because we don't feel like the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
20 percent of the water flowing from the planet’s rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people living in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since ancient times, as they can all be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
It looked more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although in addition, according to his theory, they changed to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys may also have small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The whole universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of atoms would fit within the endpoint of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend of many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and uses.
Nowadays we write messages on computer screens, without ever needing a sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new emerges.
The fission pump works on the principle that it takes energy to join a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Separating the core again releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break with a small or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called bark.
The crust measures 70 km in thickness in the nearest part and 100 km in the farthest part.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
There may be more lunar seas on the visible face because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to come out to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people like or are interested in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors can appear as administrators begin to lead their previous colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain as "another boy" (or girl).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary actions, conducting assessments, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable for their actions.
In the opposite case, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he has to change everything that the team has been doing and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in scuffles between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual computers are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional computers, but with some small differences.
Members of a virtual group usually function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than the members of conventional teams, since their teams may meet according to different time zones that the local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is addressed. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One of the objectives for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, the joint work of an organization to overcome adversity can lead to an innovative process to respond to the need of the customer.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. Therefore, it narrows the research area and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of damage, trauma, injuries and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate never-before-seen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions as well as recognition of writing, voice and face.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been built into various domestic computer applications and video games.
Thematic outings are an important part of any class. Very often, a teacher would love to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or gaze at the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the site is updated, but older versions are kept online as a book of memories.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although students usually start their blogging experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the existence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogs "force students to be smarter with the world around them". The need to nurture audience interest inspires students to be clever and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students be more analytical and critical; they can define their postures in the context of which others write and also highlight their own perspectives on specific topics by actively responding to internet materials (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
To the south are the Niagara Falls and the north is home to the unspoilt natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
It is all these elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out in the eyes of outsiders as the Canadian city par excellence.
The population of the large expanses of the north is rather scarce, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
To make a population comparison that is usually surprising: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by far, and a continent in itself as far as wildlife is concerned.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it undertook a great path in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route in India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable for any female traveler to say that she is married, regardless of her true marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (one that does not seem very expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can provoke what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be persecuted, taken by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and don’t be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, that’s not good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazonian fishermen in the 10th century CE, and Phoenicians, Romans and Benimerines used it as a strategic port, which bore the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name Daru l-Badya, the name of Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the surroundings of the ancient Medina we can easily find places to sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, pottery, leather objects, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it is all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, towards the eastern end, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially downtown.
While Goma is considerably safe, it would be advisable to investigate before making any visit outside this city to assess the state of the fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most economical mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use the wedding-wedding (moped taxis) to move around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" has ended up being used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites that are endangered, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' special program "Wonders of the African World" for PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab than African air.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each assisting diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entry fee must be paid.
It can also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a selection of South African parks or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
The set of buildings that make up the urban silhouette of Hong Kong has been linked to a bright bar graph that becomes evident with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head across the Kowloon Waterfront.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely populated in sea-gained land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers occupied, therefore, it is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps but include some of the last remaining stops in the mighty jungles that had once covered the gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered with water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that in the area there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 axes.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is an entangled bridge. It extends along the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical open space under the bridge is 15 meters. Although construction was completed in August 2011, it was not possible to transit it until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully functional in September 2017, when Brazil’s customs are expected to be ready.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indies", was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important annual tournament of this sport takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Here you can also see smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), with an established value equivalent to one British Pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands and within Stanley credit cards and U.S. dollars are also accepted.
Peripheral islands will probably not accept credit cards, although they may accept British and American currency; check with owners in advance to determine which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so you have to leave.
As Montevideo is located in southern Ecuador, it is summer there when in the northern hemisphere it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely reach levels below zero, but wind and humidity combine to make the feeling colder than what the thermometer signals.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is more or less unchanged throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wildlife and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bones and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from the rest of the wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, bison, wapitis, ants, bones and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not having left a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bones and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking odorous foods and keep the camping site clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous insubordination in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to abandon it.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruise ship, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are plentiful, as Auckland is straddled by two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (North Harbour District) face the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are in Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes full family beaches with a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The best-known local beer is the "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be drunk, but wines from New Zealand and Australia do not tolerate travel well.
It’s safe to drink local tap water, but if you’re scared, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of cutting is foreign. A short coffee is an espresso, the cappuccino comes well loaded with cream (without foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Destroyed chocolate reaches Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but the quality is excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
However, it follows the recommendations of the authorities, respects all signals and pays close attention to security warnings.
Cubozuses are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770. Occasionally they can also be found outside these months.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and get away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not make active life in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as camps, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to submit other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any request or suggestion should be sent first to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
At some festivals, the overwhelming majority of attendees choose to camp there, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will need to arrive early to get a place to camp near the music.
It should be remembered that even if the music is finished on the main stages there may be sections of the festival that continue to play well into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice generates terrible noise in the most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include a time in the city. Passenger cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually strive to maximize the time and money their visitors leave behind. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment offers to encourage guests and prevent them from leaving the establishment.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages inside the house. However, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good "gamblers" know that it is important to stay sober.
Those driving at high latitudes or between mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice or very low temperatures.
Friction is low on icy and snowy roads, and you can’t drive there as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to get you trapped in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling snow or being displaced by the wind, or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the main tourist attraction in Africa and the most relevant for many tourists.
The term safari in popular usage refers to the journey over land to see the fantastic African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow good views.
Animals such as lions, cheetahs and leopards are occasionally shy, which is why you can see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "rural hike", "hiking safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, for hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were due to be held.
Most tickets to the event are expected to cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, with a typical ticket price of around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. In many hotels you can ask for an iron and an ironing board, even if there is no one in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not like to wear socks, then you can try to use a hair dryer, if it is available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (it could shrink or, in extreme cases, undercut).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water is enough for a minute; in others, it takes a few minutes.
The effectiveness changes from filter to filter, and in case of concerns you should consider buying water from a known brand in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter pests of animals they are not familiar with in their regions of origin.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of injuring or killing people by force, are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy tax-free goods in certain places.
Travelers bound to countries with high taxation can sometimes save themselves a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: steep slopes, narrow sections and closed curves predominate.
The speed limits indicated are noticeably lower than those of other earlier and later sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict obedience to the limits is even more important than if it were otherwise.
Although curious, the mobile phone service is more powerful here than in many other segments of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastry is quite good and that of Bavaria is much and very diverse, similar to that of Austria, its southern neighbors.
Pasta with fruit is common, with apples cooked inside the pasta all year round and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many baked German products also carry almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The best-known cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small, but flavorful pastries, try what the region calls Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is in common use.

The shoulders are supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They are more stable for the rider, but may present safety problems because the rider's feet could get trapped.
If a rider jumps from the horse but has a foot stuck in the strait, it could be dragged if the horse runs away. In order to minimize this risk several safety precautions can be taken.
For starters, most riders wear boots with a heel and a single slim and slim fit.
In addition, some saddles, particularly the English ones, have safety bars that allow the leather of the shoulder strap to fall off the mount if a rider pulls it back when falling.

Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, but it was in 1861 when some Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Travelling with a backpack on skis: this activity is also called rural skiing, ski tourism or ski hiking.
It is related to it, but generally does not involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter executed on faceted terrain and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
Imagine a ski trail as something similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel a little longer distances than walking - although on rare occasions you will achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on flattened slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between several countries would involve making many visa applications and passport checks.

While staying in this area, you can usually cross borders without having to pass passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa does not require applying for a visa for each of the Schengen countries separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for manufactured articles that are considered antiques. Some tax agencies determine that goods over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit may be lower in places such as North America compared to Europe.

The hangover currents are the flow that returns after the waves collide with the beach, often to a reef or similar.
Because of the topology of the water, the flow back is concentrated in a few deeper stations, and a strong current can form into deep waters.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from attempting to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, swimming backwards is no more difficult than usual.
Try to go somewhere where you are not captured again or, depending on your abilities or if you have been informed, you may want to wait for a rescue.

Finland is an important shipping destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don’t need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although any yacht can pass through the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sports sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
This is equated with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is also quite special (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruise ships make an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Courier companies charge well to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandising or replacement parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If things were sent by plane, there are routes where unloading and customs clearance can take days.
The only way to send it faster, was to do it as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger carrying it, and this is where you enter.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to pay a good bundle of money for this privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: you can usually expect to pay up to four times the price of the economy fare for the business class, and up to eleven times for the first class!
In general, it makes no sense to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay more for the privilege of arriving at a place quickly and conveniently, and pay accordingly.
