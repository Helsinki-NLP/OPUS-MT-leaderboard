A Republican strategy to hinder Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and states that election fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die as a result of lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line a majority of American governments enacted, as of 2009, new laws that made the registration or voting process difficult.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote were introduced in 41 states during 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
Therefore, the Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have an identity document with a photograph.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
Moreover, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit Hispanic voting.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
Republican lawmakers backed laws in 2011 that abolished voter registration on the same day in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wished to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored shortening the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted ahead of time were African Americans, while the latter accounted for no more than 13% of the state’s voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the same thing happened.
These represent no more than 11% of voters, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens voting in advance.
However, whites, who make up 76 percent of the electorate, make up only 46 percent of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
The damage could be limited in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have adopted such laws account for 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Getting Tested or Not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reticent on their own, doubt whether or not screening should be done.
Take the test or not?
We asked for advice from two specialists.
Studies conducted in the United States detected a high rate of contagion among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret those data and make strong recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of metastasizing if the screening test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer. They should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not threaten life in the long term, in which case you should opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it’s important to talk to your doctor to determine if you should get tested or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved around enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the declining number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people’s health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The Weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer,” they add.
The feeding
The agency also recommends limiting the consumption of red meats.
In large amounts, they increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcuterie products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat for smoking, drying or salting can cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment his investigations are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of discussing each other’s concerns and family history with their doctor.
"Doing the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What is more, it is the particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model: our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that this is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still lacking to be completely sure.
Anyway, we assume that this is about Higgs, since the chances of making a mistake seem small. We'll see what it's about.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law which implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There’s no way to break that rule and don’t try too hard, because you’ll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" consisting, roughly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And then there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
According to Berkeley Laboratories' The Particle Adventure website, which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it should be emphasized here, are not the exotic bugs that we could believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the “particle of light” that acts as a “messenger” of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disords” the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone at a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave is born (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon; that is, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field, and to activate it requires extremely high energies, a bit like an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide on the surface.
That’s why it takes an immense particle accelerator like CERN’s (the large hadron collider is a ring 27 km in circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what can all these investigations "contribute?", asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and predictions of the MS.
For their part, many fervently wish to be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it proposes no explanation relative to gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such research on our day-to-day lives are difficult to predict, but we do not think we are wrong to say that you will not have any.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They interviewed the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, said, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light pickup in 1969 in the course of his research in optics.
Although it was not his original intention at all, this pickup now serves as an “eye” for all the digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That doesn’t mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
In its Dying in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir tried to see him up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
“I had been given five years to live, but I’ve had seven,” he says, making a pass, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois hospice in Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resignation to be helped to eat.
Brave, he even gets to smile, to talk to strangers who dedicate attentions to him, bring him medicines and offer him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
“My biggest wish is for diarrhea to be cured, it’s humiliating,” she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
“In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing up,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Going back to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” she says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois hospice have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The biggest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is dying "consciously and drowned."
But the disease has made him discover his children.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
“I don’t have any more desires left in this life,” she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And she expects, in the coming days, a final visit from her son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance.
They are palliative care that is given when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the lawsuit.
Diabetics are no longer able to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois centre, the days go by without ever being the same.
Alongside a 94-year-old man savoring his last family reunion in the yard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, having tried everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 with cancer," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois center and the home palliative care society of the Grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack of health care in Quebec that causes many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by palliative care eminences, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before the euthanasia procedure is accepted.
"Recently," she says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering from severe pain without having been relieved.
I’m afraid patients want to die just because they don’t get the right care.”
And at the same time, many oncologists are obstinate with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard’s survival hopes were already low when she left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not having met their demands once their pain has been alleviated thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say all the same: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want relief.”
This report was made possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which are part the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers too much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system is sprayed once we’ve hunted down the big media,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by a thorough investigation into embezzlements linked to road contracts in Quebec, which Liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved $1 billion in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission “has already knocked down two mayors,” he adds, while hoping to be able to “demonstrate the ploys existing behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government actors, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the policemen of the "Marteau squad", who, since 2009, have made the "sewer cartel" of Montreal moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded with the serial search of fraud and corruption allegations against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public procurement.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and businessmen of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock when explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For three years he paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to right and left during the 2000s, granting more than C$88,000 (about $68,000) to provincial parties, mostly the liberals in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
The inflation of the cost of sewage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of 736,000 dollars, all in exchange for sewage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating the bills between 30 and 40 percent as fake extras.
In addition, a mayor’s party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and drove Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of a municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money
From the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she assures that she pulls "a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fish the culprits".
He added that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We are cleaning the wounds but it would take a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert so that the dubious practices do not repeat.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is concerned above all about the role of “elected politicians who are aware of the ploy.”
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: “I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes limiting donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It advocates a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "we can not fall lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that advancement?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I walk by your side every day.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But they don't heat me up.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by leaps and bounds.
He will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
It is backed by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course you did.
Ancelotti inspires respect to all the technicians.
Today, there is no one like him in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of PSG in the first half of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken away our leading position.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the round of 16 in style.
What is the club’s goal in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, to start, to finish the first of our league against Porto to be able to receive the round of 16.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is committed to its means for this project to be realized.
Not winning the cup in League One, as in last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
Last season we didn’t go far.
In May we got a disappointment, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expect more from PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, that they still find things to reproach us is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, has not managed to qualify for the round of 16, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
“It shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Let's say we have a "Zlatandependence."
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and scores a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's the star of League One.
And he has shown in all the teams he has gone through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating play time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I can play good matches in the national team.
It is what I expected since my baptism with the "blues".
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and that is why we are exemplary in our behaviour today.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps’ first month at the head of the “bleus”?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on October 16 in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn’t experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, Pay and Sell Without Banks
The opposite is true of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as is often the case in technology, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer files.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching the top of $ 30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning today to around ten dollars (quotes are censused on the page bitcoincharts.com).
It’s nothing impressive when compared to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competing with the dollar or euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as “credits”, used to advance a video game and which can be earned by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositories of ledgers, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the form of email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins are recorded in the public book of accounts, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through solving a mathematical challenge thrown at the computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
It is a phase of file slicing, that is, transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "splitting" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (plus zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is split in two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred million, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposit have been stolen.
“The failure used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibility of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Big players like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Insitute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the “giant sales” were launched.
“They exchanged $30,000,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, should this currency succeed.
We are out of Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops abandoned their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the maimed.
The Taliban has foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to the French credits, was done by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx into Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country shrouded in fire and blood because of fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants surpassed by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, seizing government land to resell as land for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting alongside huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have taken advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under the age of 25, Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to give jobs to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is eager for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish pamphlets presenting a modern world has great admirers all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the post of prime minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been repaired, and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract the iron ore or copper from the land and without means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, letting international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavate the immense Buddha site and remain there as the province’s most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girls' schools, children's schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and had brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These jobs, greedy of obtaining local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increase of cultivation areas.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of very harsh local living conditions in those valleys often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civilian aid that reaches them directly.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
It took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Only a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And for nearly two years Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial impasses.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his “autocratic delirium” and continues “betraying his word” and “trampling on the right.”
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that this is a measure to quickly end the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he claimed in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either vote my text or I maintain the full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist for the most part, voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, yesterday morning 11 people, substitute members, were added in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles voted unanimously.
The commentators are gracious, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all glances, remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that “the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than an advertising gimmick.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who is to confirm its conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are further heightened by the fact that the next rector of such a university would be much less moderate than the current one.
“For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on that text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to rule above all this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to what they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Prosecutions of civilians in military courts, as called for by human rights associations, will also not be prohibited.
These also showed their concerns regarding the text, which they consider liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy remains, and henceforth insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially the freedom of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes women’s protection, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive was the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was scheduled to go out on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are awaited by the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
“AIF” identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the nets filled.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here walk the Via Crucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Vía Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Anthony, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, going to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of the Anointing and to the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then come true.
Take a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who are dedicated to climbing can.
Others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
There, bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, at the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in the country.
In one trip you won’t be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases by Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bath Al Basha, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth stopping by the exclusive private Ralli museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops.
Entry is free, and donations are not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop from 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salt water, brine and healing muds and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to get their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous sea route that linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets bearing the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls in the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "taking" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for night concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently 1-3$,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transferring for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night until sundown on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport disrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning, a new working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, great variety of sauces, the faláfel, which are balls of ground chickpeas, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities no stray dogs are seen.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that “walk to their liking” in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Snorers love crowded places and don’t refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012 more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
The majority of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds by 51% the same index of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for language
While MEPs and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the law on compulsory examination, there have already been scammers in the country who trade with "false" certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
On 1 December, a law came into force, according to which every working immigrant must take an exam to check their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service provision sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become compulsory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to pass the examination of the language, but also that of Russian history and that of the foundations of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The exception is citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who were able to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the Peoples ' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to present themselves for the tests in all cities, right now in Russia are open more than 160 centers of this type.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
In the first place, respond the representatives of the Immigration Service, this will allow to reduce the number of people who suffer "labour slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of working immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are the immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical check-up.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, put a "paid trip" to a creepy and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages,” confirms the Head of the Directorate of Labour Immigration of the Tajik Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get mad, little boss!
In the meantime, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, let alone to dress them, wear shoes and buy them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It’s hard, if you don’t know the language, they recognize.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, rights defenders pointed to an important point.
The exams will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbid the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic hurdles and difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and extortion cases appear.
"They are asking for 100 or 200 rubles for cigarettes or tea," Umed Hushkadamov, a Tajik national, told reporters.
"Come on, don't be shy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law’s entry into force, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be fake.
Several “false” certificates of language proficiency have already been seized by Federal Immigration Service officials.
The counterfeit documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the foreseeable future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who would not have been able to pass the exam the first time longer to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the reaction of the government to the recent incidents: Shooting during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Squeeze seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on the possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the “hard-handed policy”.
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of “senseless rigor” be abandoned.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, commented to the BBC news service of Russia, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared to the total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to head to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to official
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Víctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website accepting weapons orders
The first, "vestige of the army or military", that is, weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves," Baranets said.
The next type of "black weapon",the ones stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditatedly set to cover the fault," said a former military official.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their grain of sand.
“Now private weapons factories have proliferated that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including that of Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” explains the former military officer.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data of portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the investigators, 17% of the weapons come from places where there is armed conflict, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The clerk of one of the gun shops, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
Most often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This one brings the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when you have to comply with the crime discovery plan, they make test purchases from illegal arms dealers," he adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
“I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the ‘Begovaya’ platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a ‘skin’ where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I found out only there.”
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
In the markets there are vendors, but there you also have to get there, say "on the part of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that his daughter had a tooth dropped."
I can even get a pair of steel gloves through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to betray him.
Novices look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets was put to the test as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
They handed him a photo album where there was “nothing at all”.
“I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,” recalls the military officer.
To the buyer, in the words of Baranets, they do not offer cat for hare: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
“They give me a chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop of sofas
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
For this, no documents or personal meetings are required.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the headline of the ad “Buy a gun or machine gun.”
There users place their orders and ask questions.
Do they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (conserved spelling).
"I buy gun TT. Moscow", laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures with two hands those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
Military commentator and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions to let him know where the gun is hidden," said Dmitri Kislov, press secretary of the NGO The Right to Guns.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an order is placed online, one runs out of a gun and is put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures with two hands those who want to buy firearms.
“And people go, like starving fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Guns", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
A month and a half will have to wait.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of U.S. fast food restaurants and supermarkets go on strike
Up to a quarter of U.S. teens find their first jobs as cashiers at "McDonald's"
In recent days, in the United States, a wave of protests against the low wages paid in the supermarkets of the Walmart corporation and in restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and calm down in its early stages.
The protests are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the rise in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those in the fast food system, the goal of the protest organizers is the creation of workers’ unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", that day, in the United States began the orgy of sales that captured millions of inhabitants, and was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
That day, workers at the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, quit their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and left-wing activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products are aimed at people of modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the largest supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or handheld scanners.
That “Black Friday” protesters demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 an hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will result in only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters are satisfied that the protest took place in just nine states and did not cause any losses to the corporation.
“Black Friday” ran from 8 p.m. on Thursday through midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold around 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers carried out "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that they left their jobs "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been just "another public relations stunt" organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not precisely Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city have no appreciation for them, and so for now there are none), but "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even give you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, under federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York receive $8.90 an hour.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it’s possible to survive in New York with that money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teens went to McDonald’s and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble on some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that ATMs and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, or double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that unions of workers be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from denying them this right and punishing trade union activists with cunning and firings.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive turnover of staff.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place midway through the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, in particular City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, City Mayoral Candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must support fast-food workers to achieve fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not even all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which they worked tens of thousands of people from New York.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a mass movement.
“For now, cheating the brain isn’t that easy.”
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is perceived with normality lately mainly through the prism of special glasses.
In early summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft lab in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was elucidated that for the scientists of that company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted to the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to the person-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
Even though Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design technologies.
The world of computing must be liberated from ours, from the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, it can not be considered a panacea, it is pending to solve the issue of privacy, since we do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in their own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- What's that like?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- That is, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects human-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
Is it not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible fingerboard sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn’t presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smartphone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from the glasses to the smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that is their strength (private things only you can see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie "Iron Man", but also to any simple mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
The hands feel nothing!
What responses does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at bringing tangibility to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation similar to that one feels if someone was blowing it on the fingertips, but that sensation is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain?
Making him think that he feels what he seems to feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to struggle with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, cheating the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality appealing to researchers, who find many things in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg Vanguardism", dedicated to the citizens who stand in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the St. Petersburg scene, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s-early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organist of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I am dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, image makers and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray arouses aggression and agitation of not good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the later ones being exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is already over.
I went into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
It was important for me to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to meet.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there existed a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the bohemian house of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonograms, wore tight trousers, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regular customers.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was "People of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go apart. One can be popular but very uncultivated.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them the topicality and occurrence is clearly expressed.
I'm doing a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum on Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and frightening.
But in clowns everything is blurred and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now they follow one by clothes, orienting themselves on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, perhaps that person should not even shake his hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
We recently saw you in the role of urban organist. - A cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have tact.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before, people were grouped into packs, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simple ones wanted another.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov they come by thousands!
- The abandoned ones will see, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event 300 people go, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to cheat them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that’s another story.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is a concept: a culture official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were the right ones everything was different, kings may not have understood the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because we need experts at a higher level who properly assess these and make their way.
Subjective personal taste is now thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is ground.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a St. Petersburg grant.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set off in search of a spare planet.
To conserve humanity the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
“These are Venus and Mars,” says the chief researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora.
For half a century now, experiments with plants have been carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit differed in nothing from the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophiles.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops under conditions of weightlessness.
We get as a result a normal chick.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they found no support, the chicks gave random turns.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
"And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological “miniarch” flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
“This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our gull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question,” says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of spaceflight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a child.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The Cosmonaut Preparation Centre hydro-laboratory is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is his birth element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation is necessary, the force of gravity.
In weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepit very quickly, the expulsion capacity of the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omit that, relying on the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
It is impossible for a newborn in orbit to wear a special training suit, as for adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled, a totally misfit person,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical matter.
However, in time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their space-born children.
Head of NK<0xC3><0x9A>: The inspection of the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system has not found the guilty politician
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is lame.
This is what Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Office of Supreme Control (NK<0xC3><0x9A>) says in an interview for Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," thus describes the current situation.
The joint controls of Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the SDG (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor demand obligations," Kala said.
At the meeting of the audit committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started doing about two years ago.
To put it simply: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by the practice itself.
We have brought everything together and, although the control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "stricter and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is confirmed, therefore, that it is not enough to incorporate ever stricter rules, but it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think the conclusions are?
Precisely a common control of this kind could help us to stop investing efforts in the concreteness of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
Savings economics means getting a suitable thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by lowering the limit on awards means that we are going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much paperwork, those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NK<0xC3><0x9A> or is it organized in another way?
As far as the offices, such as the NK<0xC3><0x9A>, are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in his case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also somewhat analogous, however, since Germany has a federal organisation, the courts of account are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which here we call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
Generally, I would not like to make a comparison without concrete data; however, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be specified exactly where it is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
That’s for sure not, but, I repeat, I don’t like to make such comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as our model must face a large number of problems.
If that were not the case, you wouldn't benefit from collaborating with our office, would you?
As regards the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean for your Office? Is its impact manifest in any way?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex-post checks, there must be a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparation of future controls: we have started a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public tenders, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process and the like are rectified.
Do you consider that the passage of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope it will be.
The problem that may arise is that the regulations are "hardened" and that it is impossible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulations, the persons controlled were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law not respected in the area of public procurement meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal failure, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this path leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA1>varc system, referring to the fact of being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA1>varc" system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the Prime Minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such controls and demand obligations.
You can say, “We change the law and allow it,” but you can’t say that we’re going to act like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how to act formally, and this is how it should be to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal demands.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice sheets, although for the most part they are passable
In several parts of the Czech Republic, roads are covered with ice and snow.
Although most roads are passable, caution should be exercised in some.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but presented ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will range between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region’s road operations control center.
The R6 highway and the first-class road in the region are now unrestrictedly passable.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
All second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some of them there are still sections with remnants of ice and snow.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in East Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports the Roads and Highways Directorate in its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frost may occur in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysokého M<0xC3><0xBD>ta, and especially on second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains from Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow trampled on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In the area of East Bohemia, the sky today will be between clear and partly cloudy, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three below zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable this morning, but caution must be exercised and the weather must be adjusted.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some tracks could also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will improve progressively.
This is what is clear from the information of the road operations control center of the region.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most top-notch roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany there may be stretches with ice sheets.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case, sections with ice sheets are also warned.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less busy roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the higher areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>.
Road operators cleared snow overnight; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are unrestricted.
"In the highest areas of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, there is still snow.
Drivers in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské will encounter half-snow in the direction of Jeseník", confirmed today a <0xC5><0xA0>umper road management operator at the <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also went to the Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are unrestricted, on the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberská road drivers should drive cautiously on forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem region and Liberec region
The operators of the roads in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept below freezing, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the roadway. On the other hand, in the lowest areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
At the moment, no service complications have been reported.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surroundings of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day it is expected rain and snow that melts and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from the general roads on road I/13, on the border between the region of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched over the road with the weight of the snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world is coming, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many alarmist news that we like to cling to.
The Tap Tap music group likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
This is a state charity that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar set for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, shirts, bags and original key rings against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "End of the world, cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, will it be heard in charity concerts?
Of course, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time in the three concerts.
The anthems will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák has written the lyrics to this song and plays the lead role of Jesus in the music video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charities and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised in the concerts against the end of the world be used for?
An equipment for the barrier-free educational centre Studyo, which we have completed for the sixth year in a row with the civil association Tap in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav.
Students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ustav school regularly receive visits from teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert several groups and performers perform.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any other similar “spectacular action” in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage that we are in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have performed for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as hard as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which is not surprising.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still rare for a person to move alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been set up, striving to thematize the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what respects should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are a lot of things we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with severe disabilities to move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this aspect, with The Tap Tap let’s go a little further!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, it will begin to really change everything.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if you look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav, where I had many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not reach until these last years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that work that is not seen is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also afford quality teaching, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that something else can be done.
The world of entertainment is full of things that resemble each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction.
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and whom we should have compassion for.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not just a breakthrough for them, but for the whole of society.
Did it help the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds and when they learn that they have to come two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something done.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: La<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We are an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate.
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to jointly sing The Tap Tap's song "End of the World, Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational centre in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav in Prague, which costs 25 million CZK.
Admission to the concert costs CZK 400 and children up to 12 years have free entry at the early sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the Cosmos.
Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week and is the second ESA member of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland’s path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the lecture of A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the craters on the far side of the moon.
Already in 1925 a dreszina was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and neither are the details of the project known.
It is unclear whether the rocket was to be used for start-up of the dresin or for braking.
The information about this dressin is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes apparent that the investigation has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In the year 1937 appeared in the specialized press the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, society is referred to for the first time with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, it was proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, PTA was significantly involved in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) probe rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959, aerial testing of the RM-2 two-stage rockets began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>dów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was going to be the object of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was going to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
On the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, on the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and on the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, the first aerial tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the law on social work.
The resolution aroused heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this "provokes a drop" in the price of the competitor in order to take over the majority of the market and, in this way, increase its profit margin.
On a large scale, it means for most entrepreneurs to move production abroad, buy cheaper or disappear, resulting in high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility whatsoever and, therefore, is not responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, it necessarily increases the social expenditure of the state.
This whole situation leads to the total disinterest of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damages they have caused in their quest for profits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and, thus, attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own populations regardless of social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees as regards labour rights.
The result is increasing poverty along with increasing gaps between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years now, food delivery points for the poor have existed in Germany and they cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already one million.
In the context of the increasing competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary for survival.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of practically all the southern EU states lead, without a doubt, to the same situation: People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to live with a poor wage at the limit of society, in the hope that one day private investor capital will reach the country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the full that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its egoism the political march and, therefore, the whole state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the realm of corruption, in mutual favour, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, entrust the drafting of bills to private legal companies, which are often linked to industry.
These types of bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like that described by Appianus in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for some time and the administrations were occupying themselves by force".
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread without any impediment and the people went to the polls with the vote worded in advance"... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "Pompe was always thought to be transformed in serious that the only remedy for such a serious situation was self-defense...
The conclusion, as in antiquity, is that today’s society is based on disregarded preferences of individual benefit without regard to common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole of society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, awaiting the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and more recent history.
Suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution; at least not in the long run.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other avenues to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution involves concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are".
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, diverse reactions have emerged.
One, on Israel’s side, argues for the right to self-defense and places Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and denounces Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the periodic killings and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a behind-the-scenes look, a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small area of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
In every epoch we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so evident is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who oriented their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been reached in a single generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
In the nineteenth century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have major holdings in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Rothschilds’ central bank Bank of America, began during the Civil War to print money and was murdered in 1865 at the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their eagerness for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to chart a plan with three world wars, designed by Freemason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially of Britain, and the third aimed at reducing the population of the land between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (such a solution for ecumenism is nothing more than one).
The method by which the group of the richest families operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the unleashing of crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, erroneous, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the Fed was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francis Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after, as a result, the First World War was unleashed, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a covert manner, a conflicting situation in the wake of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough for them to serve the Germans with a strong Che and blamed for the Führer's solution, which was so strong and simple to build.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds pushed for the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration laid the groundwork for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place began.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which he was originally tied by international bankers or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus for a third war was created.
If international bankers succeeded in initiating it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim on the front line of combat, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine for welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the strait of Hormuz, where it passes 20% of the world’s crude oil only has a wide corridor.
In what light are now the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
And it compels all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two foreheads, let him add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo Movie: If It Gets Raw, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist student protesters occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned shah Mohamed Reza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the U.S., a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive prospects: throwing the shah overboard could not afford it, since if it did, it jeopardized the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter’s defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck thematizes an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees of the building escaped.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for it helped a covert story an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the shooting of a science fiction superproduction.
Combination of genders
The plan outlined by "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the series Ocean's Eleven).
In the film, moods are combined. We find on the one hand well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the sequence of credits are shown emblematic photographs of the time of the events, which were captured in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And besides, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the hallways of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the subject of mockery, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is her third feature film, after "Small Goodbye, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he was raised.
Likewise, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is “wheeling” in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events.The introductory sequence of the takeover of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of bewilderment and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here it doesn’t all come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis lurks at the airport in Tehran, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its runway turn into madness).
Argo’s weakness is the out of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of a dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, value its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But if it collapses, that'll be hard.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd rules or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU is planning to approve a 40 percent quota of women in management positions in large European companies," said Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the nonsense nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Up until now, women were advantaged by better life insurance prices because they objectively represent a lower risk.
“Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of lifetime mercury thermometers just because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the dark guideline on the size of hen cages, which has contributed to this year's considerable increase in egg prices.
The factual ban on using the term "smelling butter" or the removal of the classic light bulb from shops has been criticised.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often takes such decisions under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas should be at least 14 centimeters long in the EU and could not present “abnormal curvatures”.
The European Commission defended itself by saying that with this it only seeks to harmonize the national rules not homogenized to date, which only complicated their commercialization.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the grounds that the existing directive entails a waste of groceries.
The candidate to win the poll could be last year’s U.S. prescription that inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The US referred here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of infant death by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to the use of matasuegras by children up to the age of 14.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, one must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnipoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, named in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
Afterwards, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volume for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of a substantial fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application of grants.
Such ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
“We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation," agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) said in autumn 2004.
He argued this with the fact that in our country a lot of cereals were produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had its warehouses full and it had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereal from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of grant applications from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often the target of criticism, the EU's efforts in the field of regulations and also a more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but that member states have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs, as well as other countries of the Union, are also in the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc cottage cheese, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the nineteenth century, and went on to be called "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugarcane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known throughout the world, the marzipan of the German city Lübeck or the ham of Parma, there are already for example the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the carp of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and of T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> and, even, the variety of lúpul.
As EU protected maras, you can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice v Podkrkono<0xC5><0xA1>í barks.
People want me to save the republic, but I’m an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If everything was fine in our country, then I wouldn’t be running for office.
But I can no longer bear to see how robbers have been robbed in our country for the last twenty years, how thieves go unpunished, taxes are raised and the retirement age is raised.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run for senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has set out for the presidency.
Isn’t he turning his back on those who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the senate elections.
I later stated that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas a reality.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we trample anyone who wants to start a change.
To this are added the media, which discredits you and confuses freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said of me that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and property declaration over twenty million.
To do this, you must change the law.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobbying group for the guiding profession to be recognized as self-employment, and we did it.
The problem is in politics: if someone arrives with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is deliberately rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without boxing or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from every party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be a right-wing or a left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
For me it doesn’t matter, whether it’s a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we move forward.
I don’t care if someone is right-wing or left-wing, I want to unite people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the SDG and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
He jokes about you being a populist.
But aren't you proving it by what you're saying?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get closer to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I talk about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament, there are only slogans left.
It cannot survive in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I have no choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to put them on my side to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want to.
If there is a strong character pointing to disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Let us take for granted the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I just started in politics and try to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to get things through myself, but in case it doesn’t work out, in six years I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that with one person I do nothing, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy for the senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the scams with light heating oils.
I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I’m on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
The people chose the senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time to do it, to check the impeccable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
Speaking of property statements, what's yours like?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of works of art valued at ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at $60 million and you don’t have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to be in debt?
In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there isn’t too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign with money out of my pocket.
The expenses of the campaign cover in essence what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, I couldn't pay my son for the English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn’t run for office.
So you're going to keep your business going in order to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have partly quit my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
The people would want it to be the Samaritan who would save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep winning.
If I were president, then I'd quit business.

The architecture studio MVRDV shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly finished "mountain of books" - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there’s finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "Moreover, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library nowadays.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody gets into those old-fashioned libraries for fun, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town on the outskirts of Rotterdam that barely deserves a brief visit, holds the dubious honor of having set a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this embarrassing situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear represented on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how policymakers decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture firm MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings at the same time cynical, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked around in perplexity and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size into a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: “Dear fellow citizens:
Here it is, my proposal for Spijkenisse’s mountain of books, the so-called ‘Boekenberg’.
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain rises at the planned location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential buildings and townhouses.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town devoid of history, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheesecake.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to embrace with the view, the annealed brick floor and elegant streetlights unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up you can see the park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the center a huge dark room opens up which is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to turn the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well taken advantage of: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserve the black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is how one day, on a Frisian farm, we came across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands a plastic fabric of few millimeters thickness has been used as a base to hold the roots of the crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to obtain plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
“Although it’s hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology,” Trouborst says.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Even though the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences located transversely to the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is the stuff of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Likewise, the professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV studio has achieved a success in that queen discipline that in the specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The town of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uneducated he may be.
Finally a starting point for shaping your identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a more prominent role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather troubled diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany hinted that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status at the United Nations.
Eventually, however, Berlin abstained.
What's the point?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from establishing a no-fly zone.
It has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, I do.
This is because at the moment it is reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to doing so.
I think they are still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they have already started the path towards a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What exactly does a “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, shows a willingness to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced your stance on the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, she must be careful not to alienate herself from Arab public opinion or Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it that much importance since it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the Palestine vote?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German stance enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think that there has been such a drastic break as in the case of Libya.
Germany may have gained some respect from this.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great deal of understanding towards the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the magnitude that is attributed to it.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that’s precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but must propel things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it maintains with Israel.
This has always been a perilous subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Do you see Germany as an important international actor? Do you really want Germany to take on a leading role?
Or is it still hard for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still struggles to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as a major player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The U.S. influence on European politics is decreasing more and more, but the EU is not filling that void at the moment, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prominent role.
Even if they do not like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular village, c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name hides a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the reason.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in Far East protection rights violations.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and in place of Prada Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as happened to the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a file cabinet in which it holds seats of the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are department stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are of a different nature and, on behalf of his clients, he is fighting against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word originates from the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan".
It refers to women who have “fished” a rich man.
The Chinese government does not feel guilty.
“It’s detrimental to the business, you have to fight it,” Pattloch says.
“The brand makes waters, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous.”
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are millionaire, especially in the case of luxury flagship products.
According to data from market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion a year, China is the third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also requires a lot of money.
Processes can last up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had elapsed so long that the name at issue in the lawsuit had already become a “market reality.”
“If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged the plagiarist’s brand in China,” Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that was recently absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why today the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo’s buyer, Geely, initially used a blue and white logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the case was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
Clothing maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the labor emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed claims processes has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending.
Fighting this costs a lot of money.
As is usual in China, the numbers are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the 10th year in a row, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed in terms of duties.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg demonstrates.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese impersonator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has succeeded in securing Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO also dismissed the appeal of the Munichers.
In the next two instances Freudenberg has been given the right, but the opposite side is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending a decision.
Wentzler hoped to be able to settle the matter favourably and praised the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review records up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a “six-figure sum in euros” with the aim of reaching a friendly settlement, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe,
In particular, if the imitators secure there the rights to unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since left this commercial area, but has managed to prevent registration.
“We have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and attorney Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what must be done is "to register also in China everything that may be susceptible to protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the subject can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, should Freudenberg lose the last round of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party licensing rights by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a bond capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heels and loafers look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly begin to rise (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano), swirling, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost get out of his way as he tries to bring order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
The 50 singers, aged between 23 and 69, have also arrived, from the human geneticist to the owner of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language barely known: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are approximately 34 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV positive.
The association Voices for Africa has found in Germany sponsors for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "panegirist" in Zulu.
In this room no one knows how to speak fluently this Bantu language, but singing does.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
8,733 kilometers away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that relies on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not welcome circumcision, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s inhabitants are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying just over thirty years old has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they mostly saw were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
In the beginning it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since professionally taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the STDs of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Scabies and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur most often in men who have sex with other men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungal) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were recorded in 2011.
This is one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and are therefore undetected.
How can one protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but they do not offer 100 percent protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend having regular medical examinations, especially if you change sexual partners frequently.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they raise a lot of money.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini itself, a self-confident and leadership-minded woman manages the money sent from Germany.
He takes care that the orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof over their heads, and take care that children go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, managed to get many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not an obvious thing, since, despite how obvious this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually talked about openly.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excess-filled lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficially accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless seasonals who travel the country from one side to the other and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, “You can get free condoms on any corner, but they’re barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two to three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost part of the African continent still remember from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to tear a couple of tears from some angry border soldier.
The journey always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population barely appears on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is well known.
“Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines,” say the locals.
And after riding the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there is also ice water, as shown by three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It seems that this one is at least 30 centimeters long and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, with great probability, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger chief researcher Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
In a completely inadvertent way for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no “planet.”
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantly named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This whirlwind image of a dying star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made up of the material the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars form from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in a spectacular color.
This budding star was able to be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It is probably the remains of one of Saturn’s moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble Telescope: the Swirl Galaxy.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this zone of star formation into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic flare: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies bounce toward each other to end up colliding irretrievably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it by the nickname Southern Mill.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light-years away is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and x-rays taken by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, served for a time as a model for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars are also continually emerging; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when most hydrogen could be found in the universe.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope is being built.
It allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the so-called European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 we do not expect to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
Mauna Kea is planning to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of what it would look like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes to us from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for light from the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers start from the base that at the south pole of Mercury there is also ice.
However, there is no reliable evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have the certainty that it is so.

The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great noise through the winding road that passes beside wooded hills, high-flowing rivers and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is located in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people of which not much is known, apart from that they dominate perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts an architecture perhaps too massive designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit at all in such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, becomes too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this hidden region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the World's Oldest People's Contest," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen Talyshis of the place who have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is sheep shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate to certify this.
And if we consider that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov’s age is quite suspicious.
“He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Has <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov then been wrong in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan, very old people also live," Scholz says, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil record either.
Every day glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly frequently, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva, a young man living in a small village.
At 97 years old, he is relatively young for what is stylized in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, she tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
Two young children are also jumping from one side to the other.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that they serve in typical cups with domed shape.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief she hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son discovers us proudly.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen off and has kept its color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I’ve never been to a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything went back to normal when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult of the father figure of the nation, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when he handed over the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s gray son is right: “in our culture the elders are very respected.”
They live in a big family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
In the Constitution, the expression “Human Rights” is missing.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is immersed.
The future constitution, with sharia as its basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
“We need to overcome the transition.
And that it happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, so far undoubtedly in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost apologizing, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his powers “in order to save the revolution.”
However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour evening meeting, are truly troubling.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does that mean by “principles”?
This was and still is open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal room for manoeuvre that comes with it, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia law.
This is at least what a new added article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia, it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great power in all of Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that – in fact – would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
This is a formulation so imprecise in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
To be clear, this is all about censorship.
Certainly, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legates.
However, it is unclear what an offense is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally dubious is the formulation that forbids "offense to people"
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for his signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks in the face of the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to make the Act fail before it could take effect.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third on the presidential election lists.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution should be “in the trash bin of history.”
On Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead a "coup d'état against democracy."
"When he calls the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow it," said Jasser Said, a former opposition leader.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," Egyptian opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim community, for its part, called for a counter-demonstration, perhaps not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, at the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it to the cry of: "the people demand the application of the divine law".
They demanded that Morsi “cleanse the country,” while proclaiming: “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi’s supporters did not want to risk that such a thing would happen.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution would have voiced their views loud and clear.
Now would be the time to let the people decide in the ballot box what direction the country should go.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed a majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
“And now the expression ‘Human Rights’ doesn’t even appear in the new constitution,” he laments in a conversation with the “Welt am Sonntag” newspaper.
The extension of Mursi’s powers to the three powers of the state caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control."
Norwegian rakfisk: the most smelly fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country has anything to do with its greed for an extremely smelly fish?
Take a series of over-cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway’s delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It is snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water for, depending on how smelly you prefer, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating delicacy.
“You eat it raw and then drink a glass of aquavit from a drink,” says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the “General of Rakfisk,” who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small buckets and drinking from a drink significant amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it’s not bad; it’s not much different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty plagued Norway and in which, before there was refrigeration, the fish was kept during the autumn immersed in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the senses inactive due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even not too much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered important, an essential, albeit rather smelly, part of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you a whopping <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it to be so.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the July 22 event.”
The Norwegians find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
Following much of Norway’s current wealth is the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she walks past trays of rakfisk, which, with its long blond hair and striking blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, wise people.”
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like to show off."
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; everything except a small percentage of the money coming from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn’t have in the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a laugh.
I'm in the snow queuing to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is undoubtedly something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, that stinking fish comes back.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held in which diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A television has connected live with a presenter carrying a bow tie and who is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant discusses the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad nowadays.
In a city that, under the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Peña Nieto told President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Prior to meeting with the U.S. president, Mr. Peña’s previous political experience was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
A heavily populated and rapidly growing state, it surrounds the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and of the construction of infrastructures.
To get to the city you can drive by one of Mr. Peña Nieto’s new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with his name at the entrance of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he will achieve real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
“In particular, when it comes to security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so badly needs.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was overthrown by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition’s qualification of the new president’s lack of essence.
“He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic statesman and, above all, he’s a person who knows how to listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that’s not the impression many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under highway stretches is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called upon to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
Most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
“When I arrived at his house, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned,” Mrs. Buendía recalls.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross in which a single word is read: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family says has been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a rioter, a whistleblower.
What they want is for one to simply accept what they say and shut up.”
“But that cannot be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come with a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his tenure.
“I hope it’s the same kind of president that he was when he was governor,” says the PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with Bradley Manning’s allegations of abuse while in prison
Trial centers on Manning's time at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now claims to have suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecution’s pre-trial interrogation of Manning in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein said records of weekly visits of unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he was receiving.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence ' s request for dismissal of the case given that his imprisonment had been harsh and that this had already meant sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
In Friday’s hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers were filling out after Manning’s visits during his arrest at Quantico Military Prison, where he was incarcerated under maximum incarceration from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and written down his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had rated the caregiver’s treatment as “excellent” and the treatment received at the facility in general as “very professional.”
The forms show no allegations of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had spoken about those issues and had indicated to him that they would be dealt with, but that they had not recorded those issues on the register.
“They were writing ‘no incidents’ (after talking about the problems) but this doesn’t necessarily mean that I hadn’t mentioned any problems,” Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not denounced the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a board charged with examining the suicide intentions she had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said it had put him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below that of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was okay and (want) to stop being under injury prevention ... so that I could enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the Marines' base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage,” Manning said Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, alone.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointing at his eyes while he slept.
He said that if the caretakers could not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he made in Thursday’s statement that, after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates.
Manning had testified that he had never been given a chance to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge’s interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order given to him by the caretaker that he should drop the blanket with which he could have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic in his underwear or his flip-flops to injure himself but had not.
Manning testified that he had removed his underwear, flip-flops and glasses from his cell that night.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he had during his time in prison and drastically reduce his sentence should he be convicted in the war council, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanor offenses and defend other allegations deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules applicable to any detainee who is in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; says they remember Mexicans from those difficult times
Navarrette remarks that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely gone down the esplanade and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some signs indicated the way to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" and another for "Extranjeros".
I sat there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
Growing up in Central California, I’ve been called “Mexican” all my life.
This is ethnic shorthand, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as “Irish” or my friends in New York call themselves “Italians.”
Later I decided to be "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply an American.
I speak Spanish. Good enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary level of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when the President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, included: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment it is so likely that a Mexican stays in Mexico that he ventures to go to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create in North America a trade bloc in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma go to war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot of it.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed the door to opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, low level of education, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulders as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but, still, as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of the two countries.
In the meantime, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love to hear the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things further, as I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised “ambassadors” of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption, and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, friends.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unprepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful about how their relatives were treated much less long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the useless and usual discussions about who started first, heaps of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything to pieces whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become trapped in the regional turmoil.
Perhaps this will make their struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there is reason to think that his deadly deadlock situation could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems currently very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 is maintained, this week’s clashes have reinforced the falcons on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has been beaten up.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on Gaza’s 1.7 million people in one of the most miserable and populous corners of the planet, Israel has failed to wipe out Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a reborn regional power that had previously been Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the wealthiest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah party-militia dominates, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, to reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas’s cousins and its leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military question is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for some time.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the United States is firmer than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part because of the barrier that erodes the West Bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite being illegal under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why pamper those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will prevail, although the Arab Spring could alter his calculations.
Although Islamists who seize power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be addressing internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Initiating a war with the area’s superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains that preached by sensible people on both sides, most from the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the surrender of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the entry of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the impending attempt to gain a virtual status at the UN.
Mr. Obama also plays an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision for the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Tobacco generic packaging law goes into effect in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and diseased parts of the body appear on packets of a dull green color, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia’s pioneering generic tobacco and packaging law comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with a dull olive-green wrapper, frightening images of diseased body parts and depictions of children and babies who are ill because they are the children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small font type.
It is the world’s strictest regime for tobacco packaging.
Australia’s federal government says the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
It relies on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
“It can be seen that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say their business has benefited from the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the lawsuit for silicone skins and covers to cover the nasty images of the boxes had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in Australia's Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was expecting more stocks.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social media among the demographic sector to which the plan is aimed.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in plain sight, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign websites.
“If you market tobacco and you only have this little window left to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from “walking citizens” posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One might wonder if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble to make a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
Australia’s British American Tobacco said the industry is more focused on what the new regulations involve than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that neither of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering enforcing similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the compulsory inclusion of images in boxes.
They are currently compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“Photography doesn’t affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
“You take the cigar and you save the package,” Victor El Hage says as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
“Frankly, there’s only one reason I’d quit smoking: for my daughter.”
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack store in central Sydney, says uniform boxes make it harder for him to put them on the shelves.
“It usually took me an hour to unpack a delivery; now it takes me four,” Yu says.
“The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, that’s it, okay, it’s over and we close the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get a little bored
During this year’s Thanksgiving holidays, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention duty-free shops.
But more and more academics and child development experts are praising the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it is good that both we and our children get bored from time to time.
Boredom forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since, currently, most of us are connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits that boredom brings.
So should we accept boredom with good cheer?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And no.
But, we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book Boredom: A Lively History, published in 2011 by Yale University Press, says, it is not so.
“In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating back to the 1st century AD.
We also need to consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and raising the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “desiring, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you.”
He states that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the disruption of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time is slowly passing."
Boredom can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem as their own.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a journal article.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to a full-volume TV show that had no relation, others listened with the low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the show with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they struggled to concentrate, but were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, disruption of attention can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like spotting faulty parts on a manufacturing line, music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or scribbling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, as they make that person physically more alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, an especially boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a “boring trend scale” in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues like “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don’t have time to do it all.”
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while they were at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest," in large part because both children and teens are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: Is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, it can make us expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Boring is the way your brain tells you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or dosage himself,” says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dosage applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain themselves, but learns to control themselves better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire that is too distressing and disturbing to relate to something worthwhile,” she says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Consumption Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and footballer in southeast Colorado, faces criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal statewide: the possession of some marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by the police.
Police found marijuana in the car and a time later Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (minor offenses each involving a fine of 100 U.S. dollars) informing him of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor drug-holding lawsuits depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misdemeanors for marijuana possession are being overturned both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law comes into effect in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s most conservative district attorneys have pledged to move forward with marijuana possession cases and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of recently licensed marijuana stores in their communities.
“This is all changing so quickly that I don’t know what’s next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police at Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in Washington state are also turning the issue around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licensing – all before the deadline, December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that can serve as a model,” he says.
The Washington law, dubbed I-502, comes into force on December 6, which also leaves a year during which you will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but the possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to provide “adequate access” to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of conducting cannabis businesses within 300 meters of schools, parks, children’s playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On November 21, Oates, Aurora’s police chief, e-mailed his police officers that the city prosecutor would stop filing charges for minor misconduct for possession of marijuana to people over the age of 21 and that the police would stop filing charges against those crimes “with immediate effect.”
Police Chief Oates said they would enforce the city’s regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and vendors.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those misdemeanors that at the time they occurred were criminal,” Buck said in a statement.
The response has been tricky even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Grand Junction police, the county’s largest city, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
“I don’t think he’s wasting his time in continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana use to the government and the judiciary was going to be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier to district attorneys,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney representing those accused of marijuana possession and a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of the Marijuana Act.
“They’ve spent so much time taking people to court that, in reality, they still can’t accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the nationwide test cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving directions from the federal government, which still envisions considering the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization are hopeful that the Justice Department will give in.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed businesses to sell marijuana for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
“While anti-drug agents are likely not to throw down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities aren’t waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favor of what the community voted for versus voting in favor of what the state voted for."
A lot of questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed to get kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
College students are not attacked for their views just now
I don’t remember any time in my life when I wasn’t dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary-era Greek symposium that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue a history degree, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had given up because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer A. N. Wilson joked that I had left because I was forced to drink in peeled cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that it came from a private school.
I was harassed for only one reason, which at the cradle of the supposed illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering what that is now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of Conservative students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s JCR (grouping of undergraduate students) claim that they are “often seriously sidelined, personally attacked and treated as unpleasant people” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their college’s equal opportunities committee to make sure they can express their views freely.
Their situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and portraying the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former chairman of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver grip.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated like “Turkish heads” by introducing higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the University of Nottingham Conservative Party Association, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
“People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says the environment is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19, an elected president of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment as well as the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old.
The hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an "honoris causa" title after cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that the professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery of conservative university students, but also willingly participated in it.
The policy of the miners’ strike, privatization and the government’s opposition to the apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached as far as the wooden halls of the seminary.
The first one I attended had to translate into English French texts of the eighteenth century and I was not prepared for what came next.
“Miss Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), “please translate the first paragraph.”
Not one of them.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake dough, knew well how to expel bad bile.
“Do Thatcherists refuse to learn French, or are they just fools?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning with the tears I was trying to contain.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt grunted.
I returned to my room like a soul in sorrow.
That night I sat alone at dinner time in college; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who applied as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said politely.
“I’m afraid that’s how it goes.
They mess with anyone suspected of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it'll be even worse.
Many Tories newcomers appear to be Labour.”
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to disguise.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs. Thatcher was saying.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated.”
Other students adopted this song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to hang out with people who thought like me only after dark?
Should I become Labour and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me presented themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined for my college.
They hated him for being not only from the Conservative Party, but also Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He detested the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he said.
I began to move daily from Oxford to my parents’ house in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded family and friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dreamy needles.
Even my communist friends have always had an impeccable attitude.”
His sore eyes began to blur.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would break if you left him.”
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had implied, quite seriously, that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had “brainwashed me” and called them “dumb old men.”
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch’s press.
My door was locked.
I was inside huddled in fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak weeping.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 Conservative Party prime ministers but is now hiding behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", an apotheosis retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "maison" over the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is "il Signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until next March 3, private letters and photos with the signature of the most pomegranate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from the humble couturier of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty is not bad.
“At least they don’t put out the butts of their hair on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved to be invited to their chalet in Gstaad,” explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
Argentinian model Valeria Mazza also doesn’t forget the fashion designer’s charisma.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to have dinner at his apartment.
There were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Every one of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
“It never goes out of style because its designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Alcurnia parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-required loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk of sixty meters long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the catwalk to contemplate a "audience" of dreams that wears masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding dresses and the ones that he used.
Names such as Sibylle of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophia of Habsburg shine in this audience of mannequins.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Designer, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trouser, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love of women, because he enhances our beauty,” she added.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and living in Italy, I dreamed of reaching the age and the opportunity to be able to wear one of his evening costumes...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flying skirt, draped "corsage" and word of honor neckline.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dresses from the couturier with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that comes with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding dress at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the couturier calls his seamstresses) to make that ivory-coloured silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace and a four-and-a-half-foot tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the haute couture of the late twentieth century, "the return of the clients of high society".
Obsessed for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accrues as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“I have always been struck by his refinement, his calm, his clean and perfect appearance,” D’Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The world’s toughest job: Kawah Ijen’s human mules
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano are risking their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living pulling sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas emanating from the Earth’s bowels solidifies when it comes into contact with air.
After pulling out large rocks of sulfur, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two baskets of bamboo that he carries on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
They are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend at the step of a turtle, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the precipice.
They know that any trip could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell down the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
Once upstairs, they make their way among the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, fatiguedly loading the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters above sea level.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for every kilogram of sulfur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As usual, it is to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily transports.
It takes three hours in each and ends up ground, but they allow you to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such an inhuman effort, it is three times as much as you would earn on the field.
"The miners' salary is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros), "says the porter, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut was not that hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing with his skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pass the bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
This is the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
“I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden hut with other porters, it rises every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not cease to flow at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends to the crater illuminating himself with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers carry the sulfur baskets over their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its dripping benefits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction to save costs or supply any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and at both weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera that, along with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for the beasts and not for the people,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old heavyweight carrier who has been on the Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, she says she will endure working "everything she can" because she needs the money to educate her three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and barks the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious illnesses... beyond, of course, their usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, knee pains and sores in the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the cestas.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions pull 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat road through the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the toughest trades in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and the cost of property and education for not having children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we create life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that — or perhaps because of that — the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (cake) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, harbors the hope that with the announcement they will manage to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill "their national duty."
This is something purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt this was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do as creatively as possible to solve this problem, which is composing a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn’t take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national division of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as the replenishment rate – was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy for the National Population Division, says it’s because of “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increased singleness, and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where xenophobia abounds, barely disguised, against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone on to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance for developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the center’s financial district doesn’t seem to have much effect.
“People are very stressed out, homes are expensive and so is education, so a lot of people are putting it off,” says one young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
The private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of private or "the scope of private life that you have the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child under 16?
How do you apply this definition in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by venting on the Internet situations that you surely wouldn’t share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on a personal level, and “in the user’s password and name,” when they applied it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets I wouldn’t upload to a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“They are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone,” she says.
On FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or of someone who’s making a fool of me,” he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just upload them,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” she says.
He did not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to anyone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14, is different.
The teen has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for his home address or phone number.
“If I was pressured or demanded to do so, I would just take them out of my account,” he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unaware of the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"It just gave him privacy."
It then explains a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I don't like it or I feel like it.
“Although I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of seeking information, but with the emergence of these sites the rules of the game changed," he says.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a master’s degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of Native and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the subject is complex, "because we are asking you to have a definite criterion on what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that".
“Also be selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is through questions that make them reflect.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t help,” he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to have a photo of yourself posted by a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you tag holiday photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do off line.
It's the same rules.
“Anyone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, just as it should be on social media,” he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents read the policies of social networks conscientiously.
By understanding each of the incisors they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR Summit ends without making the Lima Declaration public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending presidents.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency indicated at the beginning that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but then said that at some point it will be published on the Peruvian government’s website.
When consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
The access of journalists to the information of the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the silent video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the governments of Unasur attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the unrest of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is about Humala's pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure that transmission systems were insured for all journalists but limited the collection of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that resolves a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will act and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely erroneous.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence".
It reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-cost internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must serve to broaden our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural areas and borders ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for his re-entry into the Union of South American Nations," from which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations among neighbors, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in a respectful way the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“We will review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,” he said.
"With President Ortega, I look forward to being able to tell him that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met earlier to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, affirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He defended, in that sense, the project of establishing South American citizenship that is encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose pact on human rights.
Those who give the chair never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States,” he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret that decision because he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that, at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish court for demanding that he be subjected to interrogation on his territory for an alleged sex crime when “the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa said there is a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," he said.
What there is is the danger of deteriorating your physical and mental health by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“That complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safe-conduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent talks.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings in different European instances,” he said.
“If Britain gives the safe-conduct tomorrow, it’s over.”
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie, which distort the freedom of expression".
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians but the bad journalists on the basis of profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, he welcomed that these journalists are no longer "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and said that if he is re-elected "he will delve deep into the revolution to continue on the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d'état clad in legality" because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly pertinent" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this ruling is not being complied with.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed extensively to overcome them and move forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the litigation for maritime limits that Peru and Chile maintain in the same court and opined that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries undertake to accept judgment no matter how hard."
Referring to the eventuality that he will run as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 election, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as that of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
“My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
Winning would be my last term in the presidency and from there we leave public life.
If we lose the same.
“It’s a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It doesn’t mean a relapse in President Chavez’s state of health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today cause late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with the test result: AIDS positive.
"It was as if I dropped a bomb," he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to make "smoother," with no apparent success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness and began to inquire about it; with such endeavor that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), which he arrived at in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut".
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, “depleted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life depend on the degree of affect to the immune system that patients present at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years.
In simple words, the above means that those diagnosed with HIV at age 25, under these terms "as long as you remain in control can live without problems up to 75 years," explained the interviewee.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths as of May this year; however, it is assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
I don’t think the problem is access to treatment.
This is how I visualize it, this is how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medication the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, and what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, mass screening needs to be offered to all people who need it.
Its proposal includes specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a particular laboratory to be tested, only motivated because he had done it a friend and, despite his young age, he was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
“If I’m already going to die, I better burst three times a week,” they say no to me.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take the medications.
To date, her parents only know she had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person," Fabrizio said, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let the test be done, if they were at risk, let the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, let them learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the battle slogan for AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a cover journalist who has taken up the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "effectively the distribution of condoms has increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of one hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those who, today, still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with sorority and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which teenagers do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms are not only behind the counters and those one hundred are in dispatchers of public toilets of the places frequented by young people.
It’s not about promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the chelating and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez responded, when asked if there would be condom distribution in his Administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual pathway, 6% to the blood pathway and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court a ruling that does not know the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt achieved via a mercantile contest in Mexico, the scenario sets a nefarious precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the procedures endorsing the survival of the firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical field, the backing of the June 15 sentence issued by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the northern district of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of foreclosure of their properties in allende el Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door to Mexico’s leading glassmaker to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
At first, while the judge in the case notes that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Appeals Court says that the main proceeding is the contest processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created, with the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the mercantile competition the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro’s was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro that fought against it in the Courts of the United States, that is to say the "vulture" funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
This fact is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced since 2008 in the wake of the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, hitting the country.
For the time being, the firm of the González Sada family will file a reconsideration appeal before the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the plenary of the latter, that is, the five magistrates, given that only three voted.
If this does not succeed, the appeal of Cerciorare that requires the review of the process by a higher body, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States, will be claimed.
The seriousness of the case is that the court bypassed a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competitions Law, noting that it was cleared with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to tie this with chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Law.
Moreover, it was noted that the country had adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General Balance
For several months, the complaints placed on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Union of Aviation Pilots has already found the bottleneck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission who is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General’s Office on an operation carried out by the employer to extract from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been funneled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Searching for the Dragon Mart
Meeting at a forum at the University of the Caribbean over the weekend, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal center of sale and distribution facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products of the country of the wall, with a housing zone at the foot for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental thing that razed with part of protected areas and poses the mother of all the hiding places against the industry.
Acta is Dead
The government ignored a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances Mexico’s ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already gone to the archive.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Basketball globetrotters Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of hockey and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as broad a mental collection of local basketball history as does Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was a player of minor categories, player of the National Superior Basketball, proxy and leader in the BSN with the Cowboys of Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I’ve worn a lot of hats on basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 90s,” Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive trajectory, attest to this.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, the ones he treasures with the most emotion are those that reminisce about his time with the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old serving as co-empowerment or empowerment of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as an agent, co-agent or manager.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy made his debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had led here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a very strong player, 6"7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best snipers.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another one.
The championship of the Cowboys with Gausse enjoyed it, but already in the distance, because by 1988 he was already a federative leader.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his and Mincy’s executives on the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the Pre-Olympic Games in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we reached fourth place and it should have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a peel to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won us the bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-playing players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a juvenile Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the mess of the Pan American of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculin did.
And that without counting his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Boricua leader?
That's very hard.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider to be your greatest achievement in the federation?
To have been part of the National Team's most glorious era between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now, children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predator oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producer of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the iconic role he loved most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when she passed away at a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him so much.
“He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his house.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful performance of the charmingly detestable J.R. that brought Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars in bookmakers.
It also helped give the series an audience record at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment show in history, behind the ending of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left the city, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as a corrupt insatiable with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be interned.
“I know what I want in J.R.’s gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
Five of the episodes for the second season had already been completed and a sixth was in the process, the network reported.
Immediately there was no pronouncement from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on stage in New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything in there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a little while, but you'll be fine."
She was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the “long countdown” of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, which many people have clung to as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called “deudarmagedon” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we are 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World.”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyzed why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
“I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to deliver a course, titled only “The End of the World.”
“We didn’t add ‘2012’ to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin,” students must study, generate projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work “until the very night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“It was saturated in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received email messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old graduate student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
The apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a teacher — said they believed in the December 21 expiration date.
“Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and in a way discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple and West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
“In other places people don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end-of-the-world" parties.
“Maybe I’ll call some friends to have us laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
