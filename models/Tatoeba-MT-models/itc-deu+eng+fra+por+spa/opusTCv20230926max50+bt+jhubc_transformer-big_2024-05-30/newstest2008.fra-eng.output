Inflation in Europe has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 countries of the euro area was higher than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, the European Community statistics office located in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the interest rate by saying that lowering interest rates, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is the Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter" inflation so as not to have to intervene on this subject at a later date.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 per cent is a record over the last twelve years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Grain futures market shares rose 88 percent and the price of soybeans also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world’s oil price rose 52 percent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, over the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the policy rate twice in 2008.
Gallup warns of government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Young Democrats Alliance) increased significantly at the beginning of December, with the largest number of supporters since 2002, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never seen such low socialist support, at 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
On the faithful voters certain to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous low point, the proportion of those who considered that the economic situation in the country was particularly serious has never been so high, it amounts to 41 percent and according to 46 percent complementary the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects an aggravation and only a tenth expects an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of those polled, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, said the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
Thirteen percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society that believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change in government.
While after last October's riots, 35 percent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, at present this rate is only 20 percent, and the relative majority (33 percent) believe that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the respondents said they would certainly vote, and the additional 20 per cent said they would probably vote.
To make a comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of those polled would certainly participate and 15 percent would probably participate.
74 percent of people would say no to higher education tuition fees, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 percent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters respectively would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay fees.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
The hypermarkets located in the Budaörs commercial triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year, with the difference that this year the VAT rate did not rise.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, a value increase of well over a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, which had “already soared” at grocery stores last December, have no longer risen sharply from the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded by at least 91 forints the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but prices for turkey fillet, nuts and poppy rose sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found from one kilo at only 139 forints.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the delivered bottle of two liters of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the delivered bottle included.
However, this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of her Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 and 18 percent, respectively.
Comparing last year’s most expensive basket and this year’s cheapest basket, we find a 12 percent difference while the difference between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forints, although the impact of the VAT rate increase was already noticeable in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has puzzled the trade, the hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply on products because they were unable to predict the impact of the change in prices on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the Daily Basket prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the value of the 2006 basket, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and the prices of the cheapest increased by 1,284 forints as well.
Approaching the two Christmas seasons, we have seen a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer items have increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some staple feeds, the Statistical Institute found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the evidence, the flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers because they have managed to make the brutal price increases accepted also by the multinationals.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the food of long conservation by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed at the cash registers of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to the survey companies of not even reaching the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer items.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overwork of medical staff do not help block infections, says the chief doctor of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected on a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured person from a serious car accident was released from the hospital but had to return shortly after due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to perform a major operation because of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multidrug-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician at the National Center for Epidemiology.
That is to say, it is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well-antibiotic-resistant bacterium that will rapidly proliferate in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacteria can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, on elderly patients, those with small weights or those with a weakened organism.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
Especially not to confuse the infection with the epidemic, we do not find MRSA only there or we do not look for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the caregivers put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics tailored to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, however the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favorable to prevent the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and in nursing homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and isolate MRSA patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these reviews.
Most cases only see the light of day if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines also for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be performed to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient care and in basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferates from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and wear protective masks. However, there are significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area as well.
MRSA proliferates through infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient can not always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other while in terms of epidemic, the patients should be away from each other by at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, save on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government Project Against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA represents an exorbitant expense for the social security funds, which is why the fight against this infection is everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to the published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, who was the author of a fatal accident, was not intoxicated.
The official statement regarding the fatal accident caused by the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been drawn up.
It can be ruled out that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has resigned from his post since, who crushed a pedestrian causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, said Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital after the relative finding was made.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which has already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
Last Tuesday, the former head of the police station in the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself facing him when he turned, with his personal car, in Kossuth Lajos street in the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(In fact, crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Code, a car that starts a turn must let pedestrians through.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and he applied for retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident greatly upset him.
The investigation into this case is being carried out by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
An additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed on Friday in Budapest three agreements worth a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, of which a credit agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The agreement on the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million credit also concerns the budgetary financing of projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary, with the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million to be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place in the framework of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project of metro line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible modification of the initial contract once Hungary has finalised the details of the financing of the subway with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment commission.
Bulgaria, a paradise for the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market which is always the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most fashionable target in Eastern Europe with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albéna, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nessebar but they are more and more looking for a building in the area of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also more and more to buy in the very inexpensive corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, retail and office spaces promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are looking at the same time to change their lives, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the shores of the Black Sea and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria has been cited among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of realizing a medium or long-term added value.
The price of real estate in the capital is constantly rising as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially outweighs the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Six Percent Hungarian
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is expected to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, vigorous discussions are being held between developing and developed countries on this issue.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not want to discuss exact figures, while it was ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committing, excluding emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board, likely under the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), said Piac es Profit (Market and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor confirms the EU's ambition to retain its role as flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from the level reached in 1990 by 2020, regardless of the success of the signing of the “post-2012 agreement”, and is ready to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries are also ready to make commitments tailored to their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol countries had aimed at a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time made the commitment by 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments of reduction below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international body of scientific emission reductions, whose need was emphasized in the international IPCC report.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase of the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British military recruits on YouTube
British army units are communicating, on the video-sharing site, recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of becoming popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that became passionate about YouTube: the special units intervening in Afghanistan uploaded video footage of the operations carried out against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or uploaded by compatriots over the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net by this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and is communicating videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were passed on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defense, they were also used to make known to the general public the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
Propaganda published in this way costs practically nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, said Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies in a special form the merits of military operations decided by the government.
The Americans played a game.
The army is annoyed because, apart from carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have been passed on the sharing site that also show, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already gone on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on a real mission, but the British army is only recently eager to upload these videos.
The Americans recruit a little differently using the free-to-play shooter America's Army, in which the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and doughnuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by having doughnuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, yet another will delight officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas vibe.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so enjoy the power.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defense but it is not the employees of the ministry who will be invited.
At Christmas, orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also be held.
The department plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred wholesale employees, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost a million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party which is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, company managing the tenders.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté has been rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to reach the person in charge.
Costume is not compulsory
The ILO building was not only home to the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of a Christmas party organized a ball for St. Luke's Day on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
This ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister’s words of welcome and dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to [origo]'s question: Evening dress was not mandatory at this ball at all.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Communities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and party for its employees, inside its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not invite her collaborators officially to a Christmas party but to a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and eat donuts, the press service said, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his staff to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas party in its large hall at which 436 employees are expected.
It expects to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the presentation of the minister but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, Christmas will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located at City Wood, and according to the communication of the ministry, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the one hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services have informed [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Decorative Art.
Mega Strike Forces Gather
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will constitute, on Friday, their strike commission, which will be responsible for coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health insurance, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major traffic jams because rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 13h.
The unions of the league will announce, Friday afternoon, the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protesters will be held and, starting Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Funds Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide what to do next.
According to the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is likely that the vote on the Health Funds Act will not take place until late in the evening, or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic jams are planned: the railways will stop work indefinitely and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report an indefinite strike, others have declared a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon the M<0xC3><0x81>V (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) were unable to reach an agreement on minimum services, but, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest public transport will strike from the start of service until 13h, Budapest airport between 7h and 9h in the morning, the Industrial Electricity and Thermal Energy Unions of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union called for a strike for 8 hours and 2 hours respectively during 2 hours.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country alternately, the Union of Health and Social Sector Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating retirement to be put in place from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third demand is for a guarantee of retirement before the legal age, which would allow for the transfer into the system of the functions that deserve it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increases, in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the company points out that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes may occur as a result of the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: “Public actors passed the public debate on the Roma affair to representatives of radical and extreme political groups that based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians”.
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened, and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular with regard to confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following a greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups since the fall of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 calling themselves the "national self-defense association".
“The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their adherents for defense missions (disaster, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary, in addition, evoking the incapacity of the police, of the army, in other words, of the state,” they added.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method that, based on the resentment of the political society and the parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions from a civilian point of view.
The emphasis on civil character and association status therefore serves only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering these associations in court but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk compared to neighboring relationships.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultranationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This affects the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous Roma riots that broke out in a Sofia neighborhood (Kraszna Poljana) led to the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to set up a guard, saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the gypsies have “terrorized” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the constitution of their own guard as resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not preclude Hungarian Roma from reacting to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, Political Capital’s risk warning reads.
At the request of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could impact the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become commonplace to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian law distinguishes between national and state holidays and rest days.
Days of rest are often related to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year ending and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that New Year's Eve can rest quietly.
Moreover, in a year, we have a total of eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, as is October 23, which is the commemorative day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1 is Labor Day and on November 1 and 2, we remember members of our family and friends who have died.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely falling on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has made specific regulations on the replacement days of the days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and all their employees, civil servants and people working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions that are constantly rotating and in service, by their vocation, and also to days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because according to experiences the majority of people do rather overtime or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home for four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25 will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for October 23: Saturday, October 18 will be a working day replacing Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can annoy colleagues terribly
Emails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that “embellish” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that we called you from the marketing department,” a colleague tells you.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to make things right by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the less common solution).
In most cases, this is arranged with an apology.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you will be able to cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There’s nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you don’t find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they are right to be angry with you for stealing their property.
Don’t bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there are no more and you need them right away.
Are you talking about the privacy of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop gossip spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (suppositions) about the privacy of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information inside yourself and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you saying you're sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself ill under the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or feel you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your missions in the future must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't get your colleagues in trouble!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work or that something may happen that would force you to stay home, do not forget to warn your boss and your colleagues to prevent them from being surprised at your absence the next day.
Flirting, laughing, phone
Do you get into your work but the laughter of your colleagues tears you away brutally?
Did you unwittingly become a witness to a phone conversation that you would have been better off not listening to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with hums, chants, loud arguments (which you conduct over their heads), poundings, big words, or loud discontent.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing others of wrongdoing?
If your work is not done by the deadline, you forget to send a mail or an important message, do not accuse anyone for this forgetfulness!
Do not put it on account of the possible chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has presented inconveniences for others, repair the mistake!
Ask how you can fix your fault, fix the negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Putting on a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you are no longer interesting
Slowly move forward in the usual morning plug.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm making the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of the hour, then a female choir joins it as a real jewel.
Mr2 airs the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
But now it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall image and, despite the new fashion of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in Yonderboi's band before he started on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to be known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The line-up initially playing in small clubs was beginning to be known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 as one of the 50 most important records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble have become undeniably “trendy” but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted well, they released a new and better record.
The album titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new avenues for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuation with the years spent at Pécs.
It was a line from Balázs Zságer's former Pécs group.
We are well there with the reference to flight but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the guitar stronger, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the premiere of the album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real tube for the radio, Mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is fine (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me to ask a question: has your music remained a music targeting a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music for a certain layer doesn’t tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can be sincere, too.
The reception attitude works in this spirit also regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young people in their tens or twentys but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have occurred in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the public’s role in your work?
Are you interested in who or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I’m obviously glad to see that more and more people come to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important at the concerts or the mutual influence already works but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the audience, you would no longer be interesting.
hvg.hu: Do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and has a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some people try to find traces in our music.
Rather, we are team players who have confidence in each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
In the beginning, it was of course inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his band and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the list of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you have consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t plan to make a tube so we could sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This song existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The string of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same melody that the girls later learned.
I got it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me back then but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There’s no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don’t have a role alone, they all sing together and they don’t sing louder than the music, so the music doesn’t just accompany their singing.
They were behind the scenes too.
Is it meant?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due solely to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song made you work the hardest?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the music creation process, we had more difficult pieces during the mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, it all set up like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What’s your favorite part of the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I’ve already “released” this record.
These include Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous trader has risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A cover-up fraudster.
This is the name of his former employee, the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komer<0xC4><0x8D>ní banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of him.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he acknowledged in time the crisis of the American mortgage market.
“He is fragile,” his superiors implied, who reported him to the police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel’s testimony reported by French media, including Le Monde, the man’s transactions produced at the end of last year a profit amounting to 1.6 billion euros.
The Crisis Overtakes the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income clients or those who had encountered repayment difficulties in the past, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel said, adding that he had, of course, kept nothing for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed to having falsified the reports so as not to be traced.
He managed to deceive his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to take an interest in his trades.
Who does not risk anything has nothing
Was he afraid to be discovered?
Preferably not.
“I thought the mere fact of getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.”
Where does his willingness to take such a big risk come from?
He came to his position only gradually.
He started working at Societe Generale in 2000, just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never earn as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was far less respected than the others.
In terms of my academic background and my professional and personal background, "said Kerviel to the investigators.
However, shortly after taking office, he achieved his first major success.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone
“It was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
This is when the coup of the beginning of the year comes.
They lose a billion dollars in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announces that it has lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became suspicious because of his vacation.
“Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to someone else,” Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (around CZK 365 billion) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly SEK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit the most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will be the source of an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage next year a sum of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, must be used to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new, more efficient management methods.
Until now, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members.
Court upholds 20-year prison sentence for former Nicaraguan president
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for former president Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of that Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or he will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
They were fictitious corporations and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and closest supporters.
Some of this money went to the funds that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted
That's the way it is.
The state budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who prepared it and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford its refusal.
Unlike the hectic debate before the vote on the declaration of distrust of the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has passed this law without any problems, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Like it or not, each chapter and article constitutes the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive mediatically and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
The arguments of politicians are of much more interest to the opinion than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three ills that the current budget is not able to solve at the same time:
The first is the significant share of the costs of mandates imposed by law, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and communes.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued, stunned, bonds, over-indebted their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In past years, they managed to repay these debts through the mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, especially those of the energy, obtained from the State in the context of the privatizations.
They no longer have that source.
If only official and verifiable facts are used, it can be seen that:
Our economy has been going through a phase of growth for several years now, just like the rest of the world, and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD does not fail to do so.
This was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
This is a monstrous disgrace that essentially falls on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, globally, are least at risk of poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes which have, in recent years, unfortunately become unnecessarily inflated.
Although some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, has been suppressed, if a delay in the retirement age limit, as well as a reform of the pension system, does not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever will be in power will only administer.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the taxed money between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary expenses to be deferred by mandate expenses.
The $70 billion deficit projected for 2008 would be utterly useless if previous governments hadn’t dissipated all the money they could.
If we really don't want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can spend only the equivalent of what it can take in taxes and tax duties, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be placed on the money markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will auction $40 billion and provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of September 11 that the Central Banks of individual States have decided on such concerted action, aimed at preventing or even diminishing the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in his report to clients.
"Cooperative action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl said in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, mostly in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in billions.
“If central banks have chosen this approach, it is because they really need to understand what can still follow,” says ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he adds.
Central banks fear that while banks themselves will have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would lower consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect economic growth around the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after failing to lower London's interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still fearful of mutual borrowing, despite the U.S., Canadian and British central banks having repeatedly lowered interest rates during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Tempus Consulting's Greg Salvaggio told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the approach of the central banks will not help to ward off the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
President Klaus: Ecologists’ debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be especially damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism this time fell on the international conference of the United Nations on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, Not Green, he stated that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President underlined in the presentation of his book that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
Now interested persons can read his positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless has, in his opinion, enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academic capable of following and appreciating scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly evolving, the changes in it are therefore normal, there is not a shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they therefore do not represent any danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence the ineffectual, unnecessary climate change.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integralist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have not been able to renew their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
This is the last day people can still apply for renewal, so the authorities are in a position to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid driver's license will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving license especially those who no longer wish to drive.
As municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are flooded with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has been increasing this week.
The City Council serves approximately 2,000 customers per day.
There's a queue of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140,000 drivers have not yet renewed their driver's licenses.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for issuance within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who fail to complete the mandatory renewal of the driver's license by the end of the year and travel on the road without a valid license will face a fine as of January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence through an amicable approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
In doing so she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to exercise restraint and impose fines not exceeding 1000 kroner.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in the tens of thousands.
The driver's license is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether or not they want to have it.
It is not as with the identity card that, in turn, must be valid without exceptions.
Those who no longer wish to drive should issue their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Individuals with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driver’s licenses issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the sentences of detectives agreed with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, former police officers accused of collusion with David Berdych’s gang, will serve 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The High Court of Prague thus sentenced them definitively by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Originally, the Department for the Fight against Organized Crime's detectives were facing sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently awaiting only the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already been sentenced to more than 16 years in prison in other trials.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court convicted 19 people of participation in robberies, and the High Court today dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants questioned the prosecution from the outset by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement among others with Berdych, passed on information from police sources to criminals, covered various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang paid back 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík.
The prosecution refers to the gang's criminal activity from 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robberies whose victims have, in most cases, suffered serious harm to health, but also the abuse of power of a public official and prohibited armaments.
During the house searches, the police discovered pistols illegally detained, shells with a steel core, a sight for direct laser fire or a machine gun.
According to the allegations, the gang was enriched by tens of millions of crowns.
Aside from nearly 20 men in the trial, the courts have already convicted Berdych and a host of others of other robberies.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing avoided, for the time being, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are currently detained in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
Igor Veleba, a lawyer for the families, wants to obtain compensation from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> for 12 million crowns plus costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál disagrees at all with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, it is very, very high," Dostál said after the hearing.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report whose drafting the opposing party has commissioned.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
The amount should, according to him, be set between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov's family demanded one million crowns for every month they could not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, drafted for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stressful situation was better withstood by the men, although they were faced with remorse for not being able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening precisely at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermák in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
The governor of the region Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il gave at the end of October to each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of expenses caused by the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to have liability insurance.
In case of non-compliance, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for help from the manager.
Until now, the courts recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables were of the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Království (the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské království (Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it was indeed he who used for the first time the title King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitizing over the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
“There is a work of almost ten years behind us.
Searching for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, it is the money that is the cause of the litigation.
“After years, they have realized that the project is successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title vala<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> král (King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> crowned him king in 1993.
But at the time, it had nothing to do with the project of setting up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of making Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Království passports appear.
From a humorous action originated a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, of the company Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature be quoted in the passport and he even proposed to the holders balances on the price of the visit of his farm and his theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the nude idea, published by Polívka in the show mane<0xC5><0xBE>, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské království project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was formed by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves intensely to the project.
Collaboration between the now-enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to build up between Polívka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, inspired by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, assumed by the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court today dismissed.
What could make the case clear is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half of the princess.
There should be a new king.
He did not want to betray the details and the date.
“We don’t want to go fast.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I have never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the change of gear, the handling and also that of the manufacture could, in many respects, be described as inferior to the average.
However, currently there is on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which, it, is clearly better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes a step further, I just have to think better.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I was complaining, for example, about headspace on the back seats.
While that ends the complaints because the body combi means that even the great devils will be, in this regard, comfortable.
Let's see what's done.
I'm going to talk about the inside very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so stylish.
The seats are comfortable and the days when one could complain about too short seats or backrests are over.
The side guidance has also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the body is also noticeable here.
The combi also sees disappear the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A chest in the chest
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this one as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel ice) and a rather easy stowage.
The blind spaces are equipped with stopping elastics which are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold fairly heavy objects.
But let’s stop at the volume.
This makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is compared to the competition a rather average figure.
Except for the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in its class in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, we see that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to taking holidays abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the body remaining after the reverse of the backrests of the rear seats perfectly straight, or a very low step.
120 horsepower spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is what a 1.6 should look like that powers a family hatchback.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by <0xC5><0xA0>koda that often gives the impression of having an exhaust jar blocked by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for everyone.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1.4-liter Otto engine amounting to 329,900 K<0xC4><0x8D> is still passable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
In addition to head airbags, we have automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs at the end of the day 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
That's a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to the price of the Fabia and you'll get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools goes wrong
The number of children from Eastern Europe in UK schools is increasing, raising concerns among the remaining children about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently faced with a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of Northern Kent, where conflicts between remaining and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to intensify, is a good example of the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The quarrels, the chicane and the fights between the students have transposed into the relations between the parents.
The situation went so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted her with racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene in the aftermath of the attack on a Slovak migrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly addressed the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
“When we were coming home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," another unpleasant adventure described a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remnants went so far as to describe conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above testify that the atmosphere in British schools between the original inhabitants and the immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can be achieved if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
Now, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the stronghold of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and transshipment place of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the US (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings were pushed and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50s of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your own autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita de la Habana.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats once imported have already long ago, in a climate so salty and moist, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is substantially decrepit, nowhere else in the surroundings are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if needed, its development has the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane had returned from the extended plantations in the sugar mills on a narrow lane by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how we can see small locomotives running, contemporary ones are only in museums.
Where to direct your steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
There is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Not to mention that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that the one who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows on limestone soil.
Mogotes, limestone balloons, and rocks rise from the bottom of the valley, and fertile earth being trapped in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is probably where Cuban tobacco of the highest quality is grown.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Perhaps someone will also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed.
Trinidad
Ancient town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth has been embodied in the beauty and character of this small town.
Coloniální <0xC5><0xA1>pan<0xC4><0x9B>lská architecture, v<0xC3><0xBD>razn<0xC4><0x9B> ovlivn<0xC4><0x9B>ná pozd<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC5><0xA1>ími francouzsk<0xC3><0xBD>mi osadníky, is za <0xC4><0x8D>ty<0xC5><0x99>i staletí tém<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> nezm<0xC4><0x9B>nila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountainous massif Escambray, is a place so far apart that even in the 50' of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the sidelines.
We didn’t build anything, and that’s why we didn’t demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their heads.
If you have more time than an afternoon in Trinidad, then it is also worth visiting interesting places in the surrounding area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which comes alive after sunset and where the music only deafens in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this town located in the extreme east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads there.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost unmarked by human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the Eastern Reef of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where the old stronghold and the current El Castillo hotel stands, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sows and the Isla de Pinos island, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of former slaves, about all this one could fill a lot of pages.
As they say, it’s best to see it once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say Americans
The lack of troops and necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Minister Robert Gates said NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not proceeding as it should, agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
Alongside the growing challenge from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and allied coordination.
While the U.S. has called this week through Defense Minister Robert Gates for NATO troops to step up activity, Britain sees strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and intensifying development aid as a priority.
“The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow residents to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The Afghan insurgent activity is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, up to 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit both in the organization and in the equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the period ahead, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Conflicts over the issue have also reigned in recent months between the countries involved if all allies are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting demands they are subjected to are not as rigorous as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Lazy Afghans discovered: Germans play while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on to counterattack by publishing a photo of a British troop during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to 1 trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding Kroner 84,000 is on each Czech.
Total debt rose at the end of September to Kronor 842.7 billion.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
Thanks to a better-than-expected evolution of the state budget savings, the department reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion kroner.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
During the nine months of this year, therefore, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the state debt dating back to the beginning of October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns rests with each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has indebted more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could cross the border of one trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor’s forecast is similar: “One could exceed the trillion in the course of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be pushed back to 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Debts are growing
The debt of the state is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is generated essentially by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
State debt is financed by treasury bonds, annuity securities, direct loans or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt has so far increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
The foreign debt of the state has increased this year at the moment from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The state debt called negotiable reached at the end of September 803.3 billion kroner and as of June it decreased by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average state debt maturity was 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased year-on-year from the first to the third half by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a figure far too high.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by annuity securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It’s bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be matter to negotiate when pension reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than we expected
It follows the government's debt financing and management strategy for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected evolution of the savings of the state budget, the ministry reduced the amount expected to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is essentially constituted by the deficit of the state budget which will obviously reach 76 billion kroner this year, instead of the 91.3 billion kroner originally planned.
Secondly, the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency are Kroner 13.3 billion, the reserve of Kroner 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state annuity securities for Kroner 43 billion and the repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to Kroner 1.8 billion.
She was appearing today in a court in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and to deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of having allowed pupils aged 6 to 7 to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punished with whipping.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher, who works at Khartoum’s Unity High School in Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with assaulting Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to the month of September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7 years, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
“Eight names are coming out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the classroom, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that would be insulting to a religious faith, “I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name,” he said.
Opinion shared by many students of the teacher who describe her as "very caring towards her students" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most widely given first name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, concluded a sixth and final session of talks without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
“It is unfortunate that the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the status,” European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger told a news conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region was “at stake,” his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"There is no immediate expectation of violence, but we are entering a very difficult period," he said, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiating session since the troika was tasked with new mediation by the UN in August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence to Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Kharchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement was reached," Kosovo's autonomous authority president Fatmir Sejdiu said in the hotel in Baden where the "last chance negotiations" had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.”
“Domino Effect”
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said it feared a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
“For Serbia,” he said, “this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word.
“Only a solution in the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status,” adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made “in consultation” with the West.
Bush breaks agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland on Tuesday that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations to find a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the “roadmap” for peace they agreed in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim “to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues.”
This name covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and thorough" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others".
Olmert, in turn, pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the deadline for the implementation of his “two-state vision” of Palestinian and Israeli co-existing at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had secured a commitment in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in his interview with the Saudi-owned Arabic-speaking daily.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of miscellaneous fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspection générale de la police nationale (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She was not on duty but on patrol, and was moving at 40-50 km/h, without a gyro headlamp,” a police source said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, “not approved, therefore not allowed to circulate on public roads” (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated “at very fast pace”.
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority on the right," a police officer said.
Alcohol control of the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (before crushed, windshield starred, bumper torn) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "facts of involuntary homicide and non-assistance to a person in danger" to the IGPN, a matter with the departmental direction of public security of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stage, excluded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the policemen, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the wedges on the floor, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled as long as the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police had very quickly left the scene, thus not providing help to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "any serious misconduct" on this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which you have to be very careful," a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness from those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows overlooking the scene.
"We immediately went downstairs, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them," the witness said.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely haggard policeman, who was limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that those present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, the rescue arrived “about twenty minutes after the police had left”.
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
“I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived right away.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tensions Rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday cracked down on the first protests since Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
They responded by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other protests reportedly took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday garnered the support of religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "urged the population to send flowers to the judges who ruled against the state of emergency and garbage to those who swore an oath before Musharraf".
Musharraf's promise is no longer true.
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is directly affected by the emergency measure proclaimed Saturday night.
She was to rule in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential election, on October 6, by indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to leave the army and become a civilian president “no longer holds” after the state of emergency was instituted, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf was put under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies are unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, the Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception has allowed a better "control of fertility", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Or calculated by the month for one in five couples and if possible in the spring, the season considered the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) to complete the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential for the station’s continued scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records due to its duration, its remoteness from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "bricolated" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday as astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a large cylindrical part soon to host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of docking dock for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a module of electricity generation by solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to post it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the module's solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And this is where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged for nearly a meter by a cable that got stuck.
Deployment has been halted so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who originally had to make a check-out of the Discovery shuttle and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go snail at the end of the 30 meters of length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very clever, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor was therefore tasked with "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After accurately inspecting the damage, he severed the faulty cable and installed some sort of "attelle" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the airlock and, from the inside, by the other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey rod wrapped in insulation to prevent electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricolated" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his tools and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts were enjoying a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
EADS Securities Sanctioned on the Stock Exchange
EADS shares are currently falling sharply on the Paris stock exchange, after the aerospace and defence group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS is currently losing 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its operating result forecast for 2007 following delays caused by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditioned the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to offset the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, including more than 1 billion for Airbus", the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income (EBIT) targets for 2007 when it presents its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operating result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges related to delays of another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the exit of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending voters a televised message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the head of the list of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is expected to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president let nothing of it shine through by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, elections without a hitch,” he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the point.
It denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziuganov said there had “never been such a dirty election, even in Yeltsin’s time.”
After the repression of protests last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains banned from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovietus"
Behind these unsuspended legislative elections stand two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Vladimir Putin, who was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
Either way, in the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel master of their destiny,” says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Koposov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: civil society has lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic ease,” said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "willfully renounce the personal responsibility" that they had briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
“What’s the point of thinking?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of United Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
People prefer stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for extremists either.
Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor, concludes: “What’s the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in open access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored over 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were hitherto available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is to say individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his successors.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States being completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research “in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers,” explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, a number of States, including Germany, had opposed the opening to the public of these names, owing to the sensitivity of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported civilians or those subjected to compulsory labor and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
EU and India to reach free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said.
In April, the EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to start negotiations on free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the EU, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact would greatly boost both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European commissioner said. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, head of the European Union's head of state.

Bank of England acknowledges concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was keen to ease the current backlash over credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion bid at a base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve inflow during the maintenance period beginning on December 6," it said in a statement.
The bank says that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time the BoE has put five-week cash on the market in an open market operation.
These are normally done within a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain interbank lending rates" on a day-to-day basis in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6 percent, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were accompanied by a high penalty rate that had deterred banks from using them.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC reject consideration of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national bureau of the PS, among which the increase of 50% of the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport check or the supervision of rents.
UMP and NC having voted against the consideration of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was adjourned after the general discussion that gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between majority and opposition a few hours after the televised intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill discussed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is coming up
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival by C3 Presents in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announced the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it is an honor to work with someone who has, no more and no less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is scheduled to take place August 8-10 on a private 500-acre farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which annually attracts some 80,000 people.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006 Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as our marketplace and were working diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” Jones said.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
“Unfortunately, we’ve gotten stuck in politics because of the current administration,” continues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we’ve been able to chat with Melvin Benn and we’re about to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8 million and $11.3 million respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours is held in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a country festival in the European way and an urban one in the American way.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "they are interesting enough to make it possible to invest in such an event and host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival's capacity is "very large," much like the 80,000-strong Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of the press release.
“Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, in the hopes of attracting all sorts of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract the Hollywood movie sets to Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes it...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A warrant - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions."
Is it difficult to play in the paws of the “Governor”?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge to be the best,” he said.
The race to the festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of local cinema.
The race for the Oscars has begun.
It will be from all the festivals on the West Side, be it Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present the Quebec films, highlight them and ensure that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a nice showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is headlining in Santa Monica and will be screened at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in hopes of the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year the experts are not so sure that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market generally behaves positively.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts exclusively based on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties await the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market feeds on the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight to quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not free of volatilities "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely drop in Fed rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say there will be a rally.
“It’s not the best thing,” the expert said.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock market index, has fallen nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the Constitution Day bridge (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound in the index that could be caused according to the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex to new peaks.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year the big values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and a few manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco said the increase will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
Builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they get into it.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," he said.
Cyclic consumption will be a protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do it very well too, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
In the last seven years, only on two occasions, December has been a bearish month.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, when stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the breaking of the technology bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December registered an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (at the moment the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in computer on its end-of-year rally.
Banque Populaire to open 200 offices from Monday to Saturday
Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Populaire Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open on Saturday from 10 am to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to reach an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of Banque Populaire will be decisive for other organizations to join or not this initiative that coincides with business hours.
This is precisely the objective that the People’s Bank is pursuing.
Attracting self-employed customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in the SMEs and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new branches but a renovation of existing ones.
For this, the organization will modernize the branches that it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The bank’s sales manager, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, said the renovation did not involve large investments, but rather hiring staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets in Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and apparently successful, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide hours, which are open even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've made it.
With this phrase, Paolo Vasile, a CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the channel he runs was doubling the value of its rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect tarnished his joy: 'what hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less,' he said.
However, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we fell less'.
Telecinco ended the day with an increase of 2.54%.
This gain stabilized its loss at 15.66% for a year.
The market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which sold 1.52% yesterday and has accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other publicly traded communications companies amounted to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable, 2,518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the fact that 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to surpass the 1,000 million gross advertising revenue, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
For this announced data to be real, the television channel would have to record a 3.6% increase in its advertising turnover for the current fiscal year compared to 965.4 million for the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, Antenna 3's net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to 734.4 million), while net television revenue increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the Stock Exchange is the significant pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company presided over by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official compromise to give at least 50%, although we have always said a lot more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given shares with Endemol’s 33%.”
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its earnings estimates for Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decrease in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company lowered Antenna 3's earnings forecast to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of MIFID, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress of amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies so that markets function effectively.
The MIFID, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of financial markets, at a time when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial advisory services for specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial advisory services (ESIS), financial advisory firms (FIAs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add to the regulated secondary markets the multilateral trading systems and the systems of internationalization of orders, which compete with the current managers of exchanges.
The Act also obliges investment firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and it obliges them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
Through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, including one that highlights that securitized debt will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of U.S. high-risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took advantage of to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after in 1977, was approved the Royal Decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increased by five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which was later used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data that will be revealed on 14 December next.
“The CPI will continue at relatively high levels.”
The second vice-president and economy minister, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes made clear in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential on monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were expecting a figure around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42,000 million from Northern Rock over three years
Northern Rock’s deposits have dropped by more than 50 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million since it entered a crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time he was amassing some record deposits above <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a figure that gradually fell in two and a half months because of the suspicion of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial trade mark Virgin Money, needs to seize about a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get those <0xC2><0xA3>18,000 million remaining until it reaches the 30,000 million goal.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its screaming advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin association, in which three other companies participate, including its favorite to save it from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana has been arrested for a plot of alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
In addition, one of the city council secretaries and the police chief of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May's self Juan Morales, current deputy of the right, and until then city councillor of the city, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the "leader" of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Planning Council and the possibility of new stops is not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As indicated yesterday by the Chaîne SER to the lawyer of the deputy 'of the popular party' Juan Morales, he was arrested when leaving the home of Morales with important documentation in his possession related to the plot.
In addition, according to the sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
There are currently eight people detained.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's bid for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win elections
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced by the organising secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal headquarters of that party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of the Congress, which on November 15 made public its decision not to run in the next general elections and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has continued to insist that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or scream" and make "it look more and more like citizens".
“Sometimes it seems regrettably that the only place in Madrid where we cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times.”
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to act as if he was already occupying his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider "domination".
Climate Propaganda
Given that the climate change movement is subjecting both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles to merciless persecution, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed in a decisive way to Spain being at the head of the European Union in the non-execution of the Kyoto protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in what sectors it has occurred and why his Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences this will have.
That is, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to corporate and individual accounts.
Up to one-hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed readerically so dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have impact, committees, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is only limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and that it does not pretend that we move by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Hall and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, informed today the sources of the investigation.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where at this time many agents met, who also presented themselves to the City Councillor's Office of Urban Planning and to the municipal company of management of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three stops are in addition to the six stops made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the redevelopment of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 dwellings, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Tribunal No. 1 of Totana investigates.
The first six detainees went to court today.
According to sources, the former city councillor of Totana and currently autonomous MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the target of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former city councillor, who lives in Murcia.
The director and the owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the bribes were allegedly carried out.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a poultry business well known in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that have been requalified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages Vigo car parks in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us yesterday’s commentary in Finland’s most important newspaper (certainly at the top of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that it appeared there, curiously, the review of Blackburn’s book:
"The content of the Philosophy course appealed to public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Educational Adviser in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction in the Penal Code of crimes on downloads on the Internet:
A. The downloading of a song would be an offence punishable by a sentence of six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros, is considered only as a fault (article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the penalty for downloading (section 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without authors' permission is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research titled: ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less’.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what co-workers earn.
The study was conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that when both people guessed that they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on this list, whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's List' (2006, not screened exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who prosecutes the fugitives and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of a claim, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, driving licence seniority, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the odds to pay.
It is for this reason that people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower claim rate than their precautions.
Similarly, using censuses, companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
As the frequency increases, the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when determining the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must carefully study the situation to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face a variety of disadvantages when entering into a contract with affordable insurance, such as low driving experience and seniority of the driver's license.
While it is ideal to be well insured to be a full-fledged insurance, other, more economical options exist.
The most foresighted drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with deductible, so that they get the coverage of all-risk insurance but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The portion of the claim amount that the client pays will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," specifies Luis Noguera, the head of Spain of First Europa, online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by for those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
I'll give you some advice.
If you are under 25 try to be cautious and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the price of the insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the base fare that the company has.
On the contrary, a sanction is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses ", clarifies Noguera.
After the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers to sign a contract with insurance, as the claim rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
This is why it is best to choose all-risk insurance with deductible.
"Normally, young people cannot take advantage of the experience gained after an accident," said the director of the European company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiates full-risk insurance, as long as his economic situation allows it.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest claims rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be a full-risk insurance with deductible (may be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
“They have a more casual drive and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises,” Noguera said.
For retirees, an all-risk insurance with deductible is preferable (the latter being 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible claims, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is fundamental to study properly the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the round of 16
AC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will meet next Tuesday at San Siro in search of the point they lack to reach their respective goals in the Champions League closing, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified in the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but they still need another point to make sure Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D games will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC is due to play the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the final on December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most awaited result, although both teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning they would stay first and ensure a better crossover in the eighths of the final.
A defeat by Gordon Strachan could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not be able to computer only on that since with nine points the games go to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hopes of qualifying for the eighth round for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extra time (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only come to Shakhtar, in case Celtic loses, to qualify for the eighth round to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without opportunities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their gig at Vancouver's GM Place stadium that the group's reunion is "bright".
Around 20,000 people sold out tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video in which the story of the band is told that made fury in the late 1990s.
The encounter and world tour coincided with the release of a new album that resumed their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI released in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage showcasing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had given them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience filling the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he will think of the show".
'Sporty Spice' who left the group in 1998 "because of differences between us" and which caused the group to disband two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people’s feelings have changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have worked out and we appreciate each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters awaited them.
She has five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will be exhibiting on 23 December.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is sounding the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas is raging between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of repercussions on oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are conveyed by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia’s monopoly-owned company supplying the gas, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would mean for Ukraine a 40 percent increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, remembering that we are a country through which most of the gas transits," Ukraine's economy minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters news agency.
“The fluctuations in gas costs would undoubtedly be related to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.”
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused Gazprom's supply to Ukraine to be interrupted in January 2006.
This has led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, thus increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of European Union supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stockpiles, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health "must control its foreign employees".
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve controls on its extra-community employees to check if they have previous penalties, the monitoring committee said.
The warning from the Editor-in-Chief, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no specific data on the number of overseas people it employs.
His report nonetheless highlighted other critical checks, properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor-General made checks on extra-community staff following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor serving at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving his jeep through the gates of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October on suspicion of being involved in various car blast attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Past Criminal Oversight, allowing employers to undertake controls over various countries.
"While we have discovered that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time," the report said.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health does most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas personnel is available to health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is uncertain whether these warnings could add any value."
The Scottish health authorities reported employing 1,161 overseas workers, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of the problems with identifying staff members with indefinite contracts, who may or may not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation showed that the current procedures of health authorities controls in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment controls for overseas health service personnel.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was excited to do this work in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Scottish Government, allied with the health committees, would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report expected to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment checks, valid for all employees, including overseas persons.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the biopic on Joy Division’s latest singer, Ian Curts, has garnered 5 awards, including Best Picture, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was hired to play Curtis in this film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Ms. Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Daniel Craig, the Bond star won the Variety Award for allowing the British film to be under international spotlight.
The awards were distributed during the ceremony at London's Round house.
Control chronicles Curtis's rise to success with Joy Division, until he committed suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film, whose score was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot with a budget of just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first for best director and the second for best beginner director.
Rock also won Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple’s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor Award went to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his tough character, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has shot films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of star Harris, who starred in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have given people like me access to cinema,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was amazed at this great actor today, I was extremely honored.”
The Independent Film Oscars, better known as the Bifas, are awarded by a jury of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells plotting an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and the armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following an unsuccessful 2006 Al Qaeda attack on the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, citing a statement from the interior minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell run by a “missile launch expert” who has infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counterband of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The government has urged clerics to do more against Saudi-led Iraqis, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting the Allied Forces and against the U.S.-allied Muslim Shiite government, considered heretical by the hardline Saudi Sunny.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have collaborated with the authorities to support the royal family’s policy that dominates the government.
Activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda leader of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five... months," the interior minister's spokesperson told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized in a "media cell" aimed at promoting "takfiri thought", the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus may have had Earth-like conditions, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation coupled with slower rotation, has led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a surface temperature warm enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency’s probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of Earth’s potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford’s Department of Physics, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
“Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus was originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface.”
Enriched uranium sequestered by the police.
One kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would be worth $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the task as a presidential candidate to answer a snowman’s questions.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters who have recorded their questions submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions asked were as ridiculous as that of another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked the Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected much the conditions of the Republican party, candidate for the next elections.
It is not known on what criteria, the producers of CNN, which sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest on a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong topics for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard funny things: The board raised approval increases when candidates spoke out rudely.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is leading the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (offering illegals regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to deepen this topic.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they began to fight immigration before and more incisively than the others.
Generally speaking, candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This topic, combined with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears towards the outside world, favor Republicans to forget, or to minimize, the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the gun control campaign.
John McCain and Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in the entirety of the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the Whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who was in the top spot in Iowa in a recent election thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, was not expected to declare the death penalty painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and declared that Jesus is too chic to run for office.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee’s ascent to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious grant searches conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistling during Wednesday’s debate.
These two emerged out of nowhere, thanks to the fact that the two party protégés could not agree on who was the best known and most traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a message of success about American greatness bringing leaders together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Labour
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of the British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra-marital toe sucked.
But now a revelation attests that a wealthy businessman would have concealed for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have been well off.
Two months ago, the prime minister backtracked on his proposed election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that the opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped instead to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, has stated that the terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the brink of crack, demonstrated a flaw in guidelines and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have prompted a coalition of industry groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative mess.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against military spending cuts: they proclaimed that being a defense minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of the Labour Party (and his former head of vigilance) have caused them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and they don’t trust them, but they usually put their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; the cabinets of ministers are taking stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is getting defensive and aimless.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was British Treasury Chancellor.
And even if he’s not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long-running investigation into the party’s funds “cash money for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think otherwise.
But the plight of Mr. Brown is not as tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party make it seem.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no casualties or scams.
And the cure, though painful, could be to materialize Mr. Brown’s long-standing Stalinist tendencies, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular figure who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of politicians’ big-subsidizers are clear, and they exist for good reason: The public has a right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams's programs, without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the head of grant collections who had spoken about the dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of it.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, resorting to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is up to the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards of Public Life, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financially of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good advantage for the election; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate flawless integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see stirred fins, swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures balance sheet shares that are not recoverable or are recoverable more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer loans, in part because of the weakness of cardholders.
It is still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody’s, a tax agency, the third-quarter insolvency rate of 3.89% is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly due to technical factors.
A change in laws in the United States in 2005 regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp drop in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly indebtedness that consumers have to settle.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infectious links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their indebtedness now that fair mortgages have disappeared.
But card issuers are paying more attention to cash flow than to the value of assets, and thus the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if the property costs less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card indebtedness would become a priority to repay the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of stocks.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and reassess all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market drive America into recession, the industry will certainly face a macabre future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to testify their roles in a fraud committed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first pleaded not guilty to seven counts of collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to make money despite their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous all over Britain because of the extradition procedures that have lasted two years.
In the United States, their case remains an outstanding issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges inflicted on them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, nicknamed the “Natwest Three” claim to have come to Houston in 2000 to stage a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped it rig bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's subsidiary interest for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers got $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britons were released following the payment of a $1 million bail each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh-largest national company, bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting fraud, could no longer hide its billions in debt or even offer its hoax speculations as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion in loss of market value, and more than $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the company’s collapse.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes have been in vain because of his death from a heart attack last year.
Neither money nor outside of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and having sufficient fuel range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $ 54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even though no one really needs so many seats since it’s more of a family aircraft or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at Gulfstream's booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Show, a four-day consumer incitement orgy held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was scrutinizing a shiny orange Porsche, displayed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing like our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second-largest private jet market.”
“Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were regarded as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerged as the world’s largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to Forbes listing the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the wealthy are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are globally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She attended the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Joueur de Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents bet on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, claim to be like their customers, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Yumatova, who grasped her haute couture dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems above all to be aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the corks to come up to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum knives, Mövenpick ice creams, custom billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears are on display.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, proudly posing at the Royal Delf factory stand for Dutch porcelain, in front of a handmade blue tile wall painting by Raimbrant.
“The Russians are more interested in bling bling.”
Indeed, the sellers here stated that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years old are too much by Russian standards) have already gone from glowing logos to a kind of limited-edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaire emissaries or tourists, walk the exhibition every day.
Some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of mattresses made of silk, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $ 170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three wristband-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car drawn for the Russian casino owner, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in property prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more than you might think”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company has erected four booths representing British telephone booths, filled with mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers-by arrested to throw masses of banknotes, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few millions.
“You see, here in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unapproved Surgeon Suspected of Manslaughter in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was looking through the window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and watching an ambulance just stopping at the gates of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
and then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone had died.
Authorities later learned that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, an assistant to the Newark Police Department director.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who has not yet been identified by police, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are confidently awaiting the results of toxicological tests that, alas, will take time, but which should solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant to Police Director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” McCarthy said of Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
“It was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done everything to protect me.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and left behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgical operation.
“This is an opportunity to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and having found Miss arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared deceased.
A little over a week has passed since then, and authorities haven’t said much about the investigation or even the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are investigating whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of Miss Castro's home where a faded rosebush lay in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked at the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in cooking and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two off-road bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Miss Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandoning her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to be careful about that,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
“It was embarrassing”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower rates linked to the effervescence of the global stock market.
Shares exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, subsequently lowering interest rates promoted by the U.S. central bank’s vice president’s soothing statements.
Stock markets are exploding in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in turbulent financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets given these new credit-related tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence has partly “reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market in late September and October.
Should this turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of a further tightening of financial conditions for homeowners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the US markets, and that further lower interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news on the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in home sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial turmoil was accentuated following the statement of Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will lay off 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of UK companies.
The German Dax index rose 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for a monthly tri-fund auction by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at the heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressures on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and ECB and inject further funds into London financial markets causing credit tensions, have caused the monthly "Libor" tri-loan rates of British banks, caused their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a strong rise since November 12.
England faces an appeal for judgment over the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the coaches who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make their decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the CEO of England, is starting to fill out the application forms to become a national coach, at least part-time.
Anyone who fails to win the No. 6 bib will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to bring Bopara out?
Is that fair to Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, who to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new executives with good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine a cricketer's level unless they are given at least one chance?
Numbers are important in decisions, but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketer for a day.
But capturing the eyes of selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in top form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 laps to win a spot.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer more.
Whether it will be Shah or Bopara playing at Asgiriya Stadium is just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and succeeded well in the first, with five doors and 40 laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricketer of the Test, and that, despite the fact that his double cent scored against Australia in Australia may still be underestimated.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and foster Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable debut in the innings of the Test of 88 in Bombay, 32 cents first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah only made ten laps in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his hometown of Middlesex, and that, the immediate rejection by the coaches when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently crashed into a 4x4 at a presentation by Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
He only reported minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was looking at him from a distance, to ask him “had he seen this?”
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his speed allows him to do services that fit him, and he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Is this the real art of selection?
I would be conducive to giving Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will be playing this weekend.
Buses take people back to work, and to fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping those exiles without money or visa renewals, or others hoping the city has regained normalcy.
Some have returned to fight against the militants who have driven them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival in Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to leave for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-assisted militia had helped drive al Qaeda west of the capital, and invited him back.
One of Jordan’s newcomers is the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been drawn to the capital’s growing calm since American troops arrived, and to the continuing training view of well-armed “involved citizen groups” collaborating with the US military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decay of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed suspicion about visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than 2.5 million people have reportedly fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” Sunni said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis have been driven from Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will once again escalate sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Small Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in vocational training, and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Saarians, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a Saarian no, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-deprecation, posters for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is ranked fifth in the training monitor at the Institute for German Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high proportion of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
The Saarland also leads the country's children to higher schools in above-average numbers - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
"In Saarland, we benefit from the vocational training system," says Axel Plunnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people obtain their degree in a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Also the possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
Due to the number of inhabitants, the double-study panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has forced higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering science subjects.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federal state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the final year of nursery school is free of entitlement - a model that other federal states are also copying in the meantime.
Only future comparison studies will be able to show whether students' performance is improving sustainably.
In PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of students at risk fell from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of the Sarreans, the knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by the PISA studies - otherwise one could earn points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in high schools - even if the Saarians are not French.
Chavez sets the clocks
In Venezuela, watches will soon tic-tac differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the half-hour timer in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez has become a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela communicated, due to a new law, the watches will be set at least four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chavez justified his position among other things by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chavez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, due to a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations either with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
“I can’t, just because of my dignity,” Chávez said, rushing to a constitutional reform that the country’s citizens will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations on the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have “sput in the face” of Venezuela with this decision, criticized Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chavez is in every mouth.
A new cell phone ringtone makes fury in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was angered by the constant interpellations of left-wing populists and told him to shut up.
Lower wages threaten Germany in 2007.
In spite of the strong economic situation, a real decrease in wages threatens German workers this year, according to a forecast.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease on their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies with the weak wage development, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told Bild newspaper.
There could also be new charges in terms of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned 3.3 per cent reduction in unemployment insurance for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion in food and hydrocarbon prices had pushed the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent year-over-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus resembles Earth more than previously thought: the European space probe Venus Express has discovered lightning flashes in the atmosphere and windswirls at the poles, similar to those appearing in winter on Earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists have been assuming that there are flashes of lightning on Venus.
The European spacecraft "Venus Express" has today provided proof - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus bursts at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud in cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprin, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the thunderstorm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: “If there was life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be few living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but she remains a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ESA mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important milestone in Venusian research, as no probes had been on the way for exploration of this planet since the nineties.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles in "Nature" do not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than assumed at first.
In addition to the wind whirlwinds already known at the North Pole, the researchers found a cloud whirlwind at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called the evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth as carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Köhler, demands an end to the parties' quarrel over the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and sums up the Grand Coalition to close the quarrel over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches that she would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
“China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained about the CDU's "front-up policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government not only decommissioned German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from the Spiegel, it also froze the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that the Dalai Lama’s welcome was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, Wen Jiabao thus supported the Chinese position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also encompasses other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots such as those in France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets by violence, demanded the German Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burning, burglars shooting police with shotguns: after the serious youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not build up in our own country and defuse into violence.
We must take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this is already showing its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end to the alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems nor from the point of view of urbanism as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the past nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government were demanded by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat stresses that the share of unemployed youth under 25 from immigration would be above average.
Above all, more training places should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many immigrant youth also do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat exhorted, "But we must still be careful."
It should be "fast to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with spotlights.
Authorities reported three arrests and a few cars and garbage burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, unrest overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots erupted after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor’s utopian entry shows that the coalition is done with the bottom line – and that there is nothing left to expect from her.
In which country does this chancellor live?
After her desolating intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics was pushed back by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous phrase.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed by that that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made it visible to everyone how accurate this reproach was.
There was neither concrete interest nor feelings for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, who runs away in foreign policy and who even there remains in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, she welcomes again and again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate goals should be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of oneself - having so little modesty, the CDU leader would have refused it even two years ago.
Now she clings to all-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
In doing so, she destroys her image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases for that.
In this regard, it is revealing the number of times she makes lapses when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to utter a half-precise sentence.
She hesitates in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle – and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already erupting on the first topic.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the illegals", Mitt Romney reproaches his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
“I would say that his own house was a haven for illegals,” Giuliani replied, blaming the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates rise to the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have uploaded via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
“It’s with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power,” McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also being vigorously taught by Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn what is known as "waterboarding," a method of interrogation that simulates drowning, as torture.
However, the fact that the campaign’s important themes meanwhile go beyond the war in Iraq and debates on torture is seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Common Room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax hikes are denied, applause is pouring through the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites are revealed once again.
“I made a mistake at the time,” Romney said, apologizing to the base and the television audience for being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, falls into a sinking knot when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil.
A day after his retirement as army chief, Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army end.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the Nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power by a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of the civil state.
With this withdrawal from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another requirement of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the state of emergency with lawyers from his ranks, rejected all appeals against the head of state's controversial October 6 re-election last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghan border.
The Krautrock fathers are back.
The supergroups of the Germany of the seventies are playing again: the three members of the group Harmonia have again taken their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return have appeared recordings of their great hit "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The anticipated sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left by 57-year-old Michael Rother, who is in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, among others even a Beat.
And sometimes this is added inadvertently to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia plays again has secured some emotion among the fans of Krautrock.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name reasoned in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a lasting way that this group has been so painfully missing for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German also have the right to celebrate his living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne-based group Can for their work, we saw the questioning German pop faces in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in panegyric praise, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the stage of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and during this period, the power of impact that was felt was much weaker than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly troubleshoot in Kraftwerk and had finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster into exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, on a former Weser farm, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
Supposedly there was in the garbage bin a Harmonia Ottenstein choir banner and also a name for art.
Many have kept Harmonia away from this.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvesting of dead wood was not used alone in the search for self.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just been released was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as someone thinks they remember.
Rother issued at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
This was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The band announced their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since become more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We owe Griessem's Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been unearthed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the paperback book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of Krautrock's influence would be circumscribed with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase hovers in the room amidst the singular sounds: “The only real music, you listen to the future.”
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of tools wired in bazaar are used for the formation of the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and drums, to draw instruments with unprecedented sounds thanks to the effects instruments built by yourself.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three of them are great technocrats.
Even the chorus of the house will not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never rock.
The roots were less sought-after in the blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight from artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia too is no longer irritated by this anymore.
But what is most self-evident will be thoroughly covered on the stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
It can hit someone’s nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Lethal Peace", two films once again address the Balkan War.
But the two do not convince.
Either the projects rely too much on action and on the exchanges of senseless shots or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is precisely there, in the darkest hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is found.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because far too many nice and futile roles in movies with feelings for women and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him in the desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch anyway "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why do today's movies have to be as long and confusing as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of nods: deep down, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument to its decline, has nevertheless kept visible remains of his old charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Paix meurtrière", which also comes out this week, the endless sequel to failed films on the Balkan war.
"Lethal Peace" can be quickly prosecuted: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovo snipers, in which one of the two still falls quickly in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not for once presented as the sole causes of all evils, this film as flat as a telefilm is too quickly lost in the action and the exchange of senseless shots.
It remains a kind of "Cobra 11 Alarm" without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why at bottom there has never been a real good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track the high war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another writer (both at once Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go in a small team into the forest, to accomplish something that the military can’t do and for the two males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as he was presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to her a romantic affair with a Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, achieves what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have not succeeded in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving him for a just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague should be charged with a crime against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) of not conducting the hunt fairly intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and the wicked are this time so similar that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
One speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet’s worktable: “Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tired it is to be wicked.”
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but they hint at how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of movies about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all the Hollywood movies about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been good movies about South Africa before.
What’s worth every time: when a star hangs out on a crisis hotbed or a minefield, something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Jenseits go Grenzen” with Angelina Jolie or “Blutdiamanten” with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have still passed before Hollywood could make a good holocaust movie with "Schindler's List."
Some films still have to mature - those that are worth classic works on Vietnam today "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were by no means unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But maybe today we know just too much about the world's conflicts, where every hecatombe comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this delighted the writers the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Dictator” actually became as good as well because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps it is necessary to have the sarcastic and distant artistic gaze of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change."
“The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in horrific ways, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust is critical of the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's backlash against Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has met with fierce criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of odds.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described the abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz urges the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new, longer-term starting point, "which takes as its starting point another modified agenda."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday in his previous statements, according to which Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation at the beginning of December, regarding the candidacy of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us, that in the time span we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance.”
The dream, however, does not belong definitively to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s remarks.
This would give the impression that Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would be more in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have described Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks appointed Hamburg as the candidate city.
The mayor’s SPD faction has criticized the Senate for not using this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
“The development of Little Grasbrook has been rejected by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics card and excluded housing construction,” said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for the Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a later use of housing, the CDU would have bet exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have raised a lot of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg had broken with Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
The one who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden case, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
Much of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now leads to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes" of which the former director of the Pontus Hulten museum gave a copy of the Moderna in 1995.
Ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powdered soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered by right into the history of art and auctioning, as authorized original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum falsely claimed later that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol later ceded to him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmö in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies dating back to the year 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was directly applied without a layer of background to the laminate panels, using a paint roller - moreover, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These cases have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," suggests the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come up with another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes as a collection."
Already in July, the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since then there has been an inexorable silence.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Abandon
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers abandoned, the same ones who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the president for corruption and election fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The loyal soldiers in power had stormed the hotel shortly before with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court Wednesday over a failed coup attempt in 2003 — including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse himself with about 30 supporters.
The military police, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal troops in power blocked the area around the respectable hotel.
The Chair convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
“People are tired,” said Trillanes.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who commanded before the Scout Rangers elite unit, said other army units would soon be joining the march.
Critics of the regime had called for a major demonstration against the president on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila was already the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke up nearly 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as reported by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the share capital would be held.
We’ve speculated about a buyout before.
The option would remain open to further increase the stake in Versatel.
This step is aimed at accelerating the consolidation of the German DSL market, said United Internet.
Shortly before, assumptions had already been made Wednesday about an entry, after the Berenberg bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third party, it is said in the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch listed 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies founded the joint venture MSP to absorb competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
Both companies would, however, allow themselves all the options open, especially to increase the participation in the SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
Poker that is still difficult to predict on Freenet, which has lasted for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers linked by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
The United Internet and Drillisch Holding had until now a direct interest in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about an additional four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of investment firm Vatas had already been decided in August.
