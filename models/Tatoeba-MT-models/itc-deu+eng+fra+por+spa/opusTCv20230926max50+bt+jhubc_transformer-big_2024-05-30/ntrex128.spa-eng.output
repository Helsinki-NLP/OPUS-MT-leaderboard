Members of the Assembly (AM) of Wales are concerned about "muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are baffled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Assembly member stated that his group was concerned "that it would stay with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly and pwp means poop.
A member of the Welsh Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "unhappy" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation jump from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be the responsibility of the Members themselves."
The Welsh Government’s 2017 law gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals that revealed broad support for calling the Parliament of Wales the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option gained most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, Members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring Assembly President Elin Jones to her head, who should submit the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say in the question of what they should be called when deliberating on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the country’s name change
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells remain silent over the hardships of Harlem churches
“Historically, the older people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods that neighbors regularly go to.”
With respect to churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of goods will not last as long as leaders expect and that “sooner or later, they will return to the starting point.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and will therefore speed up the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshipping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of St. Martin, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were reluctant to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged and, while Father Johnson’s parishioners made plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called it “the campaigns of the poor.”
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first chime in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left to play the chime of Riverside Church, larger, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "attempted to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for locusts in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the day the lobster season opened, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help, so he approached with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then realized that "he was screaming that he had been bitten."
,
He had his collarbone shattered,” Hammel observed as he approached the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark,” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children’s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The first responder, Captain Larry Giles, said at a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans boost UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specializing in the hallways of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 trillion and with growth on the rise compared to falling sales in fashion and household appliances, the largest beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if surpassed successfully, the same will be done in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the shelf space that used to be allocated to televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also test its concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online stores and the shift to buying small amounts of food daily in local stores force supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said the stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets in hundreds of establishments and introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted grocery sales and further monetized these acquisitions.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide revenue from point-of-sale pharmaceuticals at its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of Sainsbury’s 281 pharmaceutical establishments to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will be involved in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer Paul Mills-Hicks commented: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty hallways in a way that empowers the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specialized staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offerings are designed to fit every need, while an attractive environment and a comfortable location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old-fashioned way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Is 'Rage' After Holly Willoughby Breaks <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones was “furious” after TV host Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million-pound deal with her lifestyle line of business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time to devote to the Truly fashion and accessories brand.
This business had compared it to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources consulted, Jones was “furious” when the TV golden girl admitted that her new deals, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, didn’t leave time to dedicate to Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The deal had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was outlined as a favorite to double Willoughby’s fortune of about 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source said, “Truly was by far Holly’s top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her going for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved totally stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow headquarters, products ready to go on sale.”
Experts believe the departure of the hostess of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delaying its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were vacationing together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night “there was no talk of business issues.”
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider “unpresidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up on so many things?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of “newscaster.”
"I haven't given up on anything."
He said Kim was interested in meeting with him again after Trump praised the first meeting held in Singapore in June, which he considered a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders gathered at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an "adequate response" from the U.S. to the first steps toward North Korea's disarmament.
On the contrary, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s outlook was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
“We get along great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: an end to missile tests, help free hostages and bring the remains of U.S. soldiers back home.
He also defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to people standing right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had had to move, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not request international assistance, which complicates things a bit," explains Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are still unsure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide help.
Considering that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not as many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, travelling from one island in Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has made upgrading Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign, and has allocated enough money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr Joko, who faces re-election next year.
In addition, it must cope with the pressure of Indonesia’s persistent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch this: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equals score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 meters from Chelsea’s goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second stick.
The action sent him over the area and headed for the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very far ahead, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think too much, I just fired the shot."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midfielder made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before turning around dribbling near midfield and entering Liverpool's field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out into the midfield.
Then he made a nice pass into space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defender and threw the ball into the net from the second post with a left-footed kick that Liverpool's Alisson Becker couldn't stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesian Tsunami Death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's emergency agency said early Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the debris of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday that unleashed waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Was Stabbed to Death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. stabbed at Grayson Mews on John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to capture something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman came to the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his flat, but police tell him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was perplexed when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now informed that they will be allowed to re-enter in a few hours.
Someone heard an officer tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cord and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cord controlling the floor block.
Anyone with information is asked to email DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, Sept. 30, Record 247.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the latest commemorative success for "rewriting history"
Their ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate about removing statues, it was inevitable that getting Oliver Cromwell out of the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
The wrong Cromwell may be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than at present, an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If it is a completely accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Killer Pig Attacks Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a rancher in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his last name "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered in blood near a slum in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as the South China Morning Post newspaper reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs from a pig herd in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby slum was open.
He said there was a big pig in the puddle with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-kilogram pig had attacked the farmer to the death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and shattered,” the cousin, whom they are addressing by his last name, “Wu,” told The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belonged neither to Yuan nor to his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It seems that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, this is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 295 pounds cornered a farmer on his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After pigs were eaten at an Oregon rancher in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “shooter.”
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What we have to do is have the right respect for them,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rainfall in the southwestern U.S.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused gusts of wind of more than 136 km / h, a category 1 hurricane from Sunday at five in the morning (Eastern time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are beginning to be generated, moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to drive intense tropical rains northward, toward the U.S. Southwest.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when tropical rain clashes with the approaching low pressure, there will be widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rainfall will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical rainfall will cause rainfall of nearly 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall, sudden flooding with rapidly aggravating conditions may occur.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended at all to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into bumpy rivers and storms will cause gusty winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rainfall in specific parts of the southern California coast.
Torrential rains may leave up to two centimeters of water, which could cause small streams of debris and make the roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical gales will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain generalizes late on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
Some intense temperature changes in the U.S. can be observed in October due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes this involves drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the central U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 7-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
A warm beginning of October is expected in much of the central and eastern U.S., with widespread temperatures ranging from about 26 degrees from the Southern Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures of up to 26 degrees could be reached in New York, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high odds of above-average temperatures for the U.S. East during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s appearance
More than 20 million people followed the heartbreaking testimony that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, gave Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, policy was still at a standstill and the media was interrupting its usual schedule to broadcast Friday’s latest news — a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a state of drunkenness and that he tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that hadn’t happened.
More than 20.4 million people that Nielsen commented on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football game of the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose members have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, fuels the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had $3.1 million, NBC had $2.94 million, MSNBC had $2.89 million and CNN had $2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Judiciary Commission.
While receiving these reproaches, broadcast live on CNN, he was devastated.
“Looking me in the face,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He added: “You have power when there are so many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he would tell more in his appearance before the Commission.
Cable television and broadcasting networks broadcast everything live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Senate to vote on.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate over the next week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators subsequently, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was critical, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'doing politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" about Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers’ alleged Brexit plan, saying a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge each other’s tariffs was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of Death of LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree homicide charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police say they admitted to shooting Wayde.
A bond of $350,000 has been set, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge East District Court of Instruction released a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Unit, the State Police Forensics Lab, Southern University Police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s sports director, thanked the area’s police forces for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
“These are the things people always care about,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police Clash with Catalan Separatists Before Independence Referendum Anniversary
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after independence protesters clashed with riot fighters as thousands took part in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
There were also clashes in later hours and police used batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups, with messages such as "no forgetting or forgiving," clashed with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was low, as people who were against secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to avoid a demonstration supporting the National Police.
The demonstration went on, but she was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy to be able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, the pro-Catalan parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for ramming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the entrances and the building itself.
At some point, you may have shot the car with a crossbow.
Menga attack gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers with a second loss to Steven Gerrard in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference. Gary Holt's attackers climbed one spot, with the Hibernian in second position.
This season, Gerrard’s team has not yet won any away wins and next Sunday they face the Hearts, leader of the table with an eight-point lead.
Previously, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston are extending their streak of wins in the division to six games. Holt, starting coach, has not yet tasted defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a blunt visitor
Holt’s team had to have been one step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson overcame the defense, but failed in front of the goal, and then Alan Lithgow got the kick off after getting in to finish off Craig Halkett's center of the head in front of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with stop-and-go plays.
This is how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston sought an inning, with a combined Declan Gallagher and Robinson play for Menga, hitting the ball and scoring from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession, but couldn’t get past the host’s defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was pretty quiet.
That game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor rejected a shot from Scott Pittman from a kick, and Lithgow was away from another Livingston move.
The Livingston area was constantly filled with long passes, but they were always cleared. Two penalty requests were rejected, one after Halkett's entry on substitute Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
Livingston's "phenomenal" (analysis)
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His style of play and squad have barely changed since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they fell short.
They failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to enter the opposing field once, which is a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers marched in the immediate vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Deptford traffic accident: cyclist dies after colliding with vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy highway in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by the paramedics, but died there.
The crash comes after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that ran off on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from the scene of Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation in a high-security male prison, according to the Prison Directorate.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and continue.
Specialists from an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight inmates and affecting a pavilion participate.
Officers received assistance for minor facial injuries on site.
A prison service spokesperson said: “Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
Violence is not tolerated in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.”
The Long Lartin Prison hosts more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It’s unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa’s latest outbursts cross the desert’s southwest, at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rains late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes have retained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rainfall, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Escarpment, in Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rosa rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, it is likely that some of these torrential rains will be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the itinerary of Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico’s Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, who on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum bursts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is encountering cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to land in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout Monday afternoon.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"Torrental rains of between 7 and 15 centimeters are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters," as reported on weather.com.
Afterwards, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then move through Arizona south of Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or her wreckage is heavy torrential rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center notes.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested as suspects of an assassination attempt after another 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the pettiness and anger' of the Democratic Party
“To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered the pettiness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on the allegation.
On Saturday, the president said, on that day, the “Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the bravery” of Kavanaugh.
"To vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a jurist with an admirable track record at the service of the public," he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh’s candidacy by talking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“It’s five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not presenting myself, but it’s a race,” he said.
“That’s why I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump claimed the Democrats are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, rising toll
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves ravaging the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When yesterday it was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it ravaged everything on land," said Nugroho, who said the tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s great earthquake was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “major” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received criticism for failing to report a tsunami hit Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a footage captured by a fan and shared on social media, a man was heard on the top floor of a building warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, taking buildings and cars in front.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but evacuees still need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has reopened for relief only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit Paul’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under tarps installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as aid groups were setting up disaster assistance gears, some people lamented that co-operators with extensive experience were not being allowed to move to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a catastrophe at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Indonesia.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn’t happened yet.”
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of those still missing still had hopes that their loved ones would be the miracles that bring some light to the bleak stories that natural disasters write.
On Saturday, a small child was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor with Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“From my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the disclosure of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival that was held on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a check mark in gray, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 while charging at an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed a Brink employee who was charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located at the leisure center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man "runs behind Brink's employee" and steals a bag of the money earmarked for recharging.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: “The person formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while now, a name he used as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year as he spoke about the album’s title with radio announcer Big Boy.
“It’s you, it’s us, it means us.
It went from being Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in uppercase or lowercase, with or without a hyphen.
The Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use the military against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country approaches.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would “never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking hold throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double I.A. funding.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and I.A. professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements regarding A.I. from various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official A.I. strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become No. 1 in innovation in IA by 2030.
"Duplicating the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. We're looking forward to the next breakthrough in the field of I.A.," says Lee.
Twice as much funding means twice the chance that the next big achievement in I.A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that beat Othello’s best American player. Later, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee gave recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would allow the next generation of visionaries to be identified.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking academic leaders away; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired prominent people from universities to work in I.A.
Lee commented that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China funds people from academic institutions just as the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from industry and academia, while the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has taken no action in months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change their country’s name
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their name would change to "Republic of North Macedonia," a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its bid for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav population, mostly in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether participation will reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum ballot asked the following question: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies like the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at one o'clock in the afternoon, no irregularities had been reported.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote in the Macedonian referendum on a name change of the country that would open the avenues for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs in front of tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would bring the much-needed investment Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20%.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research it was assured that between 30 and 43% of the voters would participate in the referendum, which is a participation less than the required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
Should it fail, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch this: Manchester City's Sergio Agüero dodges all of Brighton's defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling blew up Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the play.
He raced between three Brighton defenses before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He dodged one defender before overtaking several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Agüero has some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the lead in the Premier League contender.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball deep within Brighton's territory.
He made a nice ball pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few taps before directing Sterling to the second stick.
The Sky blues striker threw the ball into the net just before he crossed the line.
City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies' party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to step foot on the mound Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Dodgers, who triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Western Division, still have playoff opportunities.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still pursuing their first division title.
“Although we didn’t play anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve ever faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but they seem inclined to let Scherzer throw in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when talking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s one of the most important ones. I don’t present myself, but it’s a race, so I’m going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates,” he said.
“We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see the meanness, the evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to go over in order to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“We’ve seen it these last four days,” he said, saying the Democrats “were angry, they were bad, horrible and fake.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee appointing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received booing from the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already embraces a wide range of views.
He is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row of Labour Members of Parliament who are told they are not welcome, and only to say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment as being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe. It is ironic that they were issues in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years that I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Sadly, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "kinder and kinder" policy is already more than forgotten, if it was really enforced at some point.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether the party leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and take positions he would never have agreed with, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never flee.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every “censorship” motion or every change in the selection rules, the party gets narrower.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice that recommended I keep my head down and not make myself heard that much and that “would be fine.”
But I haven't gotten into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a high school student, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, not even in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political stances or the areas where I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand this desire to waste time and energy on issues about my allegiance to the leader of the Labour Party when the country heads for a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and utilities.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the match may have to some extent decided the final result, but, no doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this very entertaining game of the Tennent's Premiership day.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team out of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to take better advantage of the opportunities, that gave the home team victory, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“We’ve been tested in every game and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie commented: “Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot got an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, right in halftime, scoring and turning a solo rehearsal, which left the score 17-5 in favor of Ayr on the break.
However, the Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, narrowed this gap to five points.
Then there was a long break from a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be pulled out on a stretcher, and, when the game resumed, Ayr was ahead with a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall converted to Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, Ayr's captain, allowed Melrose to take advantage again of the fact that they had one more man with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when Struan Hutchinson was shown the yellow card for scoring Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson rehearsed when he was in the back of the advancing maul.
Climo converted it, just as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent wing Gregor Henry to the bottom to take over the fifth rehearsal of the locals.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move into the catering sector after revealing that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though a source in the Scottish Sun said Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "blooming catering market."
"The sea belongs to us": a landlocked Bolivia has the hope that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings they wave navy blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases display the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
“Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the nineteenth century, in addition to the desire to sail again on the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a resolution of the International Court of Justice by October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice’s ruling on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is waging a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final pleadings indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have hindered it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to complete nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to deliver on promises made during a summit held in Singapore between rival leaders.
His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume paralyzed nuclear talks more than three months after the summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to subdue the North, is a “chimera.”
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament moves beforehand.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, widespread skepticism reigns over Pyongyang’s seriousness of giving up an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or totally protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric oversized hats for their spring summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the runway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other oversized complements were watermelons with jewelry, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of quirky masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than couture.
One creation resembled a full scuba gear, snorkel and glasses included, while another looked like a cone of melted ice cream.
If you like big-sized fashion, you’re in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could begin to be seen on the streets of shops.
The big hats arrive by stepping on "The Bomb", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this impractical hat that flooded social media presented another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag as large as the model in swimsuit that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, “Next summer, I expect to see huge hats and beach bags on shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary exam results that is reinforced by individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the highest level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is noted that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, he reaches to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you can’t rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages scored A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that are part of the SCIS, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental competence that both children and young people will need in the future without a doubt.
At present, as a subject, languages are considered to be at the same level as CTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent colleges and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of employers’ reasons for the difficulties they encountered in filling jobs were attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of which career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically overtake the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
If they speak several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centers will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools you can always choose between several languages taught by teaching staff specialized in this subject.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At the moment, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be considered "competence for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron debuts with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a few limited minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game pre-season program.
“At this stage of my career I don’t need pre-season matches to prepare,” he said.
Time of Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate’s confirmation vote to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court on hold, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s appearances by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which were strained over allegations of sexual misconduct and have put an anticipated Senate confirmation vote on hold for at most a week while the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November election gain momentum.
President Trump’s campaign said next week’s five rallies are intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they retain in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, the rally tonight could attract "Ohio and Pennsylvania" supporters as well as have coverage in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows they dare to fight to keep hope alive in the face of Sunday’s individual games.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse swing pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players truly believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
“We were six points ahead and now we’re four, so I guess that’s a small boost,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel that they have some wind in their favor and reasons to be excited, among other reasons for the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
The guttural shouts of celebration grew in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game as he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the game on the 15th was greeted with a similar scream, from those who broadcast that they believe the American team has not yet been left out.
“We need to redouble our efforts and focus on the game,” Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe wears four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way its energy flows with the bustling public make it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there won’t be other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, the two at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four balls, after partnering with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn’t get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see up close because you appreciate the interactions between couples, the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead over the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe ahead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe started with a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 result over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods, four points ahead of Le Golf National.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made a lot of mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs eight points out of Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four Ryder Cup games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to defeat a discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who hadn't excelled much in Saturday's two games, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes games, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to be Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as references for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They got a thrilling 2-1 win over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing both opening holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovering from a four-point difference in individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a draw to keep it.
Although they have been second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says there is "no chance" that they will disarm first unilaterally if they have no confidence
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations that continuing sanctions deepened its mistrust of the United States and that there was no chance that its country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the international body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States," he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances, there’s no chance we’ll disarm first unilaterally.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons sooner.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, including by objecting to a declaration of an end to the war," Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and Moon Jae, South Korea’s leader, over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea had been the stakeholder in denuclearization instead of the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles toward U.S. soil after “evil president” Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim “rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in advancing disarmament, but said much remained to be done and that sanctions needed to continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set deadline for this: “It can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we make definitive and fully verified denuclearization a reality.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo spoke to Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea denounced that his "demands were those of a mobster."
At a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States implemented “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had communicated to him that the “corresponding measures” he sought were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all college students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing sexist culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her senior year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basics on how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance, and the importance of establishing a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change student behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He said the culture of pride for “staying the night on the line” still exists, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure students are under meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and a good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, that’s why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical biology and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it to the entire campus.
He hopes the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitting the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal tombs Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression away from home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox wanted their first away win since February 4-1 at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 coaching games, leaving his team eight points behind the hearts, who are leading the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga’s attack came minutes before halftime and the Rangers’ under-inspired lineup was not up to the task at any time.
Now, the Rangers drop to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, behind the Hibernian for the difference in goals.
The Rangers may find themselves in more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly threw an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard switched to eight of the starters who won the match against Ayr, entering the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 Livingston players who snatched a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way their very organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored two minutes from the start, when Menga made a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs made an in-depth foul for Captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out by the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson turned a deaf ear to the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely found himself struggling to cope with Lassana Coulibaly’s header and Ovie Ejaria’s boring pitch.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by Livingston came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers couldn’t cope with Jacobs’ deep stop-and-go play.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher snapped the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and handed it to Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the steering wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's might have had more lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a corner header that didn't come in.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty toward the end of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and Counting... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since been a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Coronado's Bells, starring actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of jeans scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
By putting on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so they can “see” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer,” such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't turn out well.
Kanye West was booed at the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to rant against the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to a white person and he asks me how I can like Trump if he’s racist.
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began Matt Damon’s sketched show in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's bronca to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes wearing that cap.
“They messed with me.
They told me not to go out with the cap on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and added that he was "going to put on his superman cloak, because that meant no one could tell him what he had to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments received booing from the public on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, one person told the magazine, "The studio was totally silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West bewildered many when he took to the stage to sing I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from TPUSA Conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING TO THE MUCHUMMER."
Interview host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying their music or their clothes, or supporting their art) who I consider to be embracing and spreading an ideology dangerous to my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, not forgetting the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear on Monday at the Belfast Court of First Instance.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the male hero stereotype, saying those on-screen roles often conveyed to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes “something has gone wrong” and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones castmate Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he finds it “quite important” to address this issue.
“Personally, I think it’s pretty important right now, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems that are being seen now?”
Kit believes that television may have some of the responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its so masculine characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it’s clear that something has gone wrong with the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any Game of Thrones prequel or sequel when the series ends next summer, stating that he is “fed up with battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard’s play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he’s ever made from Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, she’s given me my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on a farm belonging to Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way has been reduced almost entirely, Chinese health authorities said at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from GOP senators and asserts that they are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three GOP senators on Wikipedia's pages about lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were prompted by commentators and “far-right” websites.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The information reportedly included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel session regarding allegations of sexual misconduct made against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
“This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not at all responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement drew immediate criticism on the Internet, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Deny this information with anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests not the temperance necessary to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t get angry.
He must not rebel.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to want to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday’s appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who seeks to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very serious,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations.”
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are found out," he continued, "and that they are held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English Review: Back in Action: Rowan Atkinson's Spy Parody Gets Short
It has now become a tradition to look for Brexit nods in any new film with a British focus. It seems that this is what it corresponds to do with this new installment of the parody action and comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satire about how clearly foolish we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to mess up for a second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinema territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to splurge on glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that kind that played a single note on the subject of Fire Chariots that was played at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, it was originally based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in the already forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last installment, there are one or two good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as the propellers crashed into the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps in, but the humor is pretty short and it's oddly superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comic ingredients seamlessly.
Humor seems more aimed at children than adults and, to me, Johnny English’s absurd misadventures are not as witty and accurate as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated topical argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the dismay of the on-duty agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and cornered character who is watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character who is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to turn to one who is retired.
That has to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches in a fag school, although he gives unofficial classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, since it is a spy academy similar to that of Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his long-suffering former buddy Bough, once again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not taken advantage of enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding in Volta’s luxurious yacht; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house.
Definitely, they were used thoroughly in that last sequence, but, as funny and loud as it is, the ensemble still conveys a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they charge five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to think of a radical plan that the British would work with four days a week, but would charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business owners to allocate the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would “fit” into the party’s plans and economic agenda to tip the country in favor of workers.
This shift to a four-day week has received support from the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: An announcement of a review of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day working week is definitely an issue that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, not all Labour support this decision for the time being.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day workweek is not part of the party’s policy and will not be discussed at this time.”
The shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference held last week to expose his idea of carrying out a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "taking advantage" of companies that provide public services.
The shadow minister’s plans also include the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies will not regain their full stake, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of directors of companies and create inclusive ownership funds in which 10% of the shares of private sector companies should be allocated to employees, which would mean annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into allegations made against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for confirmation as a Supreme Court judge for at least a week and raises the question of whether the findings could influence any Republican senator who ultimately decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators whether John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham could uncover information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, sharp.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immovable.
“I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the prosecution,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it sharply," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she appoints have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it succeeded in reducing poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive all-star billboard gathers for an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people move to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concertgoers have had to complete a number of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved 12 years after reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of so-called “cliticism,” which is called the stance we take when we think we’re doing something really useful by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have gotten world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its shares, of which, at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based association of investors and executives united with the common commitment to "helping children grow and develop to their full potential", to this end, they have proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens contributors.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of the social injustice of malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for “The Power of Nutrition,” told the crowd during an April 2018 concert in London.
The group also stated that after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen contributor responded: “It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the movements for human rights and against apartheid have done before, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances that we will have at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to carry out blockade on Russia's energy exports - Interior Ministry
“If necessary,” Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from rocking markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
“I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, just as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe,” he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods of addressing this issue.
“The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up in the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to harness and replace fuels,” he said, noting that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims come as the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relieve Russia of its role, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do so, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which reaches a value of 11 billion dollars and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is purely economic and is yet another example of unfair competition.
"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Energy Secretary, last September in Moscow.
The US stance has, however, met with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It poses a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was addressing this challenge.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and for there to finally be women among the leaders,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a City Hall appearance and claimed that he was “taking the country on the wrong path.”
“I’m really concerned about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren stated that "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
A poll was released Thursday in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run for the 2020 election.
58% of Massachusetts “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
However, 32% of respondents supported their candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the previous governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% of support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other well-known members of the Democratic Party talked about the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at a Donald Trump Rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation that my son is going through, for everything that has happened since he came back, is well known to the other families who are suffering from the effects of PTSD and other wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience who gathered at a pro-Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the big taboo that no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "come back with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all other members of the military, have given to their country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to get a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district filed a “friendly” letter Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker who faces the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name has not been revealed in the “Grace v. Sessions” case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in the country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine made a statement Friday saying the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
“Under federal law, all asylum applications must be ruled on by virtue of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also indicated in the letter that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by claiming that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and "suppose a necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“People who leave their countries of origin on the grounds of persecution or threats based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or a particular political opinion can apply for asylum,” Sessions said when announcing the directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people all over the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
“The situation is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her baby with a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search among the few drowned belongings they have left in an effort to retrieve what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has his back and shoulder broken, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous aftershocks, also very strong.
He couldn’t help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to get safe.
I was trapped in the wreckage of the crumbling wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, as he and his family were in town to hold a wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're all right."
US ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily pay supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to meddle in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, something China flatly denies.
Trump’s accusation of Beijing’s attempt to influence the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials pointed to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign initiated by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to post advertisements to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a mounting trade war that has led them to raise tariff levels on imports by both sides.
China’s countervailing tariffs that were applied at the start of the trade war were thought to fall on exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, which is one of the main exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, China “is further intensifying that pressure with ad postings in our free press.”
“To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America’s cherished tradition of free speech and free press when it attempts to publish a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, you see only a few disagreeing voices and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that their country’s economy is taking, as the media is controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most relevant newspapers evaded the offer to publish” his article, though he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts say Republicans are distancing themselves from women ahead of midterm voting with Kavanaugh's debacle
As many prominent Republicans are closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that there may be a setback, especially by women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have said they want to move forward with the vote.
“It’s not possible to back down on these kinds of issues,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said she doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s latest attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters disgusted with the matter.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters gathered at the doors of the Senate chanted “November is coming!” as the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats is out of the question,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the repercussion is already very relevant and indeed it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among undecided women in suburban neighborhoods and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who don’t usually vote even though they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony in which he detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that a setback could occur if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
“This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s no longer just a matter of the committee’s vote or the final vote, not even whether Kavanaugh is on the bench; it’s also about how Republicans have handled all of this and how they have treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA.
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they don’t know who they should believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are taking sides with the latter.
In a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents say they believe Ford’s testimony definitively or likely, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh definitively or likely.
In addition, 38% said they thought that, in all likelihood or definitively, Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s statements, as well as at least those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh raped her while drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party while he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project in the technology legend. A company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world."
“It has to be now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so users can create their own “online personal data storage” or a POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
One thing that is unique in storing personal online data is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the staffed developers who were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change is going to be introduced where all their business models are completely modified overnight.
"We're not going to ask for permission."
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that “its mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the net neutrality debate.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, her two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned him the decoration from his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "crossing a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage", advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “so great that I can never get to his height, but they were very instructive.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a wreath after the parade, which featured the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evident when shown such a large backing."
MMA fans were up all night for the Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay up all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so that in the end they won’t let you see the main event.
The San Jose poster had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some weren’t surprised after having to stay up until early in the morning just to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the move to cartoons as "a heavy joke."
“There is a government regulation that regulates the content that is broadcast from 6 a.m. onwards and this was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the little pig, yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they would modify the show to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
“When I think about the option of retransmission, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn’t do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the schedule was changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can promise that next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally have done. We tried to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we passed.
This is a very unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior by his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a winner.
At the age of 24, he told us he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “not everyone was like me.”
In the first Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention when talking about gay rights was to convey “hope” to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to underestimate the fact of winning the Olympics.
The regular host of this mythical show, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who showed himself as an outcast, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked boys and girls."
He said, “Until today, that sense of inferiority and being different has been what really gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wasn’t disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to pass on that “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion said it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who has been with him for 20 years, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’ve lived so long since you were so young” (he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone the same age who’s gone through the same ups and downs as you.
The couple had a son in June who they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global outlook" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all the answers would have revolved around ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, no doubt, Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had London 2012 passes because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him I wasn’t going to be in the front row,” he said.
“I had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine in an Olympic Games, there was nothing better,” he said.
This fact was also what inspired him to choose his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to reverse his form if he wants to prevent it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who was playing at the event held every two years to set a record for the 12th time, was overtaken by Captain Furyk for Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has done so many times for the United States, the five-time champion of majors had to settle for cheering in a few moments and, in others, try to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best form for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough continually punches with mistaken punches.
And, if the field is no longer daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games they’ve played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, started in an impressive way, Mickelson’s match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, nor could he say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role he had today, he patted me on the back and, surrounding me with his arm, he said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I thought they would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record of most Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the last of a Ryder Cups career that has never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost and 7 equal, though Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players have loved to have it as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows leadership could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that even if you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish the others by stepping on their heels by a minimum margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You don't stop reminding yourself that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but by very little," said Bjorn, portrayed, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leading him with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal to accomplish, which is to win this trophy, and that’s all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no more and no less, than the best players in the world.
Proud of what his players have done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I wouldn’t want to overtake.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are the individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re there alone, you put your golfing skills to the test.
That’s the message you have to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it’s time to put your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
Against Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as couples, with the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both extremes in the last days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he told us when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
“We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the entire route,” Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era ships, but it won’t be done until at least next year due to faulty systems and progressively rising costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that heads the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to statements by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery annoyed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and very reduced acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
Continuing delays, however, have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) will be outdated when they start serving.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if it was sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors—half the staff that were in the former Bremen-class frigates.
The ship was also found to be overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), instead of the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in light of the recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the navy is “left without ships capable of deploying.”
The officer said the problem has gotten worse over time, because the old ships were dropped, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Anything that is found out is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide upcoming conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as Daubenton’s riverside and long-eared brown bats from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at strategic locations on the property to track bat activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to find out how often bats call and what species do it.
A report and a habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development affecting their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks from domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind,
but because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in the field, who are dedicated to conducting regular surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even opened Scotland’s first and only bat reserve in Threave State in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The property’s director, David Thompson, says it’s the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the proper habitat.
However, there are still many unknowns about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, since a breeding colony can be involuntarily destroyed and 400 females and young could be killed, which would mean annihilation of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don’t know about how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled rape allegations as “fake news” and says people “want to make themselves known” at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying him $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already amassed 142 million followers just hours after the news was published, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the report “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner says looking at the camera.
“They just want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same old story.
They want to be famous just by mentioning me, but that’s it, I can’t help it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over allegations that appear in what they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy," Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident apparently took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and that he had let that "one percent" remain.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consented to.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to reach an out-of-court settlement because she had “terrorized retaliation” and was concerned “about being humiliated in public.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is trying to annul the agreement, as she remains traumatized by the events.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has switched to Juve, a great Italian football for a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK “would regret it for a lifetime” if it lost its position as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK would notify the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its Burnaston plant near Derby would be temporarily halted.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays on customs in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s general manager at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have shown their fears about leaving the EU without a deal, particularly in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns to which automakers refer revolve around the problems that could arise in assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “just in time” mode, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union on 29 March without a deal, there could be a border disruption that, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to house the amount of material equivalent to more than a day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in such a case production would stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which sets out future relations with the EU, is “precisely calibrated to avoid such checks at border crossings.”
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to take the opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful supply chain suite.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would stop, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the Unite union at the plant, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and compelling plan outlining our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed another week” as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian election, links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Expectation whether Trump decides to fire the Deputy Attorney General or not and thereby compromise Mueller’s independence has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he himself wore to try to relegate the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, among news reports where he is said to be about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump (who at the time was at the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday on Fox News.
Asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “No date has been set, it could be this week or another could be postponed, considering everything that’s going on with the Supreme Court.
We will decide it on the fly and I will inform the press, as I usually do.”
Some journalists would refute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to grandiloquent TV journalists, though he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they brag."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
“The president conducts more Q&A sessions than any president before him,” he said, while quoting without evidence: “We’ve checked those numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option to ask the president of the United States directly, I think it's much better than doing them to me.
We’ve tried to do it many times and you’ve seen us do it many times in recent weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week in New York, the president demonstrated why he was like that, where he made a carefree and sometimes bizarre appearance to the journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of State for Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and its desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that do not depend on central power.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit in which the decisions expected this autumn were chosen were followed.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible no-deal scenario.
I know all this must be very disconcerting for you.
And it is for this very reason that I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that reinforce and improve the work of the health service, from which patients and the communities we serve benefit.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we would love to continue to count on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie was operated on after suffering a head injury last Saturday, when they lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee’s Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“He came to the band and collapsed right there,” Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for in-depth examination.
A staff member from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 in the entire season.
Foreigners will be charged a higher property transfer tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher property transfer tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised by this measure will be used to shelter the “homeless,” according to the Conservatives’ new plans.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the property transmission tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to go to the “homeless”
The additional money raised by the increase in the transfer tax on farms to foreign buyers of properties in the UK will go to aid for the “homeless”, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger and harassing voters to those with higher incomes.
The increase in the property transmission tax will be levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to incentivize government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including also the level increase that was introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not reside in the UK, causing prices to rise and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas (especially in the capital) have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of maintaining very high property prices by eagerly buying land without intending to use it and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the “shameful housing problem” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unreasonable evictions.
It also proposes granting local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my post as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become too hard for many people to achieve, and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's coach says his "primary goal" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the club from the northeast, which is currently in third place in League One (England's third league division), three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B-cap," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid and it’s something that’s always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's leader included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear when he switched to such established names at such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
"The structure and facilities of this club correspond, without a doubt, to those of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to achieve, but I could only consider that I’ve achieved my goal here when I can get the club back where it should be.”
Ross has only spent three years as a coach, after a time as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on the coaching staff of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and made St. Mirren move from being on the verge of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled referring to when he took over Alloa.
“I always thought that direction was the best thing for me, much more than playing.
It may sound weird, because it was good, I was able to make a very good living with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train and now I have managed to do it, it is the time of my adult life in which I have felt better, without a doubt.

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwave has boosted profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant earnings fell by 4.8 percent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, which compiled the figures, said: “The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have still kept the pattern of the previous month of June in July, in which pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, although restaurants have fallen even slightly more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant business activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars that serve mainly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered from the heat, albeit not as drastically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose by up to 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM’s hospitality and leisure analysts, said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home activity market.
It’s not surprising that restaurant groups are still struggling, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year is going to be especially painful in view of continued cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food operators, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide the relief they need.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pubs sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the benchmark market value.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents’ backs
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind the backs of their parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth in fake Instagram pages
News has heightened fears of sexual content being published
20% of students claimed to have a "main" account that they show their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake accounts on Instagram, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being published.
20% of the students said they had a sanitized "main" account that they showed to their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter saw a teenager encouraging others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish athletics federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of directors of the Scottish athletics federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track and field athlete and her president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who expect the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from having her on board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I like being the spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert at the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine whether I would recover or to what extent I would.
It has been exhausting, but I managed to fully recover, I had to learn to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The ad of the sacaleches where comparing mothers with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what is theoretically the “world’s first silent milkshake,” consumer technology company Elvie posted an ad inspired by a somewhat ironic music video showing mothers telling about the freedom the new milk extractor gives them.
Four real women dance in a hay-filled barn like a dance floor, along with some cows, with lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, “Order them, order them, I’m feeding their babies, order them, order them, I’m milking my wives.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created great controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all sorts of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the “horrors” of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth in order to produce milk, with the exception that they take away their babies days after giving birth," one person wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another commented: “Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was, "What a more outlandish announcement."
Others, however, defended the ad, like a woman who admitted the song was "deranging."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'm sure I'd have one.
By using the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I don't give it any more thought.
It’s a product genius,” a woman told us.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a breastfeeding pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The campaign concept is based on the perception that many women who pump their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is totally silent, has no cables or tubes, and discreetly fits inside the breastfeeding bra, which makes it possible for its users to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, comments: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breastfeeding pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded down the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children detained has increased considerably, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has practically remained at the usual levels, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
About 80 percent of sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In their effort to prosecute minors faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to workers at the shelters.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who do not qualify for protection will be deported as soon as possible.
According to reception workers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to flee.
Advocates say these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Screw, where signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked due to their size.
In addition, moving to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could provoke a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria Calls on US, French and Turkish ‘Occupation Forces’ to Withdraw Immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country’s war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the right conditions were in place for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in Idlib’s last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the deal had "clear deadlines" and has expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front (linked to al-Qaeda), who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, arguing that the panel’s work should be restricted “to reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, an impeachment or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “The most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!”
At the moment there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, peak-time ratings have doubled to $1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to $1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak viewing times, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed cable channels’ ratings with 3.5 million viewers for major nightly news shows.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still can’t understand,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of “Designated Survivor,” an ABC drama about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” was the response that Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families can reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information pushes the envelope when you realize you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours debating Bob Woodward’s use of “deep-backdrop” sources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment of disproportionate pride,” in The Washington Post’s words) and the implications of the scabrossings of Daniel.
As far as I’m concerned, I’ll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s partly what makes everything look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he tells us about the alternating cast of Trump’s show and his daily twists of the plot (either entering a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode if you don’t want to be left behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sheltered inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy programs back then and people were telling us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” says Fleiss.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows in tighter House of Representatives midterm elections
Not surprisingly, the influx of money is coming to Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This Pittsburg residential district, whose structure was recently redesigned, has Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a campaign funding contest between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, although it backed down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had an affable meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization administration team.
State Department officials decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of around US$140 million in 2017 for, among other matters, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that their intention was for the conference to go ahead, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and is seen by diplomats as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to treat internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next planned step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is already considerable evidence on the public record.
Mueller is also thought to be investigating the possibility that the Trump campaign worked in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to stand again before voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a bunch of conditionals, and with that I don’t suggest that Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the contest.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d’état against Hitler; all that was needed was for the West to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of butchery that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good one since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly filming the president and had speculated about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation that the FBI has requested on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position in the Supreme Court is upheld despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will find a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles at the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"We managed to get a good point, as Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game believing we could get something and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went all out and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another big European night.
I hope we can get all three points, but it will be a difficult match because they already got a good result in the previous match but, with all the public supporting us, I am sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now you notice a general atmosphere that everything will go well.
The team is fine, the guys are enjoying a lot and we are having a good training.
I’m hopeful that we can move forward, put last season behind us and achieve success.”
Fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose sleep
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be served, few people talk about this with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to look after them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to get care, as those options can be a determining factor in the cost.
Incorporate your financial advisor into the conversion, as it can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of legal battles.
Take charge of obtaining a health care power to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals fulfill their own wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a power of attorney for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just finances that are at stake: which doctors should we deal with?” asks Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned.”
A man with a rifle shot several times in Ilfracombe
A man with a rifle has been shot several times as he walked home after going out at night.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m., as a “random act.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and police have appealed to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said, and the death toll is expected to increase.
With communications blocked, assistance officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency extending along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffers frequent earthquakes.
Below, we summarize some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of major earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, a 29-year-old citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to that police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin has been decreed pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared Saturday in court, where he pleaded “definitely innocent” when asked to testify, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning she could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering in reporting a crime of domestic violence, and possessing a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he punched him in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake occurred just next to downtown Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental van to carry out a bike lane attack on Lower Manhattan’s West Side Highway last October, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily injury, according to the death penalty intent notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder with the aid of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal New York case was to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be hoisted in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense lawyers representing Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction with a life sentence with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should take care of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to “feel the warmth” of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s deputies suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK "would have left" if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided ranks has highlighted even more when a pro-stay Tories group has joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep up the compromise plan that was signed in Chequers amid attacks from Brexit supporters, their opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and “chaos.”
MP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers’ plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left already," he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I’m going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be slavish.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that we British have changed our minds and want to remain in the European Union is completely false.”
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: “I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular among our party and our activists, who are actually the ones who take to the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget Chequers and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: “Prime ministers keep their positions when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians would have to "feel the heat" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We will mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, pro-stay protesters roamed the streets of Birmingham ahead of the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group’s presentation this weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party application during the conference’s opening.
“These are the same people who tell us that they can deploy the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all possibilities of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider all possibilities of running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
Saturday’s afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.”
One arrested for the murder with a firearm of the LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that eventually caused his death,” Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a gun and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-metre-tall native of Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders deliver victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team’s orders would have an important role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the pits and let Hamilton run in the group queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes pulled out a lap later and put himself behind Vettel, but Hamilton came out ahead after a near-sticky wheel action that made the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at the risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and placed seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race while clinging to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he pitted on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace on the remaining eight laps as he regained fourth place in Raikkonen.
It’s been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman letting me through.
The team has done exceptional work to get a perfect match," Hamilton said.
That's really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she failed to leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what happened in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, disgusting and false.”
“The only thing that could happen and the good that’s happening these last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false,” he said.
"When you read the posts and the leaks, and then they say, 'But I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
Have we leaked...? No, we haven't leaked it," he added as he mimicked the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.”
But his refusal didn’t seem to sit well with the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented, “I’ll tell you one thing: that’s been really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired their Elite League loss on Friday to the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had a two-goal lead thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the home draw before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his win.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively opening period, Sullivan put the home team back on track to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to equal the game in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched the match with a golazo in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and secured victory with their team's fifth goal as the end drew near.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane from the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to scour the area and many find themselves trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his companions fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu control tower, which was being hit by a heavy rocking.
He stood firm to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken to hear this,” he added.
The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many corpses under the ruins and many people have not been contacted," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors as much as possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has gone missing, after saying the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be noticed.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the airstrip.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
“That’s an extremely good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through water reaching their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors doing dock improvement work nearby also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Aviation safety network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
Analyst presents chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended its arguments Saturday at a new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the cell phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting his earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s van that night, Sanford said he was “lieing, because my van was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records indicated they met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to fall into the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop departed from its origins in political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Performers like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a "racist" text
A New York nanny is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies that he is racist and compares the lawsuit to an “extortion” case.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay at discovering that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her mess, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice saying her previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a lousy job and was instead expecting a Filipina, the New York Post reported.
Maurice was paid for the day’s work and sent home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving compensation of $350 a day for the six-month position of internal work for which he had been hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that things are not done that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they are racist by saying that Maurice’s termination of employment was most reasonable, as they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
“My wife had sent him something he didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the lawsuit as an “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that she was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to go for someone that way?
That’s not a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington Editors Worried Readers Wouldn't Identify with a Talking Bear, New Letter Reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It was hard to put yourself in the place of someone who was reading it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had previously worked as a cameraman for the BBC and was inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, was confident that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," added that her father was very proud of her ultimate success.
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t like to brag,” he said.
But since Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost like you had a son who accomplished something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that the situation was really bad, that he wasn’t expected to make it,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were slowly running out and leaving his system.
She had died before time and everything was going out.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not howl, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, strangers to the terrible experience that was going on.
“No one knew,” he said.
"I bowed my head and tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Grieving Women Putting Up Cards to Prevent Suicides Is a Bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis’ son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up anywhere.”
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
You don’t sit quietly, you have to talk about it.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Davies’ friend for years, lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or anything like that,” he says.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t even look at them.”
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: “It leaves a void in the whole family.
He's left us torn apart.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought that if we could really get something like what I was requesting (a time-limited, limited-range investigation), maybe we could bring a little unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “scrambling” in the midst of a partisan shutdown.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
Its refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
Only five weeks until the midterm elections on November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President’s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's deserter numbers 'fall' with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs smugglers charge, have been key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and they are often repatriated.
North-South relations, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed broadly to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances we will by no means be the first to disarm unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says he's unfit to serve on Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a “hysteric” and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she’s a hysteric,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh used the excitement to deny allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
On the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the allegations against him “grotesque and clearly coordinated smears” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because he showed his bias against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll just say one thing: if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won’t be fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, you won’t even be fit to be on the court where you are now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to feel like everything is fine,” Pelosi said.
And women have to wield it.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of fury overflowing, and she can't let it go without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's that weird, do I?"
She went on to say: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive in a company and who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
“No, I’m angry.”
And then I went on with what I was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are basically not understood well.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once when I found myself crying with inexpressible anger. An older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down a staircase.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he told me.
“They have no idea you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they think you’ve been cornered.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado Democratic congresswoman, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which she had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with no reason not to explore the idea of her running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-meaning decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
“Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was already very advanced, he lagged behind in fundraising, so it was promised that he would not re-enter the race unless he raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she delivered her speech announcing that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on attracting voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism) that she choked.
"The logical thing would have been to think he had had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said, recalling the reaction from the press.
“You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you going to put on my tombstone?
“He cried?”
U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvoes of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle still has a long way to go, a rift between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by putting tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in goods, taxing half of goods entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has retaliated equivalently, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the U.S. attacks, and the world’s second-most powerful economy is unlikely to loosen soon.
Getting Washington to back down would mean yielding to demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, pressures from the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause the conditions to start a plummeting economy in either country is actually much more dangerous than viewers have acknowledged so far,” said Abigail Grace, associate researcher focused on Asia issues for the Center for New American Security’s strategic cabinet.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the refugees’ voluntary return and calls for help to rebuild a country ravaged by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions were improving.
“The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normalcy.
The conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that had affected their daily lives and livelihoods were already met.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country and in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the North American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris, France.
The United States now has six consecutive losses on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water in hole 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to have never scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament’s current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 against the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spain’s Sergio Garcia, a veteran who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most tournament wins of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a really tough year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to get the cup back.
It is an achievement of the whole team and I am very happy to have been able to help," said one excited García after the European team's victory.
He now passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles match on Sunday.
“I feel an incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, as I’ve grown up seeing this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, lagging only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m very proud of these guys, they’ve never stopped fighting.
There was a time this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we ruined it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have made a very good game.
We’ll regroup, I’ll meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we’ll move on.
I love these 12 guys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it's up to us to tilt our heads.
They overcame us.”
