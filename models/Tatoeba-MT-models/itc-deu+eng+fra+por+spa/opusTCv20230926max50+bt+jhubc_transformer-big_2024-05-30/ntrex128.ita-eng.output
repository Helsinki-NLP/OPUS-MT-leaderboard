The members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned about "making the figure of clowns"
Some members of the Assembly are dismayed by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal arose as a result of the plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the entire political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party is concerned that "it may rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means dumb and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the group as a whole was "unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed to be "open" to the name change, but pointed out that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet (clown).
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The committee of the assembly, which is currently drafting the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what the members of the assembly will be called will of course be a topic of debate for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 granted the Welsh assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which was widely supported by the possibility of calling the Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the title of the members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option received greater consensus in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could prove to be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls for the referendum on the change of the country's name
On Sunday voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an effort to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territories and has repeatedly opposed its requests for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the result of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shut as Harlem churches are in trouble
“The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"Today there is neither of them."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people frequent regularly."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the estates will not last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will go back to where they started.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who won’t help the neighborhood’s remaining shrines.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he says, “and for that reason they will hasten the time when these churches will close altogether because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by brotherhoods before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin’s was acquired by a black congregation headed by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem’s main shopping streets, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners were planning its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first music box in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger music box at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin’s in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by lay leaders of the church, others from the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns that the diocese "tried to unload the costs" on the parish assembly although the latter had not been involved in the hiring of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old in California Lobster Fishing Dive
Official sources say a shark on Saturday attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California, during the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swam up to him along with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster but then "he realized the boy was screaming 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His entire collarbone was torn," he said he noticed Hammel once he reached the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Capt. Larry Giles said in a statement to the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the area, but that it had been declared not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper chest area.
Authorities have barred access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to push the UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with dedicated department store beauty lanes assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the major push to the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and household goods sectors decline, the largest aisles dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and adopted in more stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are hunting for new ways to use shelf space once dedicated to TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its beauty product offering to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are vegan – a quality increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will experience licensing at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food on a daily basis at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to put more effort into convincing people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said retail outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist discounters like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitats since it bought the two chains about two years ago, and that strategy has spurred food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to give back enamel to its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the splitting of revenue from pharmaceutical outlets into supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look of our beauty departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and the inviting environment and comfortable locations make us an attractive destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby walks out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her trendy brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer has time for his Truly homeware and accessories brand.
The couple's activity had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host turned to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious after retiring from their lucrative last-minute trendy brand business to focus on her new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was “furious” when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her trading empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts — worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — didn’t leave her enough time to dedicate herself to their Truly brand of household items and accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and it was estimated that it would double Willoughby's assets, estimated at around <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As soon as 37-year-old Willoughby chose Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his holiday residences.
According to one source: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would set her up for the next twenty years.
His decision to leave left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow Headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that leaving the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays to the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby conceived Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples were spending the holidays together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a guest on ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night that he "does not wish to comment on his business affairs."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would judge “non-presidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "newscaster".
"I haven't given up on anything."
He pointed out that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearisation are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not observed an “equivalent response” from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at keeping pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
“With North Korea we are doing very well,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: ending missile tests, contributing to the release of hostages, and repatriating the last U.S. military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s simple to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded camp, we would have about 200 people right in front of us,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, causing hundreds of deaths
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were notified that they were unnecessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, an essential requirement for activating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it's a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid.
Considering the earthquakes that Indonesia is continually subjected to, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common facility on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, although the alarm was given, probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading for Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put the improvement of Indonesia’s shattered infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and poured money onto roads and railroads.
But funding shortages hit the Joko administration as it prepares for re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the more conservative branch of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands driven from their homes by street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool draws against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a point in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he stood about 25 meters from Chelsea's goal, with his team down 1-0.
He touched the left ball before pulling on the second pole.
The attempt went high over the door frame as it turned to the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga and sacked into the net.
"It was just trying to get in position, to get to the ball and players like Shaq are always playing as far forward as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I gave him a touch and I didn't think too much and I pulled."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first half after the goal in the 25th minute scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blue midfielder passed Mateo Kovacic in the heel before splashing away near the midfield and shooting in the Liverpool midfield.
Kovacic made a quick pass midfield.
So he made a beautiful pass that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and finished second with a left-handed goal over Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country’s disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Numerous people have been reported trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck the country on Friday and generated waves up to 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho spokesperson told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, has been dotted with debris from collapsed buildings.

I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, to contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location of the find this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police said they are currently informing the victim’s family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.

Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "rewriting history"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many of England’s religious and cultural objects by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick's proposal a "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in light of the current debate about removing the statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressures, in his case of course of the monarchy.
That it is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century defined the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure who represents a part of such a fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig killer tears Chinese farmer to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a piglet at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs at a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby piglet was open.
He claimed that in the piglet was a large male pig with blood on the muzzle.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had torn the farmer apart, according to the statements.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and smashed,” said the cousin identified with the surname “Wu,” as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people, while police collected evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer’s death.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst.”
“They just want to play.
They are playful, very curious .... they do not want to hurt.
Just show them the right amount of respect,” he explained.
The aftermath of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the US
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains over northern Mexico and the southwestern coast of the U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds of up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5 o’clock ET on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a sack is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward towards the west coast of the USA. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push a strong tropical moisture northward, in the southwestern part of the USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during the day on Monday.
Thus, tropical moisture in contact with the approaching burst will create heavy and extensive rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
At the local level, 2 to 10 cm of rainfall can cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour in some places, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2.5-10 cm of rain is expected in some areas of the southwest, particularly over much of Arizona.
It is possible that sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions will occur due to the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could make river canyons flood and thunderstorms will bring windy puffs and lift dust.
The approaching burst will cause heavy local rainfall on part of the southern California coast.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery tracks.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona toward the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more extensive at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rains will descend on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong fluctuations in temperatures over the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature variations over short distances.
An exceptional example of significant temperature differences in the central U.S. will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the residual heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm beginning of October is expected for most of the central and eastern USA, with 26°C from the Southern Plains to the northeastern areas.
In New York, it could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, a temperature about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate strong odds of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks Thursday the captivating deposition by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that would have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute turn on Friday: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Committee that she is 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to strip her off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, during an infamous deposition, said he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the viewers who follow the shows in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, this is an audience similar to that for a football playoff game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was shot by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning as he was insulted by demonstrators as he tried to take an elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He remained with his eyes low for several minutes as he was reprimanded and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think I'm telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have the power while many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued the statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have other things to say during the commission hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh’s nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do so only with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the allegations against the candidate over the next week, as requested by minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'making policy' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans of letting the European Union "politicalize" Britain's future and jeopardize national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside that with the prime minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers Brexit deal, stating that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect their respective tariffs is “absolutely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Suspect for Death of LSU Player Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpsons, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson’s DNA on them, CBS-affiliated television station WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
The East Baton Rouge coroner’s office issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department acknowledged the merit of the Louisiana State Police Fugitives Task Force, the Police Science Laboratory, Southern University Police and local citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The LSU athletic director thanked the area law enforcement for their commitment and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198-cm striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "under shock" by Wayde's death.
“This is what you care about at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano sprinkles ash Mexico City
The ash that comes out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity had increased in the crater and there had been 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center was checking for the various rumbles and shakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash lining the windshields of cars in Mexico City’s Xochimilco neighborhood.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano that lies 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police anti-riot teams and thousands joined demonstrations by opponents to mark the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists hampered by riot police targeted police with eggs and dusted paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that usually overflow with tourists.
There were further clashes during the day with policemen who resorted to batons to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of separatists who chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" confronted the Unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
Tensions remain high in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
Voters had voted overwhelmingly for independence, although turnout was low, and Catalans opposed secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the referendum that was taking place at polling stations across the region with violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife and said he had no hopes about the possibility of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for the chance to vote, but now everything is blocked,” she explained.
Despite a key, albeit measurable, victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of the movement’s best-known leaders finding themselves in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest with his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will run in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Presenting myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after ramming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at approximately 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit with a crossbow at some point.
Menga's attack marks Livingston's 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston was a victory
The already promoted Livingston left the Rangers amazed by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as club director of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference as Gary Holt's team moved into the second division with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is therefore without a win away from home in the Premiership this season and will face next Sunday the first in the ranking Hearts, from which they separate 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continue their winning streak in the division by remaining undefeated for six games, with coach Holt still to see a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
The Livingston wastes opportunity against incisive guests
Holt’s team should have been ahead well before the goal, with their immediacy causing the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow could only kick out of the door after entering to meet Craig Halkett's header on the other side of the door.
Guests contented themselves with letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could put visitors in trouble with placed kicks.
And that’s how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass Menga, who could score from the center of the area.
Until that moment, the Rangers had dominated in possession of the ball but the defense of the host team had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This pattern was maintained during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow made a shot out of another Livingston play scheme.
The crosses followed each other in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two penalties, after Halkett's clash with substitute Glenn Middleton and one for a foul, were turned down.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their style of play and collaborators have changed very little since their return to the top series, but you have to give a lot of credit to Holt for the way he has been able to stimulate the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a masterfully organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performance in some moments with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below those standards.
The last pass was missed - only once they managed to penetrate the opposing area - and it can be considered a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan receives mixed reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at extending relations between NATO allies.
They clashed over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police have justified the intervention with security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including many Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests mirror the dissent provoked by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks of Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeastern area of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The crash came months after another cyclist died, hit by a street pirate on Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident occurred on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured During Disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a disorder at the men's maximum security prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at the Long Lartin High Security Men's Prison in Worcestershire at approximately 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized agents "Tornado" were employed to manage the riot, which involves eight inmates and which is confined to a prison wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to contain an ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison.”
The Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment following the attack by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called in to intervene in the prison to quell a violent riot in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which could benefit drought-affected areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when the last energies of Hurricane Rosa sweep across the desert’s southwest, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The national weather service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday across western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix tweeted that only “ten tropical cyclones have kept the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center’s latest models predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the southwest, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will receive 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with isolated peaks of up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be positive as the southwest is currently going through a period of drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
Initially the route of Hurricane Rosa will reach the mainland through the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who was still maintaining hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds at a top speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the colder waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
Rainfall on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation is expected between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a tropical depression state, then head through Arizona and toward southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or her aftershocks are heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the U.S.," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Such rains are expected to generate sudden, potentially lethal flooding and debris flows into the deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Assault: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys to a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Authorities have appealed to anyone who may have captured what happened on the phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered from the badness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered from the badness and anger” of the Democratic Party during the entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, passionately and decisively denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual assault against her decades ago, when she was still a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing defending himself against the prosecution.
The president said Saturday that "the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a jurist with an unspeakable record in public service,” he said in front of a mob of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment by talking about the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
"Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m really busy,” he said.
"For this fight strenuously for exceptional candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are committing to “resist and hinder.”
The first critical procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to GOP management told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by giant waves hitting beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) high hit the beach at dusk, sweeping away numerous people killing them and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, thus turning into victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster control agency BNPB.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit anything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved to the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed numerous buildings and shops destroyed, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have boosted the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “extended” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications “have been totally paralyzed, with no information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alarm was sounded.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man on an upper floor of a building shouting agitated way to warn of the incoming tsunami people in the street below.
A few minutes later a wall of water fell on the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
According to authorities, the army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for rescue and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's awful.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where employees took refuge under tarpaulin shelters in their office yard, they encountered scenes of devastation on the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's awful.
Even as rescue teams began the difficult start-up of rescue gears, there were some complaints that foreign rescue workers with extensive knowledge were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations state that funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And that has not yet happened.
"This is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the missing still held hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles alleviating the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was pulled out of a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran in the paragliding industry, I’m carrying my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were attending the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single gray tick instead of two blue ticks.
“I think it means the messages haven’t been delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 During ATM Supply in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying an ATM at the entertainment center and preparing to deliver more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man “showed up behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag with the money for delivery.
Witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information regarding the identities of the offenders is invited to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
In announcing Saturday's name change on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change came before his participation at Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande in the show, who has cancelled her participation for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains for him a religious meaning.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We’ve gone from Kanye, which means the one, to simply Ye – the reflection of our goodness, our badness, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are.”
He is just one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed the name with or without hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed not to use the military against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use the army to repress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers had fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were gaining ground across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by granting monthly student subsidies and opening more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of training opportunities push young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its research funding in this field, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements by various U.S. government groups regarding AI, although in the U.S. there is generally a lack of a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its program last year: it aims to be the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double the budget in AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we need a new revolution in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big success in the AI industry will be achieved in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that defeated the American Othello player with the highest score and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese section.
Lee recalled previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one will be held, in order to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders, it’s the multinationals,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired luminaries from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically offered to AI graduates,” he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its program for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. order to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been silent for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on a possible change of the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would settle the decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbors constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments struck a deal in June under the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would damage the ethnic identity of the majority-Slavic Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts about the possibility that the turnout will reach the minimum of 50% necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "You agree with NATO and EU membership and acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is the price to pay for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of former Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will respect the result of the vote to make it final.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters had cast their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and arranging the chairs in front of the curtains set up by those who want to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go headlong, not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – a percentage below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia, indicated that 57% of respondents planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores a goal avoiding Brighton's entire defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defense during the 2-0 win from Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his point in the 65th minute seem extremely easy.
The Argentine striker received a halfway pass at the start of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting himself onto the free field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated one defender before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
He then made a passage to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-shoot in the net.
"Aguero is having problems with his foot," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about letting him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he managed to score at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in depth on the pitch of Brighton.
He sent a nice filter ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues striker threw the ball into the net just before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But the as-yet-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who keep a head start on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies scored at least one repechage with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to win their first division title.
“Even if we play aimlessly, at least we can be able to pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level of all this year.
Why shouldn’t I want to race?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a first pitcher for Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to let Scherzer pitch in such situations.
Scherzer, who would be first pitcher for the 34th time, on Thursday performed a pitching session and would be first pitcher on his normal resting Sunday.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings for this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he talked about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we did was put into play in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really working for it, and I'm fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “We see this horrible group of radical Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using any necessary means, you can see evil, meanness.
They don’t care who they can hit, who they have to overwhelm in order to regain power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control and we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of “resisting and hindering.”
“And we’ve been able to see it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, mean, mean, and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Justice Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, triggering loud whistles among the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, um, no, I'm waiting for one -- that was bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
Doesn't tolerate people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a big surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, and all because they said what they thought.
My fellow Member Joan Ryan has received similar treatment because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all arguments similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the local Labour Party parliament, Friday night meetings were exactly like that.
However, this is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a "kinder and more courteous" policy has long since been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to party leadership or not.
This all started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a similar political vision began to expect a trend reversal from me and that I would take positions that I would never accept, whether it was national security or the European single market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – they follow invectives of insults on social media that demand my withdrawal, denouncing the politics of the center and telling me that I shouldn’t be part of the Labour party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insult levels.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party shrinks.
In the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would have gone well".
But that’s not what I got into politics for.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government's negligence that had left my secondary school class literally to fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way bewildered by my political stances and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of what I consider to be your best interests.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr climbs the leaderboard
Two late attempts may have somehow unbalanced the final result, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun game of Tennent’s championship day.
They are now at the top of the rankings, the only team to be beaten out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” said the coach.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “You have to acknowledge Ayr’s merit, they’ve taken better advantage of the opportunities than we have.”
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought Ayr into the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted goal.
Climo increased the distance of the Ayr with a penalty before, right in halftime, to score and then convert a goal alone to bring the Ayr to 17-5 in the interval.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s goal, converted from Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long hiatus due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was laid down, and at restart, the Ayr jumped back to the lead thanks to a goal from Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr substitute captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose charged the extra man with an unconverted goal from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of heavy pressure.
The home team was back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for a ballless, strike-out Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr's advancing scrum.
Climo converted, as he had done almost since the restart, after Rowe had picked up the kick from David Armstrong's area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to look for the home team's fifth goal.
Star of Still Game looking for a new career in the catering industry
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, has decided to switch to the hotel industry after discovering he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he co-writes and co-stars with longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final series of the show and it seems Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to lists of official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to make statements, though a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “thriving catering business.”
''The sea is ours'': landlocked Bolivia hopes a court will reopen path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a naval headquarters lined with hardware in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coastline and now in the hands of Chile after a bloody 19th-century conflict over resources is still alive, as is the desire to once again cross the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and obviously is waiting for the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on big screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Hague court will welcome Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of intermittent dialogue – Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia an outlet on the sea of State competence.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who is facing a controversial battle for reelection next year - has a lot at stake with Monday's ruling.
“We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory and has specified that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final pleadings indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale’s belligerent rhetoric has shattered any remaining good intentions of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to continue the discussions following what happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was particularly expeditious.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able to "enjoy extraordinary opportunity in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he explained.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political scam.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen without U.S. confidence
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation will never disarm nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington first.
Mr Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to stick to the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears intent on restarting stalled diplomatic talks after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an “illusion” that continued US sanctions and opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War could ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of issuing the declaration without Pyongyang first carrying out important disarmament actions.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is willing to give up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows feature the latest trend in huge headdresses that will soon be in a high fashion store near you
If you want to expand your headdress collection or completely block the sun’s rays, look no further.
Stylists Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the runways a series of crazy oversized headdresses for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have made furore on Instagram this summer and these stylists have sent their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a broad feather-like edge that submerged the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer’s hat, and even a pineapple – but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have stitched lips and look more like a Hannibal Lecter representation than a haute couture one.
One creation looked like a diving suit with mask and goggles, while another looked like a loose ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the huge statements of style, you are lucky.
Observers of the style predict that the huge caps could come to you in the high fashion streets.
The outsize hats come in the wake of "The Bomb," the one-meter-wide straw hat that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that has invaded social media has sent another huge creation onto the catwalk: a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in costume wearing it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera's spring-summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I anticipate that these big hats and beach bags will arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the stylist got such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish Independent Schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective endeavors.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aspire to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further higher education, for their chosen careers and for their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector able to develop and adopt a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and in-demand subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will reach the heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships of trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of pupils who studied foreign languages obtained the highest grades.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students obtained the highest praise rating in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish obtained the highest rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as key skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, technique and mathematics) in the curricula of independent institutes and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons employees indicated for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
This is why language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language proficiency, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language teaching is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a viable job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking to 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, with teacher staff specializing in that area.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever their future may be.
There is no denying right now, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to be determined for how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“At this point in my career I don’t need friendly matches to prepare,” he said.
The time of the gathering a West Virginia of Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia to a flurry of rallies.
This is the first of five gatherings planned for Trump next week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending for his choice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time will Trump’s rally be and how can you follow him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become strained over allegations of sexual assault with an early Senate confirmation vote pending for a week while the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November election get a little push.
So, President Trump’s campaign said these five gatherings over the course of the next week are aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so critical to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign’s busiest season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the rally tonight could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in the queue in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows the courage to fight to keep the hopes alive until the singles on Sunday
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing pendulum motion is a totally invented sports concept in which players firmly believe and never like in races like these.
Where is the movement now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I'd say we're keeping a little bit of the bike," Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
The Americans feel they have a bit of a wind in their favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three points out of four.
Spieth has been ruthless from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural screams of celebration grew louder as the game went on, sinking a crucial putt to tie the scores at Game Four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt that made them win the game at the 15th hole was greeted with a similar scream, which tells you that he believes the American team is not out of the race yet.
“You really have to put a lot of effort into worrying about your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the irrefutable version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four by four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the noisy crowd consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there would be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
However, European speeches of glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon joined Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could not even come up.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and don’t give, and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained an important lead in the final day but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup after ending Saturday’s fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score so far to four-point Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, in an attempt to retain the trophy lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an uneven American team in the morning fourballs, winning 3-1.
The U.S. held out the most in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to catch up.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 singles games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a downed Woods and newcomer American Bryson Dechambeau with an even sharper 5&4.
Woods, who crawled for two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned alongside partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the results expected on a pleasant and windy day south-west of Paris.
Three-time big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a bold 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in fourball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point gap passing to the individual, although as a starter, Furyk's team only needs a draw to defend the trophy.
After being the best seconds for two days, however, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea Absolutely Refuses Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that maintaining sanctions was exacerbating the country's distrust of the United States, which in such circumstances would absolutely refuse to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the world body's General Assembly that North Korea has taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see any consistent response from the US,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no security in our national security, and in such circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm unilaterally first.”
Although Mr Ri reused the well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearisation with which North Korea would be rewarded on the basis of gradual action, his statement was important because he did not entirely reject unilateral denuclearisation as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first ever meeting between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The US insists on the need to ‘have denuclearisation first’ and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner and even opposes the ‘declaration of an end to the war’,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion of those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions is increasing our distrust.”
Ri made no reference to plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader had announced at the U.N. earlier this week.
The minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the counterpart to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this standstill.”
But even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year’s speech at the UN General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to target US territory with North Korea’s missiles after “the evil president” Trump had called Kim a “missile man” engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking the path of disarmament, but said much more needs to be done and that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a deadline, stating that “whether it’s going to take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Compliance with the Security Council sanctions must continue with force and without exception until complete, final and ascertained denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously backed sanctions controlling North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea already three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of having filed “gangster requests.”
North Korea pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the U.S. took “compliant measures.”
He said Kim had explained to him that the “compliant measures” he wanted were security guarantees to which Trump had committed himself in Singapore and actions towards a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all its students to sleep more in an attempt to counter the growing manly culture of studying for whole nights powered by caffeine.
One university scholar has found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea of the basic concepts of caring for oneself.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He had the idea to start the course after a lecture he had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“At last a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now, when I’m in my senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me a lot,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is the image of a dorm room, where students can select coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride tied to the “white night to study” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students lead to lack of sleep being a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the students' secret weapon to combat stress, fatigue, anxiety, explained and even should serve to avoid gaining weight since lack of sleep brings the brain into starvation mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the faculty of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after taking one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar program of study before enrolling at this competitive institute.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for when they need to go to bed, as well as when they need to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another out-of-home depression attack with Dolly Menga’s goal relegating Steven Gerrard’s disjointed squad to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking for their first away win since their February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 coaching games leaving his team eight points behind escaped Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired Rangers line-up never seemed to be able to tie.
While the Ranger now descends to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, and only behind the Hibernian for difference in goals.
And there could be additional issues coming up for the Rangers after line guard Calum Spence was treated for a head injury due to an object apparently thrown from the outside of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly overtook Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual lineup that tore a point at Hearts last week and would be pleased with the way his well-prepared team choked their opponents on each lap.
The Rangers may have dominated for possession of the ball but the Livingston made better use of the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just two minutes later when Menga's first-half pass sent Scott Pittman forward to Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A deep penalty kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense mate Alan Lithgow could only pull to the side on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than conviction in their play in the penalty area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to be given a penalty at the end of the fifteenth as a result of a clash with Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers only managed to shoot twice on goal in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a soft shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even just for his commitment.
Once again, the Rangers failed to manage a deep-seated kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn’t react when Declan Gallagher leaked the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the shift had an almost immediate impact as the wing threw a ball into Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself off the goal line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased the detachment in the final stages, but McGregor objected to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton lodged a last-ditch request after a cross with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanacco: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTAGE continues... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those believable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these earphones you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Say a little it's just exploding right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to numerous types of cancer and are then reinjected
An experimental trial of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so that they can “see” a protein common to numerous cancers, called HER2, and then those cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein “promotes the growth of different types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar procedure of extracting immune cells from patients to “teach” them how to target cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West throws himself into a pro-Trump diatribe wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was whistled in the studio during a Saturday Night Live episode after a disjointed performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing her third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which she wore a MAGA cap, she began a rage against the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How you like Trump, he’s a racist!’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began the show with a screenplay starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee against allegations of sexual assault filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of the West Phillips was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear if Rock was trying to tease West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time backstage because of his headscarf.
"They bullied me backstage.
They told me, ‘Don’t go out with that cap on.’
They bullied me!
And so they told me I’m an outcast,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken place?" and said, "I would wear the Superman cloak because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want the world to move on?
Try the love."
His comments generated whistles at least twice from the audience and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with one person telling the newspaper: "A deadly silence has fallen on the study."
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many with a performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR KEEPING THE HEAD TO THE MASS."
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "what he is and that's just wonderful."
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying their music or their clothes or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is embracing a vomiting ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so we are," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Friend rapper Snoop Dogg called himself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased musical legend Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and thus the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder by stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is due to appear in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such screen soils often make boys believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt “something went wrong” and thought about how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old co-star of Game of Thrones, admitted to worrying about the issue.
“Personally I’m worried, very much at the moment – what was our mistake with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we taught men as they grew up in terms of the problem we are looking at now?”
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that makes kids think they have to be in this particular way of being a man?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time – how can we change things?
Because obviously something went wrong with the young people.”
During the interview he also admitted that he will not play any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones once the series ends next summer, stating that he "has ended up with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s True West revival, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor has recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife during this series, so she gave me my future family, and my life from now on,” he explained.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow, the character of Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported already in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country’s traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are caused by inadequate protections during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to addressing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators’ data, and speaks of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
The congresswoman denounced Saturday allegations against a member of her staff regarding the publication of personal information of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were fomented by opinionists and "ultra-right wing" websites.
“Lies, lies and still despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday, released by an anonymous Capitol official during an expert panel hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released information related to a Waters staff member.
"This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were jeopardized as a result of these false and biased allegations, was in no way responsible for the leakage of such information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ claim quickly sparked online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
You don't have to question the accuser's reasons.
You have to stay calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by detractors of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to oust Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Enormous if confirmed," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office alerted “competent authorities and law enforcement agencies to these biased claims.
"We will ensure that those responsible are unmasked," he continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their dangerous and harmful actions to all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English strikes again - the spy parody with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has now become customary to search for references to Brexit in every new film with a British twist and that seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English’s action comedy, which began in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English – The Rebirth.
The veiled self-irony on the theme of how crappy we do will be the new export opportunity of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent rubber-faced Johnny English with eyes out of orbit has gotten his license to mess things up for the second time — and his name indicates more than anything that it’s a comedy creation developed for non-English-speaking movie-going countries.
Obviously it is the silly secret agent who despite his strange claims of glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind that contributed with a single note to the theme moments of Glory of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard, which left chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers briefly rattle against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but the humor seems pretty undersized and oddly unnecessary, especially now that "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems aimed at children rather than adults and to me Johnny English’s crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson’s silent films when he plays Mr. Bean.
The immutable premise now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A hacker has infiltrated the top-secret web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent in charge, a role unfortunately very small for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that overflows the vase for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this character similar to Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the script.
Your intelligence advisers inform you that every single active spy has been compromised and that you will have to recall someone who has already retired.
And this means that the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a school executive in a chic establishment, but who also gives informal lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a School of Rock type of espionage course.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his ailing former partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin of the Disasters for Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling into the network of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by smuggling into Volta's luxury yacht and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as polite and exuberant as it is, there is a lot of children's TV throughout the story.
The whole thing is quite modest.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Couldn’t the British film industry assign Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is working out a plan so that the British can work four days a week but get paid for five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, while being paid for five.
The party would like business leaders to transfer savings from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
Employees could enjoy a three-day weekend while maintaining the same pay.
Some sources said the idea would be compatible with the party's economic program and plans to tip the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day day was endorsed by the union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the evolving economy.
A senior member of the Labour party told The Sunday Times: “By the end of the year it is expected that a revision of the policy line will be announced.”
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
In any case, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not part of the party’s political line and is not currently the subject of discussion.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless leaders” and “speculators” in enterprises for public services.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also imply that the current shareholders of the water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour government could implement “deductions” on the basis of behavior considered illegal.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create inclusive equity funds, so as to transfer 10 percent of the private sector companies’ net worth to employees, who end up putting in their pockets annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises questions about whether the agency’s findings could influence any of the Republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview to air on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it was possible for the FBI to bring something to light that could induce them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said that as I was going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what had happened, that that accusation had come out, I said, ‘Did you do it?’
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s vow, however, seems carved into the rock.
“I have a clear idea about Brett Kavanaugh and they could resist a bomb-proof accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has vigorously denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you nominate couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that sees the performance of a remarkable run of stars and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
In its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pour onto Central Park’s Great Lawn not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real purpose, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant way that would help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But, precisely, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that 12 years remain to achieve its intended purpose?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another example of so-called clicktivism—people who feel like they’re really making a difference simply by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters for a variety of purposes.
These actions have helped urge world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their shares, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that protected capital funds have so far had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor-executive partnership committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children were put in place, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on their website, which asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and arduous journey – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of those who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to implement “a blockade” and hinder Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its own navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russian involvement in Syria – particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe,” he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to cope with it.
“The United States has the ability, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not put on the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to respondents at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “poorly versatile,” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration was involved in a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, which for European consumers is absolutely the cheapest option.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to double the capacity of the pre-existing one to 110 billion cubic meters, is a project of a purely economic nature.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said, following a meeting held in September in Moscow with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Energy.
The US stance triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I see it as a big problem that a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to ‘Seriously Consider’ Candidate for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren on Saturday said she would "seriously consider" running for president following the midterm elections.
At a city assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our ugly government, and that means having a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
During the city assembly Warren said his on President Donald Trump, declaring that he was “taking this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, whom he appointed to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “It’s natural that there is a need for an FBI investigation before the vote.”
A poll released Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run in 2020.
58% of “likely” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent supported such a candidacy.
The poll found greater support for a candidacy by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of high-profile Democrats that have been discussed about a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump's Gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence case on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through after he’s back, I can relate to other families experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have dedicated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship for domestic violence and possession of a narcotic gun, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Columbia Support the Challenge for New Asylum Policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are advocating a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus curiae brief in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner “and her violent gang members’ children” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was put under arrest in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing rampant gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals to apply for asylum to undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, District Attorney Karl Racine said the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of the particular circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates that principle,” the amicus curiae memorandum states.
The prosecutors also objected that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the United States is damaging the U.S. economy, stating the clear likelihood that they will become entrepreneurs and “provide needed labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is accessible to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fears due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Nursing homes were never designed to alleviate every problem -- even every serious problem -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu as death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her feverish little baby at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"At every moment there is an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, digging through their cool belongings, in an attempt to retrieve whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a shoulder and back fracture, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the continued strong shocks of settling.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recounted the sensation of the violent earthquake shaking the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
“I was crushed in the rubble of the wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Making Arrogance’ with ‘Propaganda’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper advertising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press for propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to an announcement paid for by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation that China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election highlighted what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase of an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war that has seen them adapt their tariffs to their respective imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and U.S. experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, “now ramps up those arrogances by publishing advertising on our free newspapers.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of free speech and press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"Conversely, in the newsstand on the road here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissent and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese population might have on China's problematic economic trajectory, given that the media are under the firm fist of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most distinguished newspapers evaded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans Are Alienating Female Electorate Before Midterm Elections With Kavanaugh Case, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans stand up for Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court and stand on his side in dealing with various sexual harassment charges, analysts have signaled that there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
"You can't take these things down," Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for a paper published Saturday.
Reeher said she doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it either tomorrow or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan “November is coming!” during their protest in the Senate Hall, when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is skyrocketing,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they were already tall; it’s true.
But they could be higher, especially among the indecisive electricians in the suburbs and young voters, between 18 and 29, who often don’t vote despite not liking the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which provided details of his sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had speculated that a negative reaction might occur if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
“For the GOP it has become a confusing whole,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it’s also about the way Republicans have handled the situation and the way they have handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to believe following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents have surely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they have certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or surely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one of the other accusers, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals during a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that draws its origins from Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the underlying intent behind Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is completely up to the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to bring adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few staffed developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech programmers around the world will be able to build their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not tell "Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely shattered overnight.
“We are not asking for their permission.”
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the ecclesiastic of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, was recognized on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “magnificently symbolic” that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through thick fog, under heavy fire from the camp and war machines".
Then he hurried to the line of fire and with the "greatest gallantry" advanced the line before he ran with a single-handed cannon and landed three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never live up to and something that makes me more humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he “really felt honored to play a role in the parade” and added “the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by a lot of people.”
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, and instead caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night watching the famous Bellator 206 only to be denied the vision of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including the six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on screen.
Some remained basiled after staying awake until the early hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter, a fan described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of bad-tasting joke.”
“The government’s regulation provides that at six in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to switch to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," "yes."
“Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about the replay, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“But there it is six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it changed schedule, a lot of messages came in and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We’re going to limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally do – and we’ve tried to get so much for the fans, and we’ve just discussed it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feeling 'Inferior' Due to Sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality — but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he did not realize, until he arrived at secondary school, that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first episode of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she had made her voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, took a series of months off due to illness.
Presenting himself as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls."
He said: “Nowadays, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, were the things that really gave me the strength and energy to be successful.”
He wanted to prove himself to be “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if by chance they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and has used his face at this year’s Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man — U.S. director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “took me by surprise.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so many at a young age” — he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The two became parents in June, to a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “whole perspective” has changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about ‘I had to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted the fact that he was about to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be around here so you can be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I hadn’t realized he wasn’t invincible yet,” he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
“I just knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life – swimming in front of a home audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – Heather Small’s Proud – which had particular significance for him in preparing for the Olympics and still makes him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The out-of-form Mickelson put on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get back in shape to prevent it from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the two-year event for the twelfth time in a row, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the U.S., the five-time champion spent the day between cheering and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what torments him.
Having never been the strongest of the drivers even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the uneven course regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the course itself wasn’t daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces careful British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of their 12 single matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson’s match could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, he patted me on the shoulder, put an arm around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of self-confidence.
He’s a Hall of Famer and he’s added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn’t think I’d play two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s the way it went and that’s the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even remotely mirrored the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, though Furyk said his presence brought intangible assets to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the meeting room,” he explained.
“I also think the younger players had a lot of fun trying on him this week, which was fun to watch.
He did so much more than play.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can vanish soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable race.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 match at Valderrama in which the team, led by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point gap from the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimal advantage, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"I keep saying to myself that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but little," said Bjorn (pictured) after seeing the class of 2018 win, Friday for 5 to 3 and yesterday for 10 to 6, at Le Golf National.
“History will prove to me and my team that it’s not over.
Tomorrow you have to do your best.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It is not over until the points are marked on the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who is on the other side: the best golfers in the world.”
Happy with the way his people competed on that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have outdone myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of the individual performances, which is another thing.
It’s nice to be there with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re just your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, you have to bring out the best in you.
Then you forget about your partner because he too has to go there and bring out the best in him.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will look to his players for the best individual rather than team performance, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who collected three points out of four.
Furyk himself found himself on both sides in those big games of the final day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing to the European "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every single word," he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the lead on the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start right away as we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When the game begins to take a certain turn, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way we think appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
“I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end,” Bjorn said of his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new military ship has been postponed again
According to local media, the last frigate of the German Navy was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships from Cold War times, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and a surge in costs.
The commission of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying post-delivery issues tormented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to employ the new frigates up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its power overseas, will become obsolete when they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate Type F-125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media noted a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the ship useless when used on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half the staff of the older Bremen-class ships.
In addition, it emerged that the ship weighs decidedly too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) is also becoming an important issue.
It appears to have reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involving the new frigates are becoming of particular importance in light of the recent alarms regarding the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, parliamentary commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the Navy in fact “lacks ships capable of being employed.”
The official said the issue has worsened considerably over time, as the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research conducted on a Scottish Highland estate aims to reveal how bats use their eyes to procure food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the only extant flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow bats and soprano, as well as brown earworms and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using portable detectors.
An expert’s analysis of the recorded sounds will determine the frequency of bat calls and how each species behaves.
A habitat map and a report will then be produced to create a detailed, scaled-up picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results can reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how these are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows, and how to best maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
Bats are at risk because of the construction and development work that affects the three poles and ruins the habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can mosquito-killing paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to grabbing a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to spot insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect the trepoils and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first bat-only reserve at Threave Estate in the Dumfries and Galloway region, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says that the property is the ideal territory.
“Here at Threave we have a vast area for bats,” he said.
“We have ancient buildings, many centuries-old trees and good habitat.
But there’s a lot about bats that we don’t know yet, so the work we do here and at the other properties will help us understand more about their growth needs.”
It stresses the importance of checking bats before conducting maintenance within properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal trefoil could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their homes.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations as lawyers sue German weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to advertise” under his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese forward of Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also announced Friday the charge of paying $375,000 to keep the silence on the incident.
In an Instagram video aimed at his 142 million followers, in the hours following the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, cut off the statements as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time Ballon d'Or staring at the camera.
“They want to advertise through my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but that’s part of the game.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” the footballer added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions about the private sphere".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for “moral damages to the extent corresponding to the seriousness of the privacy violation, considered, probably, one of the most serious personal rights in recent years.”
The event took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he subjected her to anal violence, according to statements filed with the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident, saying he was "99 percent" a "good guy" disappointed by "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sexual relations, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also said she went to the police and hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation agreement as she felt "terrorized by retaliation" and worried about the prospect of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now trying to overturn the deal, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to switch to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the incident, and this summer he will join Juventus with a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK “may regret forever” the loss of its status as a world leader in car manufacturing following Brexit, Industry Minister Greg Clark said.
He also added that he was “concerned” by statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC about Britain’s eventual exit from the EU without a deal and the consequent momentary stoppage of production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” said Minister Clark.
The Japanese automaker says border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could affect jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, where the Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s general manager in Burnaston.
There is growing concern among other UK automakers about leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of the “just in time” concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and European suppliers for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border problems that would cause delays and shortages of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of inventory value at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Minister Clark says Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely thought out to avoid these border inconveniences.”
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us to enjoy not only the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop but, in the long run, warns that additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the plant’s union delegates, says the workers are deeply concerned: “Based on my experience, once jobs are cut, they are no longer reinstated.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed by a week,” as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller’s work investigating Russian interference in the election, the ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy justice minister, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a bug to record conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and was rumored to be resigning.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Wednesday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of inquiries from the FBI against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News.
Asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There hasn’t been a date set, it could be this week, I guess she’s going to postpone another week considering everything that’s going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and continue to update the press.”
Some journalists may dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Conductor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of briefings was not due to an aversion to television reporters “showing themselves,” though he said: “I don’t disagree with them showing up.”
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
“The president holds more Q&A sessions than any president before him,” he said, adding without quoting evidence: “We’ve checked the numbers.”
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
“We’re trying to do it, as we’ve done in recent weeks, and this will replace briefings with press briefings and you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown the reason by giving a free-wheeling, yet bizarre, speech in front of a group of journalists.
Health Minister writes to European workers of the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The Health Minister wrote to EU staff working at Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MEP Jeane Freeman has sent a letter less than six months in advance of the UK’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to addressing the costs of settled status applications for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: “Throughout the summer there have been continuous negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British government has also prepared itself in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of health services, giving benefits to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly wish you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie was operated on after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday’s game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31 to 27, Mike Organ of The Tennessean newspaper reported.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury occurred just before the break.
“He approached the edge of the field and passed out,” Reed said.
First aid workers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him away for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet about the type and extent of the damage" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five tackles before leaving the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to Labour’s new plans
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters
The stamp tax increase will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury plans to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp taxes for buying property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The stamp tax increase will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional resources will support the government’s initiative to combat the homeless phenomenon.
The surcharge, which adds to the current stamp tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let properties, could amount to more than 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many of the wealthiest areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp tax to help younger people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by grabbing land without using it and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up quotas on affordable housing to settle Britain’s “real estate misfortune.”
MEP Corbyn announced an egregious series of housing market reform proposals, including rent controls and the elimination of evictions without guilt.
It also wants to give the council more powers over the construction of new properties.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year I said I would be committed to re-establishing the British dream that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if buying a home was just as easy for people who do not reside in the UK and for foreign companies, as it is for resident British workers.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland technical director Jack Ross says his "maximum aspiration" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old is drawn to the challenge of lifting the Northeastern team, which is currently third in League One, three points from the top.
He landed at the Stadium of Light this summer after driving for St. Mirren during last season’s Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I've been in Serie B and that's it," Ross told the BBC's Sportsound program.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it’s something I’ll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as manager of a team.”
Ross' predecessors at the helm of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn't feel any anxiety about following such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back to the Premier League.”
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it belongs without a doubt to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I will only succeed if I can get the team back up."
Ross began his managerial career three years ago, after a stint as assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a replacement coach for the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa save himself from relegation to the third level and took St. Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than during his football career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
“I really believed that the role of manager was meant for me, rather than the role of player.
It seems strange because I worked well, made a living and had some good results.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with weekly.
I still deal with them in terms of stress and job pressure but the management seems good.
I’ve always wanted to direct, and now I do, and I feel much calmer than I’ve ever been in my life.”

According to a study, the right time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has brought more revenue to struggling British pubs and more concern to catering services.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA trade consulting firm put the data together and commented: “The persistence of the sun and England’s long stay at the World Cup meant that July followed a similar path to June, when pubs were above 2.8 percent, while restaurants were hit hardest.
The 1.8 percent collapse in the catering industry in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where most drinks were found to be the most solid, with a homogeneous increase greater than the decrease in restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered the heat, although not in an excessive way as the restaurateurs.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent in the month, while food consumption declined by three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s Recreation and Reception analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle, although a decline in sales of 4.8 percent annually will be particularly burdensome in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come in a worse period for the restaurateurs and only the weather will tell if the more moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary truce.
Global sales growth between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting declining brand roll-outs.

One in five children owns secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11, owns secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Instagram” pages
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being posted.
20 percent of students said they had a “major” account to show parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, creates social networking accounts that keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake on Instagram” accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened fears that sexually motivated content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they run a cleaned “major” account to show to parents while keeping one private.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, from the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of private schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admitted to keeping their accounts private.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘voice for athletes’ at Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected a non-executive member of the board of Scottish Athletics during the national general assembly of the administrative body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in athletics, and President Ian Beattie described the appointment as a great opportunity for sports managers to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys deep respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that in Scotland athletics could benefit enormously from bringing her on board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland.”
The American, winner of the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, and currently a BBC opinionist, found herself unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was an exhausting job but I recovered completely, he learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
The advertising of a breast pump compares mothers and cows and divides opinion online
A breast pump company has divided opinion online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers and cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is termed the “world’s first silent and wearable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie launched an ad in the form of a joking music video to show the freedom to express themselves as mothers given by the new breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, “Yes, I pull my milk but I don’t have one thing” and “If I hadn’t noticed, these are not breasts but my boobs.”
The chorus continues: "Take him out, take him out, feed the children, take him out, take him out, give my ladies milk."
However, the advertisement, posted on the company’s Facebook pages, caused controversy on the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom argued that it highlighted the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“An unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they too must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their young are stolen from them a few days after birth,” someone wrote.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly worn under a bra for moms
Someone else commented: “Comprehensibly traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who will continue to keep their babies?"
Someone else added, “It’s really nonsense advertising.”
Others defended it and a woman even admitted to finding the song "fun".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I wish I had one.
When I used the breast pump, I felt just like a cow.
Advertising is a little irreverent, but it doesn’t go very far from reality.
This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another person commented, “This is a fun advertisement dedicated to moms who use breast pumping (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like ‘cows.’”
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet breast pump tucked into the bra.
The concept the campaign is inspired by is based on the idea that many women who use breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvie breast pump is however completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be slipped into a breastfeeding bra giving women the freedom to move, hold children in their arms, and even get out while pulling milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who use the breast pump to cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast pump is able to ensure.”
This is not the first time that the breast pump Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children showed up on the catwalk of designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policy line has made it harder to keep these children.
The majority of those who took them into custody were usually illegal immigrants who now fear they could jeopardize their ability to remain in the country by offering to do so.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential trustees and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had offered to take into custody children alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who offer to take children into foster care or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we're continuing to hunt these people down," Albence said.
To try to prosecute children faster, officials have introduced new rules whereby some of them will have to appear in court within a month of their arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to those working at reception points.
Many will appear by videoconference rather than in person, to plead their case of legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who will be considered ineligible for help will be promptly expelled.
The longer children remain in foster care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent fits of anger or attempts to flee, according to those working at reception points and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Supporters of this position say that the likelihood of this happening is even higher in a large structure like that of Screw in which, precisely because of its size, it is easier for children’s distress signals to be ignored.
They add that moving children into the tent town without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland even though the war has now reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces occupy Syrian soil illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and supporting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions are favourable for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "instilling unfounded fears" that push refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
“What should only be a humanitarian problem is being politicized.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be allocated in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented an extended attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters of the al-Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, which "will be uprooted".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the group's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will win his second term
Under this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may hope, his presidency must end prematurely because of an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidency finale ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of spectators flexing.
Since 2014, the first night’s percentages have more than doubled to $1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to $1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in the opening night, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” surpassed the network’s percentages to reach 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with the most important news.
“It’s a fire that people are attracted to because it’s not something explainable,” says Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC television series Designated Survivor, which tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, “Because it makes me laugh.”
Chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television show, the storyline of Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade ruling, whether or not immigrant families will be able to reunite, and the health of the global economy.
Stopping to follow the news is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond their duty as informed citizens to find themselves following for the sixth hour in a row a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s in-depth research for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment full of treachery,” commented The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Trump’s disgusting descriptions of the parties.
I can’t watch Super Mario anymore without thinking about it.
“Part of the reason it looks like a reality show is that every night there’s news,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars,” about the alternation of actors and day-to-day developments in the plot of Trump’s show (as opposed to N.F.L. praising Kim Jong-un).

This week I went to see Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and despite it being a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in the house watching MSNBC and in the meantime recording CNN.
He failed to get away from TV, not as Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Judiciary Committee and the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented, “I remember when we once did all those absurd programs and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.’
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Influx of foreign money in the race for the tightest midterm elections
Not surprisingly, there is an influx of money in the 17th district thanks to the realignment of a congressional district that has caused two incumbents to now run for the same place.
The recent redefinition of the suburban district of Pittsburgh brings in Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is racing against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania overlapping the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that in the old districts constituencies had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race to the 17th district unleashed a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a name in Pennsylvania after a measure victory in March’s special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. thought about penalizing El Salvador because it supports China, then changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather cordial meeting took place between Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump, who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization leadership group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to bring back heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the “recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the decision to impose sanctions was taken only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the Americans for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas, would have been worrying for the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and murdered.
After a series of internal meetings, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September senior management officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thus definitively waiving any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was tasked with presiding over the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, demonstrating the importance the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any further messages of rebuke or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, anonymously, about the internal decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who still wanted to remain anonymous.
Study the history
In the report, Special Counsel Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, a fact of which there now seems to be sufficient evidence.
According to reports, Mueller’s investigation is intended to shed light on Trump’s possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress were to pass to the Democrats, Trump would have to respond to these accusations in front of voters and perhaps a jury of his peers just as he prepares for a new candidacy.
There are many unknowns and I do not intend to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as is not that of his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the struggle could last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed on that occasion by letting go of the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now have to deal with several of them.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s position has been complicated since the paper reported that it secretly suggested last year that Trump be intercepted by questioning his ability to serve as president.
Rosenstein says the story in The Times is not true.
“How will we react if the FBI’s new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial, or if he is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections will we vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to answer for his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we will make it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles with the swastika.
With such a legacy, I can’t help but be optimistic about the future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing draw against Villarreal in Spain, would give them excellent opportunities to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Although midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season due to a knee injury in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, he believes this result will allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went through the game convinced we were doing well and we brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the draw is a fair result.
They were better in the first half, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another big European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult match because our opponents got a good result in the last game. I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not disappoint.
“Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and the changes at the club level but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the guys have fun and the preparation goes well.
We can therefore forget the problems of last season and think about the future.”
Women are concerned about the costs of long-term care
Although those who took part in the survey have clear ideas about the type of care they would like to receive, few have addressed the topic in the family.
About half of those surveyed by Nationwide say they’ve talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% say they have talked to their children about it.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide, “people want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t face this conversation.”
Here's where to start.
Discuss this with your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to assist you if you do not communicate what you want in advance.
If you have a counselor, decide with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be determining costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he will advise you how to pay the expenses you will have to face.
Choosing long-term care financing may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy with redemption value to cover these expenses or continue to pay money for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all the necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
Appoint a health care attorney so that a person you trust can oversee medical care and make sure professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of a power of attorney for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your accounts are paid in case you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the details: imagine that your elderly parent is rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down this information in detail so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just about finances, but who are the doctors?” asks Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be prepared for any eventuality.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while walking home after spending the evening outside.
The victim, a 40-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "random action".
The victim didn't see her assailant.
He is not in danger of death and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people have died as a result of a very strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The death toll is set to rise.
Communications were interrupted and rescue officials were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is close to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency extending along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of livelihood of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and especially of the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami struck the western part of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
On December 26, 2004, a massive earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half were from Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
There were more than 1,100 victims.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there was no tsunami but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of the complaint and resistance to arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she tore the phone from her hand.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his bail was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded "certainly innocent".
Palin faces three counts of first-degree crimes: up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree offense punishable by one day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under consideration by the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstruction of reporting the crime, and possession of a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder following his time in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks are not working and the death toll is set to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck off Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment of the impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Extraordinary Death Penalty for Suspects of Terrorist Attacks in NYC
New York’s federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the perpetrator of the terrorist attack that killed eight people — a rare sentence that has never been imposed for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to plunge onto a bike path along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by hitting pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Based on the conditions for the death penalty demand in the southern district of New York, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and equally “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder with criminal association, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “real planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
The preliminary notice states that “Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused damage, offense and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.”
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York prosecuted the last case of capital punishment.
The man on trial, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and indicted for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police say that in front of investigators he said he was proud of what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he had decided to carry out the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As for the 22 counts, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and sentence to life imprisonment without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s group of defenders had previously urged prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Must Conduct Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of the parliament members of Theresa May’s party suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK’s Independence Party said politicians must “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK “would already be out of Europe” if Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenges May faces in trying to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party have been underscored by the pro-European Tories who took part in a separate anti-Brexit protest in London.
The prime minister is trying to enforce the Chequers Plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and “chaos”.
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to leave the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should be entrusted to Farage.
"At this time we would already be out of Europe," he said.
Wellingborough added: “I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan.”
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought world wars to be slavish.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country.”
Bone dismissed views that public opinion would change from the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in Europe is completely false.”
MP Tory Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also attended the parade and told reporters: “I just tell the prime minister to listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who roam the streets in search of votes to allow us to be elected.
Forget the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message to May, he added: “Prime ministers can keep their seats when they keep their promises.”
At the rally, Farage said politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they intend to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the pressure feel to our political class that it is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the people’s army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists pushed the Tories against the Brexit flags after the group’s formation this weekend.
The Labour Party mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can install the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for frictionless borders and for borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a city assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
The hypothesis that he could defy Trump in 2020 was in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she would like to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for "women to go to Washington to settle the government and this implies that a woman holds the highest office."
Arrest for murder of LSU Sims player
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 a.m. on ETNews.
On Friday he released a video of the murder asking for help in identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head that resulted in his death,” Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told 247Sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the crime scene in possession of a weapon and that he struck Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and held in detention at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
A nearly two-metre junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, last season Sims played 32 games of which 10 were starting with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of team-mate Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately clear that orders from the Mercedes team would have heavily conditioned the race.
From pole, Bottas started well, leaving Hamilton to defend against Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel stopped first at the pits leaving Hamilton in the traffic of the group's tail, a move that could be decisive.
Hamilton overtook Vettel after a few wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tried to prevent him from passing inside by risking to end up outside after a double shift to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first lap he is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for most of the race without stopping at the pits for the tyre change and tried to finish quickly to overtake Kimi Raikkonen by conquering fourth place.
In the end, however, he has to make the pit stop on the 44th lap and in the remaining 8 laps is not able to increase the pace and overtake Raikkonen, who comes fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri has worked very well all weekend and he was really nice to let me through.
The team has done an outstanding job to take first and second place,” Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
At a rally Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence that she did not disclose the contents of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of attempted rape.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “mean, bad and liars.”
“What can happen and what’s happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, bad and lying,” he said.
“When there are obvious signs that the news is being leaked and those responsible say, ‘Oh no, it wasn’t me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document? - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't."
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the contents were released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion was leaked from her office.
“I didn’t hide Professor Ford’s allegations, but I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did."
But his denial is not credible for the president, who during Saturday night's rally commented: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but this is the worst example of body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of attempted sex offense by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
They don’t care who they harm, who they have to go over to take back power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants went ahead with two goals on shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to the draw before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored the draw for the Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men who on Friday night in Belfast had come back up and won the match with Dundee 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won their first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the 3:35 minute on assists by Kendall McFaull, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on assists by David Rutherford.
In what was a rather lively first half, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt provided the tie assist to Cownie in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer decreed the lead for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team repackaged and Bouchard regained the tie after a strategic maneuver at the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that brought the Dundees to the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and decreed his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight Controller Dies to Allow Hundreds of Passengers to Escape Earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after being killed to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off and rescue them.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing as a result of a very strong earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to affect the area and many are trapped among the debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which was oscillating fearfully.
He wanted to make sure that flight Batik Air 6321, which was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then threw himself out of the control tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This is really sad news for us,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the national disaster response agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is set to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and it has been impossible to reach many more,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything possible to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army men: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all activities related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air Niugini now says there is a missing person after the lagoon crash
The airline of the flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, after claiming that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to escape, now claims that there is a missing person.
According to Air Niugini news, updated on Saturday afternoon, one passenger is missing the appeal.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats rescued the other passengers and crew after the crash while the plane was attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, seven people were transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline says six passengers were admitted to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy allege that the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Witnesses say the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very low altitude.
“And it was really lucky,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he was lightly hit in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to fix a pier have provided relief using a dinghy to transport people to shore before the plane sinks into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that in the last two decades 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline aircraft accidents but none of these involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the burned woman alive
The trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 ended on Saturday with the presentation of the prosecution’s evidence.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cellphone data to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said she had retrieved location data from several cell phones that show that, contrary to what she said, Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claims to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that he was in Sanford’s truck that night, the prosecutor confirmed that he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis claimed to know Chambers two weeks ago when she died.
Cell phone data indicates that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its concluding argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to pass to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by inserting positive messages in their songs.
Bristol’s The High Breed group claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to the origins and make a kind of conscious hip-hop again.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing her with "racist" lyrics
In New York, a nanny sued a couple for firing her in a discriminatory manner after she accidentally received a text in which her mother complained that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, comparing the request to a real “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first day of work in 2016, was black.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman "embarrassed" fired Ms. Maurice saying she was not happy with their previous nanny, an African-American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
He paid Ms. Maurice for her day's work and sent her home in a taxi.
Maurice sued the couple and, for being fired, seeks compensation for the beauty of $350 a day for the six months of full-time work for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want them to understand that they can’t behave that way,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegation of racism by saying that the firing of Maurice was the only thing to do as they feared that they could not trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent her a message saying something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to a person with whom you have been rude, even if by mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth only two months ago and is in a "very difficult situation".
“You can’t be angry with a person that way.
It’s not very kind behavior,” the financial adviser added.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, the public opinion court immediately sued the spouses on social media, harshly criticizing them for their behavior and the logic followed.
A letter reveals that Paddington's publisher feared readers would not like a talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter as follows: “It’s not easy to put yourself in the shoes of those who first read the book before it was published.
It’s fun now that we know Paddington’s great success.”
Claiming that his father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children’s book inspired by a toy bear, would not have reacted well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was a bit “sad” after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
“He was a fairly quiet man, not a presumptuous person,” he says.
But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when you have a son who reaches a goal: you’re proud of it even if it’s not your credit.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success that way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the credit to Paddington himself.
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my daughter who was dying
On landing her daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really bad and that our daughter would not make it,” says Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then she called me to tell me she was going to die in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medicines that the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly fading.
She died a while before, and it was the end.
I had to sit back and wait knowing this was happening.
I couldn’t complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold back.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
“No one knew,” he says.
“All the time I was crying with my head down.
It’s hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Tickets from two women grieving to prevent suicides on deck
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide work to prevent others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she says.
Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said it illuminated every room he entered.”
But before he died he quit his job because depression had taken him “to a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he took his own life.
Davis says, "I continue to fear a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can turn to to talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don’t have to isolate themselves, they have to talk.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother’s death.
“You never said he felt down or depressed,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On Christmas Day, it hit the bottom. When the children opened the gifts, he avoided looking them in the eye."
He says that his death was a huge trauma that they had to process: "It tore the family apart.
He ripped us apart.
But we had to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain: FBI begins investigation
“I think if we could proceed as he asked, which is with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “losing its cool” because of the blockade of rooted supporters.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
Only five weeks until the midterm elections, on November 6, if the Republicans as expected get a negative result, they will be greatly weakened in their attempt to elect the man they chose for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators by pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes your report?
The Senate is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the delays and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of political refugees 'decreases' with Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge from South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, says that the number of refugees was 1,127 last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are tighter control of the border between North Korea and China and higher tariffs demanded by those who illegally take these people out.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal emigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
North-South relations, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss negotiations on denuclearization which are in a stalemate.
This comes after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. sanctions for the lack of developments since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain of our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unsuitable for Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is "characteristically unsuitable" for such a position.
Pelosi expressed this opinion Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I think if a woman had behaved the same way, they would have called her hysterical,” Pelosi said of Kavanaugh’s statement Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Visibly emotional Kavanaugh denied the allegation of sexually harassing Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in a state of emotion, almost screaming and his throat tightened by crying as he talked about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned committee Democrats who called the allegations against him an “absurd and coordinated defamatory campaign” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves he can’t enter the Supreme Court because he has proven himself prejudicial to Democrats.
“I think he excluded himself with his statements and the way he talked about the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked if she would try to indict Kavanaugh in case he was confirmed and if the Democrats would reach a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I think if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only is he not fit for the Supreme Court, but he’s not fit for the court that he’s presiding over right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh eluded questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court rulings.
Pelosi said: “You cannot send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and demand that this decision be accepted in a positive way.”
Women have to use it.
It is a fair diatribe, months and years of attacks of anger from which he cannot get out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And she went on, "It helped me a lot a woman who was a manager somewhere. She told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she had developed a technique whereby when she got angry and started crying she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And so he continued.
I thought it was a brilliant idea.”
Tears are tolerated as an outburst of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office dates back to when I once started crying for an outburst of anger. A woman older than me, a glacial manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified, took me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let me see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they’ve got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his presidential race.
In 1987, when on a boat called Monkey Business Hart’s extramarital affair was discovered that she had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she shouldn’t try herself to run for president.
“It wasn’t actually a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing about 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and we definitely didn’t need another one.
Someone called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already at an advanced stage, Schroeder was late with the fundraising and vowed that she would not apply if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost cause in the beginning.
She found that some of the supporters who had given the male candidates $1,000 to her would only give her $250.
“Do you think I can get a discount?” he asked.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions (gratitude to the people who supported her, disappointment at the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger at the sexual discrimination she was a victim of), that she was moved.
“It looked like I was in the grip of a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled, thinking about the reaction from the press.
“Someone might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
Maybe "he cried a lot."
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening blows of the U.S.-China trade war have been thunderous, and while the battle is far from over, experts say a clash between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump has already issued the first warning this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new duties on items worth more than $200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>175 billion) in value, which means taxes will be imposed on half of Chinese goods.
Beijing has reacted each time with measures of the same type by recently applying tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. one-on-one, and the world’s second-largest economic power is unlikely to back down anytime soon.
For Washington to give up, it would be necessary to yield to its demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US can positively affect China in the long run by decreasing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create the initial conditions for economic collapse in both countries is in fact far more dangerous than has been recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher studying Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation in the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he will not accept any aid subject to conditions or from those countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
US champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water at the sixteenth hole of par 3 granting victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his rounds by becoming one of the four players ever to record a 5-0-0 since the tournament with the current formula was first played in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with the score of 5&4 by the lower Danish player in the rankings Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, has surrendered for 2&1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup veteran, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia who played eight, has become the European player who has won the most in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
It’s a win for the team and I’m happy to have made my contribution,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the lead to his fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods with a 2&1 score in Sunday’s singles.
“If I think I grew up watching his matches, I’m really very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods,” Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now counts his Ryder Cup games to 13 wins, 21 losses and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think that he is one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been searching for fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europa team.
We threw this opportunity away.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players performed very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I am fond of these 12 boys and proud to be their captain.
We've had it all.
They played better than us.”
Red Tide Update: Concentration Is Decreasing at Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in red tide concentration in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, patchy flowering conditions, which suggest a decrease in concentration, are evident in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties.
The red tide bloom extends for about 130 miles of coastline from north of Pinellas County to south of Lee County.
The patches are about 10 miles off Hillsborough County but in fewer areas than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week an average concentration was reported in Pinellas County or off its coasts, a low to high concentration off Hillsborough County, from a bottom concentration to a high concentration in Manatee County, from a bottom concentration to a high concentration in Sarasota County or off its coasts, from a bottom concentration to a medium concentration in Hillsborough County.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Last week, no cases were reported in Northwest Florida.
