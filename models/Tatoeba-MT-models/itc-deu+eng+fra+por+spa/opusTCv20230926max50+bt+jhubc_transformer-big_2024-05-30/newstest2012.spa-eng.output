The parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former prime minister, but MPs rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing a disadvantageous deal with Russia for Ukraine over the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet final, the appeals court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code condemning the former prime minister was supported by 147 MPs in the vote.
Approval required 226 votes.
The victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no longer war.
It remains to be determined who is the winner.
As is already customary in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it is a matter of elucidating whether they are moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the sharia, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will have their hands cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and apostates await their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, composed of warring tribes, will unite by the Qur’an.
In Libya an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and probably did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When looking for victors in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shootout that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally with no guarantees of profit.
Following the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will oil companies get Libyan black gold just with good words?
It’s quite possible that it doesn’t, but it may be that the West can finally boast about protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of Sharia do not cross us.
A New Era of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are on the hunt for the investor seeker
A statistical whirlwind has spread across Europe
Individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interquarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data of the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the interquarter period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A> the trend towards a gradual slowdown in the growth of economic development is forming.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main events:
Annually, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but quadrennially it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous data and recalculated seasonally, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest on its ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on Czech ten-year bonds remains at 4%, although the situation in the area is worsening.
In Germany there are voices saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the Euro.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the qualifying with a bonus of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically against attacks from the local team, so they will not miss the European championship event.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in detail in a meticulous report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the heroic Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two losers of the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who missed two big occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the appointment of the European Cup, so the coffers of national football will reach an approximate gratification of 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes a good offensive game was played.
Both teams were only committed to maintaining the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicking the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
It was a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students began praying Tuesday at noon in front of the facility and then chanted death slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the nuclear technology center in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, by all indications, is striving to get nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon at the nuclear facilities in Isfahan and then launched death slogans against the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, not only the Isfahan plant but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would be reached, according to Israeli sources.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity 5%.
Obese children come mostly from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It demonstrates again the importance of the environment where you grow for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessed children eat, for example, sausages at least twice as often as children from normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of obese people had eaten fries the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence."
In families of overweight children there is no practice of sports, which is applicable to most families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 basic education children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from 4th to 8th grade.
A proper diet and plenty of exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of children who are overweight and even obese.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals per day according to the regimen: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," one of the survey results said.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
The specialists warn that, in a healthy development, are important, in addition, the details, which also count, such as having a fixed time for breakfast in the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
But the worst thing was to discover that in 10% of households nothing is eaten for breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, insane chips are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet soft drinks daily (70%).
As a general rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sport, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study made it possible for the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all the possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal."
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
“The popularity of sweet soft drinks is especially alarming,” the study’s final report warns.
The main meal is the palm, the pasta, followed closely by the poultry.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
“In the control group of study participants, who completed the questionnaire after completing the ‘Obesity is not a coincidence’ prevention program, there was in many cases an important change in favor of the principles of healthy eating,” the study’s results show.
It is interesting, for example, about soft drinks, where many children would start to prefer normal water.
Children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire poultry and fish for the main meal and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How stylists learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the entertainment world.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it no longer fits a pin.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) about how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short-skinned, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the type of Jennifer Lopez, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress her in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so great that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth having at least one extra piece of custom fabric sewn.
They will certainly not regret it, because the clothes they feel perfectly are priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, embellishments, embroidery or draping.
There are certainly many kinds of diverse information and bodies, so I am glad that I have all week to put order in my head all this information.
And even so, I'm afraid with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who must design two wardrobes: one for the day and another for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I've had to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have gained a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
The dresses we have to cut them from the magazines or search them on the internet and print them, to then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what the full result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist, therefore, does not only dress physically, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (concrete topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The designer and designer Mario Kameník told us about all of this.
But all this is for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three invited specialists animated the conference on Saturday with information on all types of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is fundamental in this case.
Thus, such a gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed to the classic with jeans and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body in heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just roll up your sleeves and raise your neck to get a totally different image.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value the most is the following advice: "To start working, you must first know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
At last it is clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if later it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reservation than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (thus, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> assured us that the image and style alone represent, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is not yet a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance does not matter so much).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must keep in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate a size very different from their actual size (smaller).
Then it only remains to gugle and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened/slimmed, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion, but that he has to understand outfit.
During your work, you should especially communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn’t miss them, he defends their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify the wardrobe and complete it with nice clothes, you can't take and throw away everything that was there and say, 'Oh, what a horror.'"
“Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend so someone can put them on,” Mario says.
He also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
They are objects such as scissors, such as scissors, hair clippers, or must-haves. There is also nylon yarn (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or hats), special tweezers for hooking clothes in front, if this was larger (pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a set of fabric.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to cover the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, you could damage the sole and even more the outside.
And we did nothing but clothe and clothe.
We could not touch the shoes with scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I'm not very good at those skills.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that dedicating myself to styling at a professional level is not a road of roses, but I do not care exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run you compete across America.
Reviewed
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated by a series of improper carelessnesses of a routine trip during tomorrow’s shift.
To a certain extent, the expectations were met, but this was of no use if, in reality, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new installment, which is added to the title The Run, aroused great expectations already before its premiere.
He promised that he would give new airs to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, as a result of what was shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being a simple action genre again.
We are also curious to know how the inserted scenes would look, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total count points are lost due to absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In reality they cannot even be called errors, but it is rather the incomprehensible dislike of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then over fifty races.
From this it follows that each race takes place by a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing from the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you have to be careful not to bury an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of rivals (normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (timed classic duel) and then a duel awaits you against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this appears sometimes the police, which does nothing but make things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you would expect (specifically, there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous episodes.
That means that it is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you’re looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race conceived with a lot of action is well suited to this style of driving, although we can find something better among the competition games.
So far, everything in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, collisions are no longer the same.
From games of this type you can not expect to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, with which everything is not in order.
It is typical that, when doing a very tight overtaking or circulating the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or leave the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five resets are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is nothing more than a help in case something goes wrong, but it is not very trustworthy.
Sometimes, even resetting does not help, it only helps to learn the given stage by heart.
A major disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see that two cars that meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It is the same when you arrive, because it is programmed because the “surprise” will always happen before your noses.
Adversaries also have an advantage.
Throughout the game you will arrive at places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always overtake you in the same place.
In addition this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at any price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming in front of you, so at first you can muffle the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that you will surely be disappointed right away.
And it’s a shame, because even though the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the ranking in the race so it doesn’t fit the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to be aware of the gasoline supplies next to the road, because precisely there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will have enough what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition main narrative thread also appears a parallel challenge thread, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know by the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver is given several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community features.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the subway tunnel (pass), where you start running in the dark on the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, the metro convoy arrives behind you and takes you in front without further ado.
In the writing we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects are in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
What a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This especially affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the "each of his father and mother" category, but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for their music.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It feels like the game is not over.
The fun is guaranteed, but be prepared because the mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of airport reflectors.

Vicenová, Ambassador to the EU:
The Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
“I didn’t expect a war without a barracks.”
"It will take five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," said Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenová.
How not to take seriously his motto "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers of the U. Carolina School of Law.
Vicenova also weighed the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
“First comes the criticism, that if he’s silly, a grey official, able to take on any role, but I have to say that he left everyone baffled, because he assumes his roles perfectly.”
“He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, how to communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.”
The new post of representative for Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards unification and clarification of political union in the face of States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda followed, follows and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has a lot of commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good uproar", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being addressed now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget, caused by the current much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive the most support and which will receive the least? That is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main motto, with which she came to Europe: "About Europe clearly".
“The truth is that I don’t like ugly abbreviations, foreignisms or slang that people don’t understand.”
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented, curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes, or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptic and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
In addition, he lamented the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault lies in a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of motivation, but also the lack of support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes up to me, a Frenchman next to me says, ‘What, you guys from the Visegrad Group are left?’ and it turns out it’s not funny.
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, is facing tough new budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, than the new "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
“It was said for the first time that only those countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, should stay out.”
"These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen the two-speed Europe," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the entire EU must be debated between member states, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were looking for a term that would define IBM’s strategy with great precision, the most approximate would be “long term”.
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet it has been a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis for this long-term character was laid by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his seal, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully crafted corporate culture.
“For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
This has enabled us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We look forward to thriving even more in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current CEO.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as early as the 1930s, cared about caring for his employees as the Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a entrepreneur in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American workers to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, stylish uniforms and a sophisticated compensation system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers).
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
Already from the beginning the company knew how to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to end any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, by which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has worked for 30 years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
During the last years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which arise endless future strategies and innovations.
Not surprisingly, there are plenty of ideas, as nearly half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technology company,” says Harvard Business School professor economist and author of the IBM book Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that is trying to solve business problems for technology users,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
This year, IBM has become the second technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on advancing, it cannot be emotionally anchored in the past,” said Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and likewise, if they don’t work, it abandons them).
And this is the difference of the competition, Microsoft, which basically remains and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one-fifth are programs and one-fifth are equipment.
However, even in 1990, equipment accounted for more than half of the suppliers' share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets for a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis manifested itself for the first time.
IBM is acting on the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far the IBM company has been able to cope with the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.
IBM’s motto is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Spaceflight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 – originally a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He possessed inventions such as the famous "ticketing clock", which allows controlling the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint hired the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The new leader overshadowed the IBM founder (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are underpinned).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During Watson’s first four years at the helm, revenue doubled by $9 million and the company’s massive expansion across continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly forty years in the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
In 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which established the standard of computers of that time, came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer a complete advice and services of high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, “a smarter planet.”
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not improved, for example, with regard to transport and city management.
For the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the full business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932 it opened a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. Also here is a world-renowned research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45), but also her lover, Darina was still hoping that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, he is no longer going to wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but not like my partner anymore," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová explained.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová welcomed Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ové into her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98>í<0xC4><0x8D>any and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly stated that he loved her.
Eventually, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship, and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will kick him out.”
"But here I would live no longer as my dear old donkey who was mistaken, but as a man to whom certain ties bind me," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová said, adding that she had already disengaged herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't care if he's a woman, he's locked the back door.
“I accept my wife’s decision.”
“I’ll be with Iveta and there’s no change possible.”
“My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
"The company is still in effect, I do the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I talk normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová found a new love, he would not object.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t care where she is going or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” concludes Josef.
Women’s Worst Vices: Do They Also Refer to You?
If you ask men to be able to cite some of the typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that manage to boil the blood of men?
Go shopping
Do you blame your half-orange for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one trapito per week?
Do you like to buy often on sale?
So in your case it can be said that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But let’s see, what woman could resist the temptation to just walk around the clothing stores, look for tight garments and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can practically become hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve already told your partner to better wait for you at the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
Is that right?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complaining all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Cleanliness and order in the first place
It's like an endless roller coaster.
Clean windows, vacuum clean, scrub the floor, remove dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for dirtying a freshly cleaned sink and a shelf with glass doors that cost you so much to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness surely should not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Making unpleasant comments
"Used pants are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to wear those worn socks tomorrow too."
"Wet rag is not left on the floor!"
If you do those cometaries to your partner more times a day, know that this way you will manage to get him out of his boxes.
Naturally. You don't mean anything wrong, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women also get slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, which is why they like to talk about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless gossip.
With the hand on the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who do not control themselves, who love to gossip and often do, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromír Jagr took part in the NHL match on Monday with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and put Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star’s play, and took a step further and was declared the best player of the match.
Two assists were awarded in the match and also Jágr's partner, Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the meeting, Jágr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Before the match I told him I would triple."
“I introduced him.”
"Sometimes they seem like ambush," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first strike.
A while later the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trace.
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek took the disc behind the Hurricanes' goal and moved it through the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was kicked out, but from the beginning of the second half they already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through the quarter of Wayne Simmonds' goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say that he's the best player on the court, but he's certainly among the top three," Jágr said.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him."
"I'm very pleased with it."
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my teammates were playing for me, and that now produces results," added Jágr.
Carolina still turned the match into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu’s goal and then again Dwyer’s penalty kick until he got a goal away.
Matt Read allowed no further complications, though they ended up outnumbered two to one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I got it," described Vora<0xC4><0x8D>ek the last goal of the match as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an injury to the upper body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of defensive experience, but also by a two-goal difference, 2:3.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec did not know how to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost the local coach regretted the large number of injured in the last row, and play the match only with five defenders.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels."
"Well, there's nothing you can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
“So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn’t resist it.”
"We had to simplify the game even more, take the disc out of our field."
"And so we left gaps," said one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty interventions from Winnipeg in the 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players who ended a series of losses that lasted five games.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time sold travel only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when one could travel to Yugoslavia, however, afterward the Yugoslav regime leaned west and the trips of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (that is, also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise, individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, but one had to queue with a sleeping bag and spend the night, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without exchange guarantee, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way Czechs travel has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, that the present favourite destination, Croatia, could not be travelled freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s, visa-free travel to neighbouring Western European states was imposed, prompting a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not see enough of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris groups of Czechs slept in the parks in tents, since our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was to take with them food (preserves, sausages, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it also the average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in the demand for travel began agencies, starting in 1997 regularly, to prepare the trips using the connections of charter flights, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs were traveling visa-free to almost every developed country except the US, which made our travels even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czechia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights depart every year with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries. This winter will fly directly from Czech to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. removed visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in its history, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history, more than 15,000 CZK per head were spent on trips abroad, including expenses at the place of stay.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, who could end up deadlocked again.
For almost five months Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to follow.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June not without first summoning his colleagues in order to find a strong person who would know how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, a controversy arose between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This became evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní d<0xC5><0xAF>m), located in the Prague neighborhood of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only on the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers.
From that moment on, and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed by the Executive Committee, which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
Opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the crux remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three FA<0xC4><0x8C>R vice-presidents, who, from the association's leadership, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round, the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy will win.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that the candidate with the highest total percentage of votes in both federations can win.
The Bohemian party, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," that is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian party, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With that said, surprisingly, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all the candidates are best suited to Pelta.
"I would like it to be voted to the fullest in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense about representatives is invented as at the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be appeased with today's match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will once again be the protagonist, and so we will cooperate more at ease," says the representative of Jablonice, which of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
“It’s not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to your own convenience.”
"This may result in a further blockade of the General Assembly."
“Anyway, I hope common sense will be imposed,” Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at ministerial level, which they say will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country for an agreement to be reached.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovakian Sports Federation (<0xC4><0x8C>STV) which will try to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he can’t find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), nor would he stand as a candidate for such a relevant position.
“If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and not running for election.”
“But to this day we have not been able to find such a person,” Paclík told the Czech News Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>TK).
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the election, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R).
Paclík also points out that, in case of winning, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would come.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too much related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to some people I might consider.”
"For me it was crazy to hear some say that right now they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
“I would like to change that view,” he adds.
What supposedly annoys Paclík at this time is Pelta’s relationship with the President of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting on the presidential armchair.
"In case he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
“With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will take even less advantage,” Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was associated with a wiretapping during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out with impunity.
“I don’t know what prestige in football Pelta’s victory could bring.”
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paclík, who also takes some caution in his earlier statement that "Club Pilsen would sell out if Pelta becomes president."
If he wins the election on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Similarly, the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one to follow."
"He's very capable."
“I could imagine it, for example, as head of the representation.”
"but not as a manager of an association."
"I don't put my nose where I don't feel capable either," added Paclík, who in September garnered much attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitrators' Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the partnership.
He relies on his management skills of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the victory in the first division in May.
“I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to their safe practice.”
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations," Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta president Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>etínsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exerted pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport from lottery taxes.
“It’s one of the key issues that the new president should be addressing.”
"If they raised taxes on gambling, as the political parties announce, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going," he said.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with Club Pilsner, although he himself states that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R President should be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"Not ideal."
“But I don’t see any sense in hypocritically ceding my Pilsen Club shares to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half,” Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes that would put an end to the election deadlock.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R had new statutes that would serve definitively to settle, in the future, disputes regarding the electoral rules.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the non-elections in September, Pelta promised to focus, should he be elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this postponement of two months could do well to defend and present, in a wider context, his ideas on the management of football.
"People at all levels have been dealing with football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new president this Thursday."
“They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association,” thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the Association’s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly the statutes were approved which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president already since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the re-adaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win over the delegates.
“If I’m elected president, I’ll take it as a personal challenge and I’m willing to respond in case this fails.”
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we can’t exist,” Pelta says.
Also, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time since he had attacked Thomas Paclík, who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with a head.
“He’s been in the football world for over a year, and he’s already achieved some successes.”
“Their attacks were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign.”
“That’s why many of them doubt their true character,” he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest competitions to the highest.
The latter should be a showcase for football promotion.
“I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Immediately afterwards I would be involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal changes to the squad.
“I would have to know the tasks of each employee first,” he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness reigns.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain on Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader," Pelta is still optimistic two days ahead of the most decisive day in his representative career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working with enthusiasm.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that if elected, he will work hard.
It wants to implement systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
He is also committed to resolving the Bohemians case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work begun by former President Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I would like to devote myself entirely to football.”
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, from professional football to the training of young high-performance footballers."
“With this I don’t mean I would do everything alone,” Rajchl said in an interview for the <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I am a team player and I want to divide the competencies of the executive committee in such a way that each member can dedicate themselves to a specific area.”
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
“A lot of people probably won’t like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others.”
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, he is said to have considered not running again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step," he said.
“A lot of people have told me that I should not give up, because then they would give up the others too.”
“It’s about having faith not to give up like that, without further ado,” he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work that has already begun with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work that I don’t want to lose now is over.”
"There are processes that had begun and that will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he announced worried that, if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could return to the way it was before the time of Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“I believe in order, and it’s something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him are above all those people who would take care of football so that it would be just a privilege for a few chosen ones."
“I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
"I try to be objective."
“I want to make football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia."
“For example, it’s time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech part and a Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division.”
"It wouldn't be the current situation where we have only three Moravian teams, which is a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential election, Rajchl does not stop believing in his chances of being elected.
“I still feel like I have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and knows that behind me there are clear successes,” said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns of disadvantageous contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his share of guilt in the fact that the federation is not united.
And while he proclaims Pelta is “disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football,” he sees the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer to football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has already started and will not significantly change the staffing of the committees."
"I don't want to use that to my advantage," Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Leap to Blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where the best well-being in water is found.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn’t miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying on her back above the water, she looked up at the artistic dome, swimming towards the marble angels, who waited for her at the edge of the pool and was amazed at the meticulously restored Modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, he took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true fan of bathing culture.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sport, Meder says, just water is different.
He’s only upset that bathing enthusiasts have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while running enthusiasts can breathe in the fascinating smell of the fir forests or hear the cheerful trills of the birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The splash in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna.The well-being factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are cared for, according to Meder.
And if the builder tries hard, indoor pools can be a real gift to the eye: "Instead of floor, in the bathrooms you have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is bent optically: the high vaults, the colorful tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data about architecture and the history of art in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, makes you want to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector, discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, there are nitrate waters in a unique karst cavity (bathrooms in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are of alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberén).
Many outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts its eyes on the roofed pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The perhaps most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: <0xC3><0x96>tztal’s water cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steam rises in winter, while in the background the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, was not invaded by the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of <0xC3><0x81>rpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people believe they have reached a toilet.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legumes stick to the skin when entering the pool, a well-being enjoyment in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed at one place in her search for beautiful places for bathing, when she wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she came across blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow Modernist building, he saw the weeds grow among the tiles.
The decline countered in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; you can not only discover neo-Romanesque elements from the time of its construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall in the Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural from the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” Meder says.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not have much importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the commodities business
by Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural commodity business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents claim Deutsche Bank and other lenders are pulling out of the business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives up prices, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The campaign of the consumer advocate is directed specifically at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity betting was intended to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled from offers and demands, and profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said no business "deserves to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be finalized by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank’s board of directors, along with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank’s management will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “Betting on rising food prices shows in a particularly drastic way how ruthless banks are currently harming public welfare.”
Ackermann finds himself as the biggest banking lobbyist, especially in bonds.
"Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio where it puts money into food price betting," Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of starving people or the fame of Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was unplanned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial agrarian speculation it can perfect its image.
And he needs to care little about possible losses, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in commodities
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on Nov. 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer food-priced investments.
Many clients of the bank showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agrarian speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
The 21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion Moved
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern postwar architecture is passionate, clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its lightweight, floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to this day a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian Pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the flattened adjacent building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was erected after the universal exhibition in the Schweizer Garten next to Vienna’s southern station, was refurbished in 1962 and inside a 20th century museum was inaugurated, it was called the “20th house”.
The building was suitable but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is decaying more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calling it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, made a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, PhD in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic skating on ice in her youth, later in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim museum and founding director of the museum of modern art in Salzburg, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the eponymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he sensitively reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy devourer," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed, and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in antique mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monuments office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office,” says Krischanitz and warns of rough flooring in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
What happened to the pavilion "that came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "coincidental appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "awaken the right consciousness".
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has happened a stroke of urban luck. The totally new and planned "central station neighborhood", with homes and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And maybe another stroke of luck will happen: The 21st house could receive a reinforcement from another construction of Krischanitz, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary art room in Berlin and, as is heard, negotiates with the city about a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a million-dollar winter crisis package
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against the breakdowns and delays of the trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent this year more than 70 million euros, according to a journalistic report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments until 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
For this, better availability of vehicles and the railway network must be achieved even in extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 posts to remove snow from tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of breakdowns and delays on trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for an authorization from the federal railway office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to test the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the breakage of an axle in Cologne’s central station.
Deutsche Bank Paying Billionaire Fines in the U.S.
After the turmoil over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, the Deutsche Bank must pay a millionaire fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in a deal, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA reproaches many large banks for inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such bonds lost their value during the financial crisis and dragged banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank does not admit any guilt with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, welcomed the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
The NCUA is trying to make up for the millions of losses it caused.
The agreements currently closed are its first type.
The regulator had also asked for accounts from other major banks and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the matter of dubious mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, it led to doom for many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, there is currently a tricky wind blowing for U.S. banks.
Investors and the inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or sanction faults.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the highest number of lawsuits.
It reproaches the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Also the Deutsche Bank has a claim from the FHFA, it is business valued at 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to answer for "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
The guru of finance, Buffett, invests heavily in the information technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies since the forecasts of the long-term development of the companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s trade report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM offers above all services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the Information Technology primitive should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has unveiled on CNBC that it has acquired shares of IBM worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM didn’t know anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the leadership that dealt with ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long established lucrative information technology services such as computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old IT pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
By contrast, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, at a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 subsidiaries of its own, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname "Omaha oracle".
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s shares in the stock exchange rose one percent.
“The Blue Giant,” as IBM is known, has a market value of more than $220 billion and ranks, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The Threat Is Concrete
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
A newspaper talks about a “bloody ideology” that is reviving.
The murders of eight tricky Greek small businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin there has been a reaction with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that had long been thought dead has returned, since the bombings in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of far-right violence against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The far-right network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology reviving again?", headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, the weekend remembered the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with German and Turkish politicians reflected in a solemn act on the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German deal.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media like a slap in the face: “The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary,” says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform “Haber X,” referring to the backdrop of the murder chain.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on tracing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says the headline of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He points out that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behaviour of the police and their subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are amazed that German authorities have not searched for suspects much earlier in the far-right circle.
Some are even less rhetorical about the drastic media: "From now on it is lost, immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and armaments."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network," Selen writes.
This means that if Germany’s internal peace is in jeopardy, the Mölln and Solingen bombings will be cleared up in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been engraved on German and Turkish memories.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group feeling of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press mainly criticised the shortcomings of German politics following the attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit the Mölln survivors.
After the Solingen fire attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
The current information in the Turkish media again shows how profound the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country has been since then.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, this time frank words are needed.
The Lake Zurich Scandal Bank
The riskiest bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
It is now run by a German.
Axel Weber probably didn’t think about it.
After his spectacular departure from the summit of the federal bank, in July it became known that in 2013 he would start on a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the administrative board of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and drops kind remarks about his future partners.
"USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I am happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A financial operator of the USB in London evaded all of the bank’s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, general manager of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to attend.
The chairman of the board of directors of the USB has since felt equally touched, and everyone asked: When will Axel Weber arrive?
It has been reported that Weber will be advising the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank reported Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and a counselor, and he has had a period of adaptation that is surely necessary.
Suddenly he is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven again that it deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other hand, for years, it has been slipping from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared to the once proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also crafty, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
At $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the great banks of the world.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
“From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?”
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, something went wrong with USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was regarded as a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses on high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To charge with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, naturally that some looked with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that its name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second highest paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought troublesome securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsorily convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic results of Switzerland (see graph).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a fiscal dispute with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified benefits of these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS more or less confessed to having helped in tax fraud.
At the same time, he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for rich clients: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the administrative council.
And the exodus of clients' funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculations and in the administration of goods through aid to tax fraud.
And just when it was getting quieter again, just when it was thought that UBS would get it back, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it turned out, apparently, this still doesn’t work well with risk management in investment banking.
“The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also confident: "The problem with UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So came the idea of the precaution, with which the Swiss bankers had been presenting themselves for a long time, to be the guardians of the greatest goods in the world: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to bankrupt on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich does not fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is only a little older.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelers like Tiffany’s among traditional Swiss businesses like the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been residing here for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse palace, to elitist private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception room of the UBS is entered by means of a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered in marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bank there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or have betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both large banks.
UBS has become too big, he says, mainly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then disaster came, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash."
Politicians allocated up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they think about it?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too large for small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different UBS precursor banks: a rich but dormant bank with the center of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a big financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It's clear: The mess came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Get Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headlined the "League Tables", the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the summit.
A few steps went well.
In forex trading and stock trading it was at the highest.
However, the commissioned business advisors highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the banking language “fixed income”, there is enormous compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Greedy for growth, they invested both the bank itself and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine for securitizing American mortgage loans and then selling them, keeping certain risks at its own expense.
And also, like other banks sought the downside for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager had to leave, as the attempt to order turned out to be more complicated than they expected.
Posts at UBS have become projectable seats and are unsafe to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Banking expert Geiger has an idea: end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking must decrease a lot, it is clear nowadays.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he prevailed: He must permanently run UBS’s business, the Zurich bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to be asking today.
So far he only says he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession weighs on U.S. stock market
The impending recession in Europe has frightened U.S. investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome are still not in force.
The slowdown in industrial production on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing a debt crisis at its origin.
General relief may not be imposed on the changes of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has been half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First and foremost, financial assets are listed on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of standard values closed with a fall of 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.
In the session, the market barometer ranges between 12,027 and 12,170 points.

In Frankfurt, the Dax index fell 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is at the end of its boom.
Companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, according to Eurostat’s statistics office.
What created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We are not an island, if not dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for CNBC.
Therefore, from their point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws a decade of old principles overboard and enters the U.S. tech sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the traditional consortium’s stock price and makes it trade against the market trend at first just a percentage higher.
The value closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
After some indications, Buffett paid an average of $170 for each unit and maintained 5.5 percent.
The stock price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway fell 1.3 percent.
Bank of American shares were clearly stronger at 2.6 percent than the market.

Smart fats spread in cities
In many places greasy birds are considered “problem birds”: these very intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the greasy belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors accumulate for the garbage and the noise of the animals.
Although no means has appeared against "problem birds" so far.
The greasy no longer leave the cities, say experts at the first symposium on greasy in Leer, East Friesland.
There, specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of the field of certain protected fats; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end traditional living spaces.
The hunting, the growing building and the falling of trees that host them make life difficult for the birds.
The greases are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass kill the district’s fats made negative headlines.
Critics have rated the hunting of animals using bird traps and the killing with sticks as especially brutal.
"Expelling them and driving them away in the normal way does not achieve anything," said Werner Klöver, urban planner and landscaper at Leer.
Shooting water into nests or throwing trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals deviate, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere.”
Throwing them away is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of chasing animals from sensitive residential areas and baiting them back to settle elsewhere is possible.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist, publicizes against treating animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can bear a beak in the face with aplomb."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger Grays teaching circuit, where signs inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on criticism for bird noise: "They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the fat ones not only take advantage of the resources to access shale bites, but they manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists from the University of Cambridge checked on four fats how far the intelligence of birds goes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second rehearsal, the cunning greasers had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they caught the bucket in the tube handle.
Three of the four fats got it on the first attempt.
Portugal in Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the last tickets for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal scored Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after a 0-0 first leg, made the five Euro appearances in a row.
The Czechs scored 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs back game with outsider Montenegro, after they made things clear in the first leg (2-0).
Croatia did not let them score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a loose 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals from Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the play-offs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal began in a perfect way.
Ronaldo executed a direct free kick from more than 30 meters to get to the head in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his ability to score from afar and scored 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not fight in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance thanks to scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, leader of the English Manchester City sent a header to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek hit for the Czech Republic
Then the collegiate Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of Penati Bosnia, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself on the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark painted a controversial penalty following an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European runner-up clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished with the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal by Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualified for the fifth time in a row for the Euro.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) also had luck and had to overcome a reaction second in the initial phase.
In the last minute, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflex a possible goal on Tomas Sivok's own goal (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the lap from the front, very right on Cech's goal.
After the break, the Czechs had to protect the goalkeeper's back, and the striker from FC Seoul escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the match.
Meanwhile, Turkey has missed the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go beyond a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink should leave his seat on the third-placed bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians celebrated their fourth appearance in the Euro final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. The attacker Kazim Kazim could not send the ball into the goal either.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not let any goals be scored.
Alongside Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made way for Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga legionaries in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Euro
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate the first participation in the Euro since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, which triumphed 4-0 in the one-way match prepared for a previous decision, topped in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pushed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Los Angeles Galaxy’s Robbie Keane got his first big shot.
From the very first moment, the defensive team avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he was ahead of him.
After a defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, taking the 1-0.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
SAP, Europe’s largest software maker, invests billions in China in the coming years and wants to nearly double its number of employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars (approximately 1.5 billion euros) will circulate, the dax consortium reported Tuesday.
“We will get more facilities for research and development and we will hire workers,” said Bill McDermott, co-chair, at a conference in Beijing.
The staff is expected to grow from 2,500 workers currently to 4,500.
The number of branches of the international market leader for enterprise software will be doubled from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s more than 176,000 international customers are based in the booming country.
Growth plans in China are also an important element of the dax consortium’s 2012 strategy.
SAP wants to increase its sales volume for 2015 to 20 billion euros.
Last year, it received approximately 12.5 billion euros.
Today, the software provider’s business, which employs 50,000 workers worldwide, is doing as well as few times in the past.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Currently we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
“Our goal is to activate lasting growth in China through broad instruction.”
Massacres on a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story About World War I, “begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one’s soul fall to one’s feet.
Here are some action tips: Smoothly start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in the novel narrative of Mr. Englund, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments in which, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he rightly describes as “a work of anti-history.”
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
"The beauty and pain of battle" combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go mad or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mix while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund’s book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench warfare on the Western Front.
"The Beauty and Pain of Battle" is expertly moved through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book have hives on them; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a heartwarming book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, a Katrina hurricane that stinks like cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
“The lack of facts,” observes Mr. Englund, “has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
“The Beauty and Pain of Battle” follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the high seas fleet.
His stories have mostly been obtained from memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives may be frightening or moving, but they are more alive in Mr. Englund’s accumulation of small moments, lost details.
Many of these are about deprivation and dealing with what is there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl she says: "Successors, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed into ram fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from dried potato roots and peels; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, notes, “837 meat substitutes allowed in sausage production, 511 coffee substitutes registered.”
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards savagery and declares about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are conceived for and not for sitting in armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretending that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starchy, studded breastplate."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
“Once you resign yourself to the thought of sacrificing yourself, you’d like to think it could happen in front of the audience,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar to “a convict being strangled in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” Mr. Englund writes, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in fine-dressed clothes who executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both ignoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund speaks of soldiers who actively tried to catch a prostitute venereal disease as a way to evade service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and soak their genitals in hopes of ending up in hospital," he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often results in lifelong blindness.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Modern Memory by Paul Fussell, or novels such as Novelty on the Front by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive stories.
Mr. Englund’s volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction play.
I won't reveal it.
But it’s as if he came from his book, tore that page of dramatis personae out of your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen overnight from Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, could not be repeated, breaking the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the “okupas”.
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking at Zuccotti.
The agents increased the so-called disorder training — counter-terrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came at the “last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as “an exercise.”
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they were not told it was to enter Zuccotti Park," the person said, speaking anonymously.
“The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels in the department.”
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, agents wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district — dozens of mobile agents who routinely flooded high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, such as those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do it when there were the fewest people in the park,” he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with spotlights and speakers gathered at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
Lights and pre-recorded messages echoing from the loudspeakers appeared to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windbreaks, many protesters simply picked up their stuff and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said there was an attempt to prevent them from seeing police coming into action in the park, and that they had been treated harshly by officers.
Mr Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the park’s western edge, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the protesters’ dense tangle of personal effects, including luggage and garbage bags of paper and plastic cluttered with clothes, Cleaning Department teams followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged outside, with images appearing on the Internet shortly thereafter.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people in the camp’s epicenter locked each other by the arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service officers were called in to cut the padlocks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for “disruption of public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the senior officer in uniform in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department’s chief detective, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not directing the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen extending the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for the layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, alleging that the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, from the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other low-paid employees lost their jobs on Oct. 7, in what union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal to allow the city last spring access to a health care fund run by working groups to close its budget gap.
Municipal authorities have categorically denied the allegation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, Education Counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget approved in June.
A council member countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that the school’s support staff members would be fired.
37 municipal district officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that he would be sued. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city’s Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as well as most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and could therefore not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees because they had been chronically under-subsidized.
While there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendees lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight attendees employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.S. District 36’s budget fell by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been deceived by language in a memo authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" most often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school payroll to a job exchange, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
“Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,” says the draft complaint, “and not just in surplus.”
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on the Capitol are finally willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and for U.S. involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya, as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libyan debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were arguing with each other and the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never got a vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have slashed funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory — with Congress annoying enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Then the congressional indecision was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to liberate themselves” and “praises the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar’s spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is voting this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a full House or Senate vote in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far been unsuccessful in getting their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates - the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate - and others with slight variations from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but give their sponsors — especially novice Republicans looking to refine their resumes — the opportunity to boast that they were the “authors” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can serve, while Rep. José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one banning the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of states.
So enthusiastic that the members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
Beaten but not defeated, Giffords speaks in first TV interview since shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at a constituent act in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along with the Broadway tune “The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow” and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his ABC News appearance "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and which passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and described his recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked how he felt, 41-year-old Giffords responded: “Pretty good.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special program, which aired on the eve of the publication of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program analyzed Giffords’ recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar running through her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up while her husband cheers on her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A frown of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What."
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - "toasted," a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to first ask about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
“A lot of people died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
“You’ve just been beaten.
And you’re going to come out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to come back stronger than ever.”
Troops make you feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines burst into their posts around him.
The label crowd stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were regarded as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
“They were shown as a kind of orphaned child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, it was a pity.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant, sometimes worshiping, American public.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if they feel sorry for those in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive one for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War faced was much worse.
As a result, most pity conversations are held quietly and privately among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an “angry and violent veteran under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to endure under the pressure of demanding Washington work immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling his children.
The military concern arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were altogether common in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public largely focuses on the depth of a service member’s suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for their alleged passivity to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are being organized for the next one.
Soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a packet of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded an alarm signal,” Lyman says.
However, the Texas native set aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he alleges.
This week, on Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision at a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether their lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of the soldiers’ constitutional rights.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C., lawyer, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or deliver adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going to the army's main square, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals?
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, he will file several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy — in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers’ teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the army to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other lawsuits are underway, in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on “personality disorder” diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service — a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefits claims for people who say they have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been tabled in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense’s Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response.
However, the aggressions are remarkably underreported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, it amounts to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial — half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe his attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 different times to a crowd of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and her assailant's blood - from a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember I said to my commanding officer, ""That wasn't their judgment. That was my judgment. ""
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was discharged from service on less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefits.
As for whether the case brought by Lyman and his suitmates continues, it’s a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, “In my opinion, they should be able to move on.”
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence as responsibility.
He adds, "The odds are strongly against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go its way, Burke, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, will queue her other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform occurs,” he says.
"Or until we die, whichever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time leading up to his attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to reach them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook’s personal information storehouse is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy — the way sellers have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries — all without leaving the office.
“It’s a whole new way of doing research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
“Those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in likes, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom, boosting the number of academic papers with the site’s name in the title to nearly 800 percent in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach with a folder on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You’d have to go through the game, and they’d never let you in,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook eliminates all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who talked about their feats of drunkenness on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student publish too many status updates with their drunkenness.
“You can’t treat a problem if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Institute for Child Research, the Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify at-risk children who would otherwise not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly “pinking” its own population for data.
The site’s Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine’s Day, the expectation of election participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative term, and a National Happiness Index (mostly using information that can be accessed – long-standing digital freedom advocates who argue that the site should make its vast amount of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted with public Facebook walls of students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know which part of a user’s profile information and wall posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” says Selwyn.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper clip and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for going into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about the social — and a lot of the social still happens offline.”
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik Makes First Public Appearance in Court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
"I'm a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Knights Templar," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
“I oppose the court because it received the mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I acknowledge the facts but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for an additional 12 weeks, banned him from access to the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of advancing towards the conclusion.
“I thought it looked cold and inhumane,” a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge ruled he is not a mentally ill, and said there was no evidence he acted with accomplices.
Some may find it comforting that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically soothe the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I'd like it to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like it," a relative of a victim said.
"It would be much easier if it seemed so."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview Showed at a Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs’ death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford – distinguishing the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been dusted off as a preview of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
He was certainly a self-recognized designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a junkie of flowcharts — a man who believed many executives suffered from “a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringley was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley’s interview was used on Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during transport.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly re-released footage is the basis for Steve Jobs: The 68-minute Lost Interview, which hits Landmark theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers – from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, looking for precision.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient due to Cringley’s questions, pushing him to go faster towards the most important topics or arguments.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there’s something strangely prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous reviews of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the eager dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
About how you learned to run a business:
“Over the years in the business, I always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers they give you invariably are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs goes into detail on his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Bewildered by the way in which costs were recorded – often starting with a “standard cost” that was made to look good, and then adjusted with a “variable” – he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine retail commercial costs.
The Pope's Joke:
Jobs narrates the “Blue Box” he built himself with Steve Wozniak – a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world a half dozen times and you were yelling through the payphone and I was coming back a minute later to the payphone next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us, we didn’t know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the U.S. diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the pope himself was awakened to go and answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling over the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call to him.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for it.
Improving innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Early in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a customer if he could assemble the entire equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalled the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments ... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got tired and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About large companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s renaissance, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble on his vision, and lose control of their market share.
“Tell me you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers and printers, so what?”
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is these kinds of people who end up running companies and the people in charge of the products are kicked out of the forum for decision making.
The genius of the products that led to that position of monopoly rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
Innovation as an Artistic Expression:
“There’s a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows.”
A lot is learned about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to do – some things you can’t do that electrons do, glass does, robots do, factories do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjusting them all at once...
In the end it all comes down to taste – it goes down to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been embarrassed about stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who casually were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computers, you could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas Dinner with Health Care Law Rivals as Court Accepts Case
The day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept President Obama’s challenge to health care law, two of his magistrates, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were gifted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion came last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the petitions for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The magistrates agreed to allow the lawsuit to proceed and, in fact, a five-and-a-half-hour historic plea is expected by March, and the outcome is likely to further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court’s decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and claim that the law should be scrapped will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Attendees included Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal magistrates.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under Canon Code 4C, which says: “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related and other organizations, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia and Thomas’ absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This impressive ethics gap and indifference to the code goes against the lawsuits of several magistrates that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“The judges were gifted at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending before the court.”
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say mix court activity too easily with the agenda pushed by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the Obama administration’s attorney general when the first legal challenges to the law were presented to the trial court.
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law to now be impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he will.
Boeing receives record order of $18 billion
Emirates is ordering 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777s, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big transaction when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 aircraft amounts to a record $18 billion.
It is as big as the place from which Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft for their dollar value – 50 double-aisle Boing 777 jets.
The successful order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
Then on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is over a billion dollars.
“This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing,” Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but a rise in fuel prices – usually detrimental to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs – is not so detrimental, because the country is making money with the rise in the price of oil.
That’s important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the widebody aircraft market and helps keep at bay its competitor Airbus SAS’ attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing’s win at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's President's Sister Apparently Defeated in Michoacán Vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the race for governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the state's violent election, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the Western state’s governorship race to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the entire country," Luisa Maria Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... They seized the ballot boxes, set up barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly overtaken Calderon, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderon, a candidate from his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, came third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureole also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive aimed at smugglers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, no matter how unpleasant the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, facing next year."
AfDB urges Asia to help bail out eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would hamper growth in Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two largest, fastest-growing economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the economic bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries observing Europe’s difficulties in an “impartial” way and said Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avert a long-term crisis in the global economy.
“We’re all together in this.”
“So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune.”
“So if China and India can help, let it be by all means.”
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has heightened fears that it could push the global economy into recession and has sparked calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as buying bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater bargaining power for Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said “India will do everything possible” to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depletion of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India’s one billion two hundred thousand people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
“At some point they will realize that Greeks are retiring at the age of 50 and going on vacation to the beaches and that will not go well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs at poorly run, loss-generating companies like the railroads.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens to have “significant chain effects” across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces “downside risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon Warnings About Possible Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts looming could undermine national security and provoke a chain financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to Afghanistan’s battlefields, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, a Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican for South Carolina.
He said Congress’ failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its aftermath, the so-called “kidnapping,” would result in 23 percent global cuts and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would make most of our naval and construction projects impossible to execute - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntarily remove many of our civilian officials and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to dismiss civilians in order to meet the target.”
“These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage good disposition.”
The cuts would eventually reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
“While the wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the hijacking, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions to the base budgets,” Panetta warned.
“The hiring of personnel would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract supporting the war.”
“Payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago asking for information about the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Defense Department.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are firmly against this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta’s letter.
“This is not a result with which one can live, and certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly candid about possible cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what might be ahead — an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet-free brigade."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries.”
"In fact, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how the reductions “generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be previously deployed and engaged around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but supporters say it is the vital next step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lying are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Administrators at Pennsylvania State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “picked” with an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a mockery of his denials quickly rebuffed by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been instances where teachers have given exam responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and deceiving are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any given day, studies show that you can be lied to anywhere 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or “locating lies,” is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim, “I have you,” deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been refuted.
Liars look into the eyes.
They don’t always stutter, stammer, blush, or worry.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and timing.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-oriented lies," while women tell more "other-oriented lies" -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they usually tell) tend to be "huge".
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the usual behavior of the subject.
This is called “creating a baseline.”
It helps to provide benchmarks to then measure changes.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
It’s best to know if someone normally kicks all the time so as not to make unfair accusations when you see their feet kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for deceptive, verbal and nonverbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as warning signs, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze their upper body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a “post-interview relief” — that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Often interrogators falsely make it appear that the interview is over just to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject’s vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up to the bottom and used the past while claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: “I didn’t have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I can... to my understanding."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a wake-up call.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial Pipeline Plan Deflected After Threat of U.S. Delay in Approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico — infuriating unions, while appeasing environmentalists — the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada executive Alex Pourbax says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it does have a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are studied that avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast groundwater supply.
“This is a real road to progress,” Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may set aside any decision until 2013, after next year’s election, though officials denied the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed his full support to them.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project posed only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada’s hired lobbyist Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to direct the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims disco diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her little daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's diatribe scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10th of last year when tramboy Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk walked down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, carrying her luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
“Someone came up from behind and said, ‘You know what your daughter is doing?’ I said, ‘Yes,’ and I went to get her,” he said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, 'I shouldn't have left your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
“I said, ‘I have no interest in what you say or think.’
He became angry and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J aloud...
I had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle on me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,'" the girl's mother said.
LaBelle rushed over the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and pulled back to a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard she threw up, he added.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a support association for children with cancer.
“The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,” Davis said.
“That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when you address a kindergarten teacher who is carrying an 18-month-old child in her arms.”
Climate Adversity Has Slowed the Economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa, unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has fallen and the economy has contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to causing million-dollar losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the frost damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares were damaged, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment in the state during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 people from Sinaloa were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter it was 5.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been taken by public policy.
“What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who grab dollars in an illicit way it is not easy for them to work them, invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Migration Detained
López Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
“The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entering, and secondly because entering have also many difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being paid as a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the labor lags of the state are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the largest decrease in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June, the state FDI totaled $ 630,697, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143,312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the state government requested in July to the state congress the approval of a loan for 3 billion pesos, same that would be destined the investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the purpose of reviving the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2,600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of the indebtedness in any sector of the economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensely to recover the ground that we lost in this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, it was missing to align the effort of all and above all the good march already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic Slowness
Loredo López said events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year halted the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers’ Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that it is necessary to prosecute the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
Work to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better guides the Government’s efforts.
"In general terms I would say that the government has been striving to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He was convicted of 8 kilos of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney General’s Office reported that the sentenced narcomanuist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narco-menuist was riding in a white pickup truck, carrying a black bag in the car box and a small backpack in the co-pilot’s seat, where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was placed at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person continues to be interned in the Center for the Enforcement of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Must contribute to works
Works of a social nature contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda.
The director of municipal Social Development indicated that although so far the work programs have advanced, they are at risk because the State Government has not complied with the contributions that correspond to them, which add a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State is responsible for 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these becomes effective.
"They are almost 12 million what they have to contribute and although the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part," he said, "we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not provide on that occasion.
"It already happened to us in the previous six years because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the State left pending," he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he said that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them arrive as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million what they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth."
Corte validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, because they did not meet the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft ruling, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favor of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the demand lodged by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
“I also do not consider that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal Executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the State rectory.
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and it translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of state economic rectory, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the state executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, invades in some way the sphere of competence of the Congress, since the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative is being provided in the administrative sphere, he said.
They analyze the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP the difference between first and second place of the election of governor is just 27 percent, still without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes.
The possibility of the "vote for vote" count is a reality as far as this year's electoral process in Michoacán is concerned, where according to data released by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is just 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize the local norms with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to enter into force in the current electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines provided for in the Law of the Official State Newspaper, with the argument of
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislature and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state president to constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may take place in the event that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and counting in the file of the box or does not operate in the possession of the president of the same; or, when there are errors or obvious alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the polling stations may be carried out when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate who won the election in question and the one who obtained the second place in the poll is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that applied for the second of the nominated candidates.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the ordinary count it is established that the difference between the candidate allegedly winning and the one in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate was in second place, in which case the electoral packages that have been subject to partial count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, during Monday, reconnaissances and a requiem mass were held.
According to his relatives, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving a tribute from the other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés’ family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attending the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At twelve noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel of vigil located on the boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends were arriving.
At 5:30 in the afternoon he was given a recognition at the Saltillo Technological Institute organized by his former colleagues from the Technological Baccalaureate and the American Football Team, of which Felipe Bacio was part during his baccalaureate preparation.
"His will was that he return to Saltillo and that his ashes be scattered in the mountain range of Zapalinamé, he always expressed this to his family and friends", this was made known by Sandra Bacio Cortés sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, she considers that she was in the fullness of her life, "he was a successful man, extraordinary as a father, as a son, a loving brother and the pendent of his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Colegio del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said that he even got dizzy in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "he was barely in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopán for the graduation of his family, that is why he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: flying an aircraft.
Give him the last goodbye
With honors was fired the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, in tribute that led the governor Jorge Torres López, and that gave him people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, managers and students of the Technológico de Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and stood out in the sport.

Three abandoned bodies found in Cadereyta NL farm
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in an abandoned estate of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by observed that in the fifth, whose fence is beige with coffee, was the gate open wide.
Looking inward, about three meters, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately gave notice to the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark denim trousers, without shoes; next to him was another with a white t-shirt with straps.
A mere meter away was the body of another individual in a red t-shirt and blue denim pants.
The three of them were upside down.
According to data obtained at the site, the three people were reportedly killed elsewhere, as no caps were found at the site.
In the barda of the fifth can be seen legends that are directed from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
Captured 11 in Cadereyta
The Secretariat of National Defense presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, murders, "halcone" and clandestine burials.
According to the information released, in a first event on November 11 in the colony Los Alveros eight people were detained and one who remained deprived of his freedom was rescued.

In marking the stop and conducting the inspection, the military found a long gun, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and following these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested in the ejido La Frauda, who on seeing the military tried to flee.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put that country on the verge of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with Italy's president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the verge of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to introduce a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his bid to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The “framework is now well outlined,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration headed by former EU commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain hit-and-run confidence in Italy.
Underlining pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability put the performance of Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of the Italian employers' union Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocrat-majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
On Monday, Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations.
It will end its round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would step down, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his administration should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before he advances the elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist it should be made up only of technicians, a sign of his fears over a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of the Spaniards is superior to that of the tics
Of the 22 footballers named from Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 convoked reached the 50 matches.
A capital contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today’s friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the Estadio Nacional de San José.
While the world and European champions, number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, have an extensive record of A-Class cross-season games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have all 50 international matches.
That figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain a year intense activity in league championships and domestic cup, and high-level clashes in European cups such as Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers of the Euro and the World Cup.
Ticos footballers, on the other hand, have limited international friction in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish national team is the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationals.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain steering wheel, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke ram, Raúl González, with 102.
Near the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tic-toe side, and close to Michael Umaña, are left-back Junior Diaz, with 48 presences and gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five beat the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest aren't nearing 8:00.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain's historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records more with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country on its two-decade-long celebratory tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assures that for them too will be turning into reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was assured by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and on Sunday 20th it will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day they will perform at the Estadio Nacional, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with the angelina band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is in The Nation on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican fans, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have been in Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to stay a few days there.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What do you say to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the last 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We’re really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; this is how we learned, through people who love surfing.
Watching the tour, they’ve been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's the reason for this?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything they’ve achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
“First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined we’d be in a great rock band and having done it for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love creating music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge?
It’s always been an honor to be part of that big band.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is something uncommon.
From time to time, a band from a city emerges, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with all of them still and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that emerged.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
Firstly, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you don’t be on tour too much because it’s easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without getting tempted to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and it was great at first.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the amazing person Andy was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to his mind.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first ones I think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s something wonderful because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that might seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs though they may sound a little bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, undoubtedly, represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted Tuesday to a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he has in his legs, his GP said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his administration (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a cancer of the tongue for which he has been operated on four times and which he remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He was operated on four times for cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies have been added such as severe erosive gastritis, cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving incarceration since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "proper for the exchange of information on all that are political issues between the two nations", as published by the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to get out of the "gray list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed by countries that did not implement all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004 that has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
The mustache plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tirelessly, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before had he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the outset to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the use of glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the head of specialized press at Nintendo in Spain, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez noted that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally intended for that support", as hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the more experienced will be able to give a "second turn" to the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that was not produced since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo nods to the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous installments, consisting in that the plumber of the mustache will have to travel platforms mined with dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a Luigi "playable".
Colom backs Portillo’s extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has proceeded with the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to the United States to answer for the $70 million laundering conspiracy.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and executive powers, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
During his tenure, he said, he "did not get his hands on" court decisions and proceeded with all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did was an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional bodies had been exhausted to prosecute the former president between 2000 and 2004.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has settled his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor’s Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the drop in the marginality of untrained children
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter century.
Added to this are the hundreds of jobs currently created for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held in the former factory complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of degradation or in a situation of falling into marginalization.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unity of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former socialist education councillor, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current ecosocialist councillor Ricard Gomà attended the event.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the large hall of La Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is too, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Evicted an occupied estate where macrofestivals were held
The invaders had seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the neighbors of 51 de la calle de Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday noon the property they were illegally occupying, and where they were organizing macro parties that despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was over, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
“From now on there will be an access control,” the administrator said.
The squats, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building -the rest are inhabited-, took away all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowded parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the disco says that the invaders of the estate made unfair competition, since they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the disco they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had had to respond to complaints about noise, while, according to him, the inconvenience was caused not by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, by the attendees of the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The head of the club explained that the inconvenience was so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago he "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had last week called for "immediately evict the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that produce neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and in almost all the floors, and in some there have even been robberies.
In this sense, he added that, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivility that has been generated in the estate."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. police headed to 35 rue de Mont-ral after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed four people entering the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies about fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional pasquines of Collserola.
The booklet defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What’s more, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park once again became, in the imagination of many, the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park reflects this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
These were until, in September, the city council called a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for as many gateways to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone intends to put doors in the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it supposes of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It’s almost already a recurring theme when two members of this ancient caste of chosen ones recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel M<0xC3><0xB2>dol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to discuss "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is fitting to start from the basis that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things because of its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, "says the architect for whom the title of "doors of Collserola" encloses a "lexical trap": we should not think of them "as accesses to a park, but the delimitation of areas where you have to act".
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainty that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum "su canto del cisne".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
“To limit something is to fix already the next step,” that is, its overtaking.
"We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can give rise to real disasters."
More limited to the question, M<0xC3><0xB2>dol thinks that, simplifying, the Valls slope of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a purely topographical question.
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not fall into disrepair", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers his guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe passage that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he points out) that have had to create: "Architects should be just a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest there is a lack of a global vision of Collserola: "There have been called 16 cross-sectional contests -he says- in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the door next door.
In his opinion, however, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that will make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and will go free
After 72 days of rooting, the legal representative of Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted him a pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which is pursuing a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonás demanded the payment of an economic fee for the regiomontano city council to allow the clandestine operation of the bookmaker.
After the public complaint, the state prosecutor’s office opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panista mayor and on September 2 he was arrested and held for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor’s Office 3 in Property Crimes, he was transferred to the Casa de Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days after a second injunction was issued after the Public Prosecutor ' s Office dismissed the bribery and organized crime offences.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereyta prison for allegedly blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with 1.5 million pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the medium-security prison since death threats existed against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial interned in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was given an arrest warrant by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, enough evidence was verified to determine Jonás’ guilt, such as the charge of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the royal mayor; so in the coming hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the Public Prosecutor’s Agent attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011 the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and henceforth no claim can be filed around the process that was followed; in addition to that he will not be required reparation for damages or punishment.
After the hearing with the legal representative of the bookmaker, at about 15:50 Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonás that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Perez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretary of Communications and Transportation (SCT) reported that the results released on the accident where the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter was hit directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot could attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees 25 meters away where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations made in the area of the impact are not reported the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search that there are no parts or components of the spacecraft elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain presents a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary said it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation can last several months, even could reach a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was operating at cruise speed and that this happened in soft uphill terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aeronautical regulations the flight was carried out under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
The reports in the AICM located suitable conditions for take-off, as the aircraft advances towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico there were cloud layers at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloudy conditions the crew has sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last radar aircraft record coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a small area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and sideways trajectory.
The debris scattering pattern of the aircraft allows to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the accident there is still no evidence of any kind of explosion or fire in the wreckage of the ship.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the fieldwork, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above average sea level, the terrain presents a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it predictably disjointed along that path.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the cordoned off site around the crash, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the presumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security Leads Research to Discover Obesity Gene in Children and Young People; Supported by IPN Specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the protocol 'Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity', which will allow to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital de Especialidades of the National Medical Center Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, the population is invited to participate, whether or not they have the right, to go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests are carried out on minors, every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Mexico State West) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Mexico State East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Unidad Deportiva Independencia (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Unidad Deportiva Morelos (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
Celebrating World Diabetes Day on November 14, he said the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on diet.
They will also be asked about physical activity and hereditary family history of disease, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure measurements, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (they seek to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) are applied to all participants.
Cruz López pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
"The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, there was also a dramatic increase," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for the markers is based on the fact that the population of the country differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows detecting if they are overweight or obese.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) on the neck and forearm, indicating the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors deliver it in writing to parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting most of the day in front of the television and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, that is, the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high content of fats and proteins and the genetics that is analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt from UNAM would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 bumps each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate, the bumps could be completely reduced or eliminated in quantity.
In his conference A technological opinion of the potholes, issued within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, revealed that the laboratory in charge develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees centigrade it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that on the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warned the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
As vehicles transit and efforts are generated, this allows the forces to diffuse very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On top of the asphalt binder, he abounded, is placed a last layer called rolling binder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the efforts, the rolling folder also requires to have the proper thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it considerably affects the performance of the asphalt binder.
When the soil is moistened, the water diffuses inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of bumps.
In the process of forming a bump, he said, the first to wear out is the rolling film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantaneously, but it is a process that should be attended to at the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of bumps and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always be in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is met, to avoid frequent bumps.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to research and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair bumps easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate of the Valley lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of princess.
Once again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire for the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico rose with the crown and the sceptre, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina to the legion of Caucasian women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Alejandra (1949), Alejandra (1989), Alejandra (1989), Alejandra (1990), Alejandra (1990), Alejandra (1990), Alejandra (1990), Alejandra (1990), Alejandra (1990), Alejandra (1990), Alejandra (1990), Alejandra (1990).
Today the big question that many ask themselves is What was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision made by the jury to designate her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why?" made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
To the questioner the Vallecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way to culturalize, I definitely think the book that marked me as a child is 'The Little Prince', it's a pretty deep book.
I am currently reading Crime and Punishment, a book of universal literature that we should all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book called The Burning of Blood.
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalize" and second by not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise whatever has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota insinuated that being the favorite, the cheered and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best artisan costume, and Reina Madre), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that is why she did not shine on the stage."
And that was noticed in his first swimsuit performance at the Hilton Beach and his two parades at the coronation evening.
Although she looked safe in both, it was noticed that she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Como en casa" program on Canal RCN, said that the fact that Melina was nominated as a princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain a queen".
In addition, Valle was at last very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For some reason, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, that before entering the Competition they are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for his defects in the back and the fibrosis that was noticed in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The queen trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, lowered her points on the last day".
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the Vallecaucana were the surgical interventions that were performed.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her stronghold and here she was taken.”
For this award, which for the first time gives the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit a cruel prediction emerged that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contention that Raymundo granted to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that today Melina begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was dodged the crown.
This was the work of the Caleño who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lophoscopist from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", through the comparison of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists who work in the section of the CTI, that week was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to stay for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to wear clothes minimum for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the world’s oldest guerrilla, so they asked him to carry Guillermo León Sáenz’s decadal card (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the corpse was, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But the footprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those of the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the top leader of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a dactylographer of the Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can become key in resolving crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identities of captured people.
When captured, many criminals present false ballots or have no papers.
We take their fingerprints and look them up in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, it was up to him to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to make a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the crime scene.
A CTI fingerprinter explained that in the objects "the fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or ribbon is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI TV show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes imprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective comparison is made.
The “outraged” defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part of them responded to the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied New York authorities Tuesday as they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square, where they were evicted early in the morning, under a court order, and attempted to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded the Zuccotti square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the "indigned" to camp back in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to re-camp in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for Occupy Wall Street.
Bray said the “outraged” response to the eviction of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignados" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to detain some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled in that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square - which is a privately owned enclosure - remains closed awaiting the holding of a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation must be analyzed this morning.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed at this time copies of that court order and even delivered them to the agents who guarded the square, which caused "some small clashes", said Bray, who denounced that some officers beat the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing “laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that due to the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, warning them, however, that local laws do not allow them to resettle with tents and sleeping bags.
The councilor personally defended the early morning eviction of Piazza Zuccotti, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people," as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
“This morning’s eviction was disgusting and shows that at the bottom Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers,” a spokesperson for the movement added, accusing the mayor of “disrespecting freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they plan to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months-long protests, which began Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement," lifeguard on "Baywatch," bunny from "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other Canadian stars, will appear on the December 1 TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" bringing to life a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a pornographic home video in which she appears along with her then-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" drummer, Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as host in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a “slut” during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescent by the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe suffered by the country since World War II.
The Tokyo Government's first estimates put material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have subsided.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the data of the Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn the page, definitely: the GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - is also the fastest pace of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the rebound in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructures, to use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has aroused, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge values" chosen by the investors who flee from the crisis of debt in the euro area and the turbid forecasts of the USA, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products become more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic buoyancy line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the price of the yen.
As markets continue their siege of the EU’s peripheral countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda does not let down its guard.
"We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator anticipating tipping points in the global economy highlighted that major powers are slowing down.
As it fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone was even below the average, which is at level 100, by precipitating eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens has raised doubts again.
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives won’t sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums skyrocketing and uncertainty reinstated in the parquet floors, Greece continues to entangle in the maze leading to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed on in his appointment may be shortened to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said, opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new government.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear the doubts about his stance: “We have committed ourselves to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else.”
The conservative leader went a step further on his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the $8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his assent to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still shocked by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what it takes to pay the sixth tranche" of $8 billion, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek skein still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant place worldwide in the role of Microfinance".
The Queen recalled yesterday that the country has become in these last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" he said lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with the horizon 2015, and, "very especially, in that which has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people living with fixed incomes below one dollar per day".
Spain "continues working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate in the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are “many achievements achieved” and “many challenges we face.”
The Microcredit Summit is presented not only as a forum for discussion, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that 100 million of those households will leave the poverty line in which they are immersed.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighting Doña Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
She described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all of them I have been able to see the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "family head" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to epochs of economic bonanza, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said that microcredits are "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it fall victim to the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluded to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, went without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially included on the agenda, but the issue was raised in the fall, in particular to satisfy militants who consider that the government’s policy is currently too loose with the Greeks and could be too loose with the Italians in the future.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in one motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open a path in Europe".
This could be manifested in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to allow the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the 27 will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm the mood within her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it is not that she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or the countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a section to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except in passing.
Two centuries ago there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and give a speech on the issue, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the will to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of absence on private sector workers before it can take the cut.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on civil servants a day of absence without remuneration in case of absence from work (so far, they do not have a lack, compared to the three days that are applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, most of them are also bringing the issue of fraud back to the table, this time oriented towards the abuses of the loss of work.
"The controls are going to be considerably increased and, in addition, if someone is found committing a fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned speaking on the RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear slightly disproportionate to the reality of labour loss fraud.
In fact, since 2002, this issue has been constantly monitored and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have normally borne fruit.
The French do not get sick any more than in the rest of Europe.
Let us first look carefully at the national figures.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), in 2006 more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million was paid in benefits for loss of employment.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, subsidies for casualties accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this sum, 46% corresponds to maternity leave and work accidents, while 54% is related to sick leave, which amounts to 6.2 billion euros.
This represents 2.5% of health care spending.
In 2010, French people took an average of 14.5 days off work, up from 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of the sick leave had a duration of less than 8 days, 22% of between 8 and 14 days, 15% of between 15 days and one month, 15% of between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, compared to 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% to 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The reinforcement of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were considered to be “duely adapted or unjustified; a figure that, with a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who have taken sick leave.
Undoubtedly an insignificant figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenues of between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion a year, that is, more than the total cost of allowances for casualties and, without a doubt, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared to Parliament on Monday, 14 November. He also added that the hundred days granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve this objective.
"In order to make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budget adjustment," said the head of the government, who gave his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's permanence in the euro area is "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, Papadémos has forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced "up to about 9%" of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to further austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favor of new measures," he said during a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy party.
He noted that he agreed with the targets of deficit and debt reduction, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that impedes the economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties’ support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
Expert Committee Says Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide Should Be Legalized
Canadians live denying death, says Royal Society of Canada report
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society continues to deny death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions they want to die in and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient considers such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent Economist Intelligence Unit survey that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the issue of death.”
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that did not agree with the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Penal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more excesses in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal."
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, since they believe it would allow people whose death is near to ease their suffering, according to a survey by Angus Reid conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41 per cent of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, its recommendations suggest that the Criminal Code should state that the withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for training health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses care at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in health institutions in Canada, the committee calls for it, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, to be considered euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts signing the report "extreme", among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill people.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide,” said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value in society.
However, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called a “manifesto in favor of euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, especially calls into question the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President Assad to Drop Power
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria Is Increasingly Isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria of Bashar Assad intensified, who, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, have spoken out in favor of President Assad’s abandonment of power.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "abandon power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Turkey’s mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime had failed.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
Following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States welcomed the “strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime.”
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" regarding the repression in Syria, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already been killed in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians have been killed "during shelling and heavy machine gun shootings in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, the NGO said.
During a press conference, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid Al Mualem, considers for his part that the country "is moving towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which it considers to be "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not weaken,” he added, guaranteeing that “the plots plotted against Syria will fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, also expressed his support for the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which, in his opinion, is locked in “paranoia”.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the plan for exiting the crisis adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from cities held by the opposition and the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Arab League's decision was "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to exit the crisis, although it did not express its support for the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with political parties and met today with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of a broad program with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a deputy from one of the numerous small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the President-designate of the Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he hopes that Mario Monti will request a vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new government has enough support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for forming a government and preparing its program, he said, adding that he is "sure that the markets will have patience and understand it".
His nomination by the President initially garnered market approval, but later worries prevailed, particularly after an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The designated Prime Minister should create a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include “politicians.”
The new government should operate until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence of Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work with the urgency and with the aim that Italy "recovers its prominence" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a balanced budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for the adoption of new rigorous measures.
Italy's "head of the bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on the mattes, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow cannot meet the deficit requirements."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put some <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in state bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA said last week it was "seriously concerned" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk, Urals, and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Later, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA notes that there are “clear indications that Iran is developing” a nuclear detonation system “with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as a member state has reported to the Agency, worked for most of his career on such technology in the military nuclear program of his country of origin.”
Crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have declined or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49 per cent, compared to a 13 per cent increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall 14 per cent increase in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and crimes have increased again,” Human Rights First said, “the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant,” the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a senior official at Human Rights First.
“The U.S. government can and should endeavor to put an end to such abuses,” he adds, adding that such efforts could include improving police reports of “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and a so-called "name" tab make it possible to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Tweets", that is, those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they rate a message as a favorite, etc.
Twitter's new formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT para reenviar un mensaje de otra persona, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the insiders, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users have debated at the stroke of "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” writes <0x40>jemb123.
“The Activity feature is going to help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed,” writes <0x40>dannykronstrom.
Austrian
Introduction of a "golden rule" in the Constitution
Austria's ruling Social Democratic/Christian Democrat government decided on Tuesday to include a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution to reduce the public deficit and thus prevent a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign rating by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure much higher than the ceiling of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were to be reduced by a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, vice-chancellor of the Christian Democratic Party for Foreign Affairs.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the member countries of the euro area last October 26: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of the public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law of equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government approximates the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Before 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states, as well as the communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, the public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
It's a very strong yen
Noda threatens new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we see that there is excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the all-time highs that resulted in the intervention of Japanese authorities on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been gradually rising since then, driven by purchases from investors who consider it a “safe haven” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and Europe’s debt crisis.
The dollar traded again on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic 105 yen bar, reaching levels close to those triggered by the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency hurts the archipelago’s exports, as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the revenues earned abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern Tohoku region, Noda said, fearing the rising yen cut roots the weak recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption by households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “the right steps,” implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by 5 trillion yen (47 billion euros), bringing to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of funds it dedicates to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
The euro area:
the types grow, the bags weaken
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the most weakened countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro zone, European stock markets plunged a bit further into the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and stood at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given the new tensions in relation to the borrowing yields of the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down 0.7%, renewing market participants’ concerns about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes fixed on Europe and exchanges will continue to be conducted on a narrow margin of variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, for the option of a country in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish 10-year bonds offered 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his Government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while on Sunday the legislative elections will be held there.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Awaiting the growth figures of the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a figure more favorable than the 0.3% forecast, driven by domestic consumption.
The INSEE, however, has revised down the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts are worth more than dogmas.
If there’s one issue that can’t be addressed with short-term considerations or just thinking about emotions, it’s energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an election meeting should be a time for reflection on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will mean that electricity demand will double by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources will have to be alleviated in order to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case either in Belgium, which subjects its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or in Switzerland, which aims only to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such a discourse.
The choice of Berlin will mean an increase in the price of electricity, a greater dependence on energy due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the detrimental effects will be noticed.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
Champion of Europe in the wind sector, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would imply a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would detract from the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express opposition by principle to this type of energy, polls show.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 managerial jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs that specialize in international markets and can create non-delocalizable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros a year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-CO2 solutions, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, the Three Mile Island, was produced under normal operating conditions; it had no consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, just as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is being studied by all the electrical actors who wish to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free to assume the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized starting from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the 23 May newspaper Libération) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take on all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and right shared the fear of an invasion of the national territory by a crowd of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande merely includes banalities, indicating that co-development will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may prove electorally profitable, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and hurts employment.
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that immigrants can replace national workers, particularly low-skilled workers, by pushing for wage cuts.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact complementary rather than substitutes for national workers and are mainly employed in unemployed sectors.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthetists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the wages and employment of nationals.
Considering the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows means a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to the public budgets on average over his or her lifetime.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that he lacked "with his teeth".
Those teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, all it needs to think about is a European democracy
Democracy is a precious but fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote as directly as possible.
We know from Napoleon the Little that it was a thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough in itself and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence needs to be addressed in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer advancing in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a stop to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take blows of effect, but a common, full-fledged exercise, calm and continuous, of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that is following the orders of the markets and rating agencies, that is suffering from their helplessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
Getting out of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
Interest-driven revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a true European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us make Europeans.
Cards with "contactless" chips are generalized
The global chip card show kicks off on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations of the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is the non-contact technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units) and account for about 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large surfaces work by four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To put the upper gear, however, it is necessary for the banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two large French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically distributing contactless bank cards among their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks try out mobile phone payment
But it is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, indispensable for carrying out transactions.
"They're lagging behind."
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We anticipate that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold in 2012 worldwide,” said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Societe Generale has also said yesterday that it is preparing the commercialization of an offer that will allow its customers to pay contactlessly through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about ties between al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which were long suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already “has the certainty”.
“The way both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show they are cooperating,” he said, without elaborating.
Paris seems to have come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the catwalks.
Abducted in a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially captured the interest of the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, allegedly, is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait until we have more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these “supports” had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex and of the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since pressured Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as an illuminated community unworthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants launch themselves into the struggle against the ungodly central government.
The latter are oriented in the first place to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuya’s reaction was, as it usually happens, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuja, in particular the police’s protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, ranging from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is a concern for all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information.”
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates are making more and more thunderous statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strength of Republicans.
They spread the slogans, often unfounded, about China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the Grand Old Party nomination, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them “for manipulation of their currency,” a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that implies the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly drowns in an attitude that “overwhelms” emotions.
He has called for a firm, but constructive, dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the Reagan style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear program.
“If I’m elected, I’ll stop Iran,” he said.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also pledged to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed with his obligations in relation to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, shows an embarrassing ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing “attempts to develop nuclear capability,” apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq and on their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it as weak.
But attacks are not easy for them.
The population judges Obama’s national security balance sheet rather positively, which ended Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he distrusts military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia via the Baltic Sea floor, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year to Western Europe through a first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 to supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the passage over land by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close off its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, given that the project has generated a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in making its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, large gas consumers and increasingly limited reserves, a reality.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically unites us," Fillon said during the pipeline's inauguration, demonstrating how big gas contracts are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom managers, numerous in Lubmin, at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extreme measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden’s waters, but project managers gave up on it because the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state company to settle permanently at sea off its shores.
“In the event of a breakdown, we will interrupt the gas flow in less than a minute,” Müller said.
In the event of a leak, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, since they have foreseen joints that are forecast to leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, entrained by a ship, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to the company, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, all of the gas transport capacities.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” Müller said.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been carried out in 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and in 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of spending.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the exit door of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to German gas pipelines.
Since Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore people’s taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch on the market a notebook of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the benches.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists up to the 20th century, to today’s taste,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand’s head of Modo Modo.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the early years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed, has remained a long way off.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded, and cultured.
The small Italian company, which had twelve employees in its inception, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard lids, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: handbags, agendas, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th Employment Week for the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled persons doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
"No," says Eric Blanchet, managing director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the last fifteen years is considerable.
“At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a lot to be done."
Disabled unemployed persons continue to face numerous obstacles to accessing employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 (average 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not completed high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it especially difficult to return to work and that "constitute the crux of the problem," says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; people’s mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entrepreneure for the Cité pointed out that the directors surveyed have “a low level of knowledge about disabilities”, with an “excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectually disabled”.
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the target of hiring 6% of disabled workers, an objective that was set in a law of 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "submitted to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created a lot of pressure for companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 employees have disabled employees in their workforce, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly game generates for them.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the platform of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker’s gesture of resentment against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian."
“I want to move forward,” the Lille striker replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, "it is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I'm all year round, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
“I have to sit down.”
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Not to mention the “pleasure.”
He has been cheering for the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been his fan,” he says.
This will undoubtedly reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
“We just faced up recently.
“Playing against them is always a joy.”
With simplicity, Leekens has for his part made reference to "pride".
"Pride" for playing "a gala game".
"Proud" also to prove, as a "neighbor", that France "returns to a very high level team", nearly a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You'll be able to see him in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Portugal's Paulo Bento faces optimism in the return match against Bosnia (22:00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first half, both teams lacked realism.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it; the Selecçao, which has been leading since September 2010, is going to qualify for Euro 2012.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a match to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the one-way match (0-0), on Friday in Zenica’s hell, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given him peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home."
But at home, in the bright Stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is evident that the match "is very equal", said an optimistic but lucid Benedict.
"We hope the match will be very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in the Euro 2012", said the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forced the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home," Bento regrets.
"We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "don't leave them time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
