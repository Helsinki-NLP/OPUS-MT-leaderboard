The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s stock trades reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday’s fall when it fell to about 6 percent.
The fall this time is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
Also here is the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives who refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector.
Falling shares in Asia
Asian stocks fell sharply on Tuesday, though the index eventually mitigated some of the losses throughout the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Stock Exchange index over its financial day stood at nearly four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that tracks Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, with Shanghai markets closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the Index secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The planned rescue actions in the U.S. are unsafe and this influences the financial markets around the world,” said the head of the Hong Kong Mint, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the drops will be felt in other countries.
The Bloody Bath of American Stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the $700 billion (almost 12 trillion crowns) plan to help the financial system.
Lawmakers, in that way, ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to nearly seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index fell before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly’s proposal did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: U.S. Government May Inject $700 Billion Into Banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
Its vote will take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers sparked a rift in talks about approving the bailout in the form of aid to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law public and vote on it.
The plan to help the financial system will be discussed Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
He told Reuters on Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee for Financial Services and Assembly Banking.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate no earlier than Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the bailout plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Afterwards, however, "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market aid will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a great breakthrough.
We resolved our disagreeing views regarding the form that the package of measures for market stabilization should take," Democrat Nancy Pelosia told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives from lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy from financial corporations the unsold mortgage assets that lead financial firms to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
It’s still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we’re already on it,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is expressly affecting the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to finally pass a deal on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors’ businesses in the face of the Asian finance market since these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear about when the two chambers of Congress will vote and, even if they will not stall at the last moment with some problem.
Lawmakers believe it will be passed in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be made available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was retained, which consisted of earning financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying off their mortgages.
“We have worked everything.
The House of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Sen. Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is pleased with Saturday’s advance and that he values “the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy.”
Limitation of armored contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said lawmakers had decided on the liability of the program’s money to protect taxpayers’ taxes from their losses, an alleviating closure of the planned finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the companies participating in the program, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it, and we’ve made a big step toward the agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly burdens of debtors’ installment payments and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but rather difficult.
“And that’s why it’s not known by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, as relevant.
"Much more important is that, already this week, congressmen agree on his support and give him their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to get that approval is, at the moment, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Armed Fighting: The MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are sufficient reasons for man to acquire only the reproductor.
The choice depends practically on the way of its use and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for you to acquire the most modern record player to listen to in it the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP records no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music are crowded on your shelves, you are probably dreaming at least of this type of turntable.
This is the same with music that is on its way, that is, compressed, simplified music - music in MP3.
And here there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try the helmets of a market of twenty crowns.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also decides the battery life
Some of the best players achieve much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobile phones.
No device today is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elementary functions such as telephone, send messages, can play music and video, record both, has a better or worse camera and can even get to navigate.
And when we take into account the Smartphone and the PDAs will have in their pocket also a small computer.
This is a small miracle since no refrigerator knows how to make a barbecue and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile the sooner the display indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy swallows.
There are few mobile phones that can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play for more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top of it, constantly call still get, for more safety, a charger for work - this is also true for the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have, because even the worst endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem happens when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only on some readers without reduction can be connected the small memory cards that are used on mobiles.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Just fill the device with music via the USB of the computer.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library based on the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment, be interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its operation.
If you listen, above all, to music in the background and listen to it every day just for a while, like on the tram, then any mobile you play is enough.
This is something that virtually any mobile phone can achieve.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and practically all the music that comes to you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The minus ones include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and your iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough to visit the relevant pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album through the mobile internet.
This service could by itself be a weighty argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is miserable and most are limited only to the fleeting success themes of the radios.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you will find the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use a built-in player that has virtually every mobile even if it’s at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the lack of an input for classic headphones.
The best, even when it comes to the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are really handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, its handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the turntables is evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account for data download.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (for example, the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card you will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped only with a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself one of the most demanding music lovers, take advantage of the most specialized walkman-mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose phones of the walkman line have almost identical use as that of a standalone MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over four thousand crowns, but with a greater capacity of memory (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand cited more arria brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not going to be long.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunication Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the whole of the Union.
After the European Commission’s latest steps in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to emerge – for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper than if sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
In contrast, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, has already stated that there is no longer a place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a marked decrease in prices to which the classical operators had to react also.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
There is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
After only half a year, this operator managed to get more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the Penta group that, besides that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual traders is the ability to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large expenses in construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world these types of virtual operators are usually outlined with low costs - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that however, are often countered with the offer of tighter services.
Thus, for example, Tesco mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half cheap compared to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to bet on a trivial goal group.
This operator specifically targets man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – it’s the operator he likes and who he can trust,” says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works for this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept like that of Poland could hook up in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be any virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, told mobile.cz.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not lean towards this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in this, in order to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have managed to advance the meetings," said the group's spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe better times flash.
It seems that, according to unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, a spokesman for Telefónica O2, told mobil.cz.
Other operators are concerned with the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional conformity with O2’s opinion, adds: “To date we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop.”
He adds: “On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that it would be possible to study in such a short horizon."
Vodafone focuses on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of sharing costs and infrastructure.
Precisely we consider it as the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on mobile.”
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a drop in prices and with it, a decrease in profits.
So why facilitate entry into the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the company T-Mobile.
This is attested by the public information accessible on the websites of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: “Moreover, not long ago the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
As regards the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would entail for him and, above all, for his services large requirements."
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Bids (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, she expressed her typical stance on this issue.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator was closed.
To date, no agreement has been concluded as the offer from potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for classical operators," added Kristian Chalupa, from the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS Department of Foreign Affairs, to our question.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that must represent the interests of consumers this is more than a consideration, apart from that they must note that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Overseas where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the lower prices of mobile phone services"
Obviously, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market means and the fall in prices do not fall within the interest of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Really the dramatic shock in this whole case lies in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, offers itself.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
“The Office has found no signs of unfair competition in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have a corresponding rise of responsibility in their actions in the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as are telecommunication regulators,” Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of conflict.
Obviously there is a relevant market analysis prepared by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary the agreement with the administrator of the network.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators are strikingly similarly up.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators there are many similar impediments.
Loading responsibility on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands in this whole matter.
We have met with him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law for the extension of the competence of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the field of commercial tenders was recently introduced, which was not implemented, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
The representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know this perfectly well, but it is clear that their interests lie elsewhere.
All is well, when no one looks
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator still operates unnoticed, a few of which already exist in Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, only a part are public.
These are usually companies that engage in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a select few get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases like the ones you cite were discovered, it could be a breach of the terms of the contract that could result in the end of the collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrová replied to the question about this problem.
But it’s quite unlikely that such activity by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make nothing negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns us of possible problems: "the law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have it at all as a normal customer of the carriers."
Precisely this is what should seem to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> minimally strange.
There is also a new question for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators turn their eyes on this type of procedure, why are they blocking the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it should not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we cease to be the most expensive
As already made clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decrease in the prices of services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market eventually too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, at this time the regulatory bodies have intervened and in none of the cases have they defended the operators but their customers.
Whether it was with formal measures or informal pressure they managed to create the first virtual operator and with it began to emerge others.
Sadly, the Czech Regulatory Body is passing through this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot fail to be impressed that the confusion of attributions in these cases suits them.
But we don't despair.
If this information behind the scenes is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile market is likely to start moving again.
If any of the operators lets in a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we will perhaps stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the hymn Where, My Home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one a male voice and one a female voice, one with Choir and another instrumental.
The singers are Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremia<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers this Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio has said before that it intentionally chose for the Solos singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with both and then also with the choir to look at the diction so that the text is well understood, so that it has a consonance," he said.
The Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home was first played in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The MHD in Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the history of the Prague Transport Company writes the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at this time by almost one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from January 1, 2009) and simultaneously charge it on their chip card at the infocentres and transport company stalls at the Metro stations, Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>kál, Roztyly, Kot<0xC5><0x88>any, Raj, Kazty<0xC4><0x8D>, and Let<0xC5><0x88>any.
The bonds can be purchased from yesterday online on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce, can definitely start to forget about the ticket stalls in the subway stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to get a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is a window available to passengers with trained staff that helps those interested with the purchase online and also with the recharge of the voucher purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic voucher in the Opencard at the vending machines that are located in some lobby areas of the metro.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket-picking machine and travelers will probably have already noticed them in the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are now five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty,” Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
Using the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card on it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is to say, on the bypass trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 mainly used by the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
"In trains assigned to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the area of the voucher," explained the ticket control, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
Bypass buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver’s locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany him with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the voucher.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drapal said.
Passengers who do not travel on bypass buses and do not remember when the validity of the voucher expires can go to the vending machines where the cards are reloaded.
Here, on the machine screen, they will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudeten demanded in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, presumably, some groups of Sudeten Germans addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
It is the result of the letters that are kept in a private archive and that today are kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "land <0xC5><0xA0>umava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have correctly understood the situation and we truly want your word that American units are arriving on German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators,” the letter reads, signed with a “people who carry the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in their hearts.”
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the South-East Germans presumably represents - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in the brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors plead in the letter to the American president who assumes today and forever <0xC5><0xA0>umava under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way collaborates with the victory of the allies,” the letter reads.
The reason the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals from the “Czech oppressors.”
If the U.S. president presumably doubted this idea of the <0xC5><0xA1>umavos Germans, it would be enough to organize in the <0xC5><0xA1>umavas lands a referendum on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge we have of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some specialists it accurately paints the expectations of the Germans of the southeast of then.
Although the Czech Germans must have intuited minimally that they were going to deal with their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was in the war, as German of Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, enlisted in the Baltic navy.
When at the end of the war the British seized him and placed him in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
“They thought that when they got home, the Czech would do them good,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected that on the basis of the Decrees of Benes they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way we could characterize the emotional campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s office promises to deter drivers from dangerous driving.
The $150 million campaign will be heard on television, radio, film, the internet and in leaflets.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind them that before they start, they fasten their belts.
It wants to raise awareness especially of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and last but not least also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that attack emotions.
And for this we are attested by the "bloody" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written with big letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that man in a moment of misguidance can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to “frighten” viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises to reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers
“For drivers, the sugar and whip system is good.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he passes a red light and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says transport psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án of the Na Homolce hospital.
And that is why an information campaign in the press and mainly negative publicity is necessary, the psychologist specifies.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warned.
Olmert would return nearly all occupied areas in exchange for peace
Israel’s interim government president Ehud Olmert spoke out on the restitution of virtually all the land occupied in 1967, i.e. the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper on Monday.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means we will necessarily have to restore almost all (occupied) land if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“I’m sure we’ll take a little bit of this land, but we’ll have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israel’s lands) because without this there will be no peace,” he said.
He admitted that in the event of restitution East Jerusalem would also be included.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the hill of the Temple, a sacred and historical place" that is located in the interior of the ancient city.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won’t work,” he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
“I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of the Golan Heights withdrawal,” he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to detach themselves from to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement), they will have to detach themselves from the permanent support that Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq provoke.
Questions After the Accident: Are Hostesses on Buses Illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padua we have the question of whether the stewardesses and passengers can move on the bus during the trip.
“If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is opposed to the road traffic law,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the 22-year-old stewardess died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places.
However, the bus may have an accident or suddenly stop, and in the exact moment when the steward delivers the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no places to go on foot, which was confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
They finally removed this and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat,” he said.
The hostess does not know the law
“There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess – no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of Vehicle Inspector, whose rights and obligations are not defined," Hanzelka added, less sharply.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the road vehicle traffic department of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law addresses this problem sufficiently.
“It depends on whether the bus has the homologation allowed to have foot sites.
That's all," he says.
The buses are divided between urban ones, where there are standing places and limited maximum speed, interurban ones with standing places with a greater speed permit and those of long distances without places to go on foot, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
BESIP Transportation Safety Expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín sees no major problems with the movement of the steward on the bus.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service on planes.
Not even here is the assurance that the turbulence will come and that the stewardess can hit her head."
"However, if the bus suddenly brakes it is evident that the physical laws are valid.
Same as on a city bus or on the tram.
The safety of the stewardess must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unresolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the service of hostesses.
Employ in it two hundred.
The director, even after the accident, considers that work risky.
"However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess position is risky, then I will suppress it.
The cafe and the newspapers can receive you, the passengers, when you enter.
It would even save expenses,” he says.
In the interest of safety is why Asiana lacks stewardesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have hostesses, we’re against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a deadly accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy
In the accident of the line linking Naples died a young hostess from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he collided with the front right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the flight attendant’s rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl’s family but expects the financial expenses also from the culprit’s side.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the stewardess on the bus in which for a year are working thirty experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusions.
They do not devote themselves too much to buses, but rather to the point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile during the ride," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewardesses to be something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, adding that safety control of buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Occupational Safety.
The hope of Dusseldorf rests in Frankfurt
In the letter of the board of directors of the bank West LB to its collaborators there are no shortage of great words.
By merging the units of the bank of Dusseldorf with the bank DEKA can form 'a central capital market of the financial group of Sparkassen', as the paper says, published on Monday.
Bank West LB, breaking the ‘competition block’ with sustainable profitability would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger can be a start for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how it comes to understand the text, when a board wants to show ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the part of the Federal Institute of Financial Services Surveillance, which has recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the part of Frankfurt, there has been much talk about such a union between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know for its investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of the bank DEKA, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August let it be known that he does not see any sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the board of directors of the DEKA, which is now made up of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, instructed the board to begin negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, so it says on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen area the name of the bank DEKA appears, which with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
At one point in 2003, the situation seemed that DEKA could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was left without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian government spoke out against Helaba’s participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But the idea of a merger of DEKA bank with other regional banks was always played out again.
But lastly Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of Helaba, expressed that he was against plans for coexistence with his bank.
Independent of that it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks of the public law field is necessary.
For, when the Bavarian parliament elections are to pass, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure to continue merging increases, Helaba will lack the partners to achieve that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it has fared much better out of the financial crisis than did the real estate in Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, earlier this year avoided plans for coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end, the West LB can be broken down, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter from the board of directors of the bank it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As you can combine the coexistence between singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that’s going to show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca the third or fourth.
But this time, he is assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows almost 200 Oktoberfest participants what low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 three buses depart, <0x60> towards Munich, the beer party ', expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mostly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing the South Americans, they had already started to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver spikes, owns these buses.
Since five years they come to the Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the road there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the return.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian law of purity, sickness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
By night the buses are already on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Quickly tranquility reigns in the bus, travelers are sleeping.
It's okay, they'll still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates make another stop on Highway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next in Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When the doors of the tent of the countryside are opened, that means to go!”, shouts Marco in the early morning.
"March!" March and occupy the back seats in the campaign tent.
“Don’t take the front seats, because we’re going to block, and everyone in yellow caps don’t sit on the same bench, scattered all over the space!”
A liter of beer, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he gets out of his seat, he'll be busy already!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone is going to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow caps on the trees, road signs and even on a poster of the elections of a large Bavarian People's Party.
We want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There is no exact data on the number of people; it is about 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven policemen of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistic of the nations present, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistances) and Austrians occupy the first place.
The preferred tent of the Italians' campaign is so called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück said just last week.
Good, that the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking field will also be affected by the critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), which is listed on the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to be able to withstand market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The portion of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate will use has to yield interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as from public law banks.
The cause of this is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a brief period – which now, due to mistrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank’s capital reserve in cash fell by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, and the share of equity fell slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continued revenues from financial investments and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, imputation revenues for debtors and some securities also those from the dissolution of provisions from credit businesses tended to fall by more than 70 percent, at 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues from the reimbursements of the compensation expenses of the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the organized businesses for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance could accuse a deficit of about 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financer initially lost himself in speculations about industrial loans for real estate, which served as the reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
Since it was not possible to make much money from the financing of state projects, Defa began to devote itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an “essential material effect” on the group’s consolidated profit and loss account, it is said very vaguely.
It is a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they were cancelled by two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate became a major state financial and infrastructure finance company.
As the bank does not own the client deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year the Hypo Real Estate needs nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion to finance a portion of Defa’s credit portfolios from its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the report of Hypo Real Estate, the bank covers with a credit the need for group financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international money markets that are now essentially not fit to function"
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) are based on the assumption that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That's what the bank's shareholders and creditors have to look forward to.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis, there is no consistency.
It is even conceivable that there is no need for full funding.
But the contrary cannot be excluded.
It was rumored that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so the temporary salvation can not reassure at least concerned people.
The stock price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Loan courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts hardly change, borrowing rates by position on the property registry clearly tend to go down.
The most affected are the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and with good reason the loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were once an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime one can start from the amortization of pensions on time.
Or something is going to happen, which nobody risks imagining – the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross-news about partial nationalization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleep, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put an end to and use the transport to new account of losses for future tax payments of compensation for profits on the exchange in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, had to perform at the Highschool of Tachibana the girls began to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows Mangas' word - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I go by train 40 minutes to Highschool Tachibana.
Alone I had to find the way, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not fixed as rigorously as in my home in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, to nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before class began, I had to introduce myself.
I am also not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt of the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I got to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because I had already started studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have been whispering, laughing and waving and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my mangas.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, cute"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
They all spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the recess everyone pulled out their bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring German pieces of bread.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and something like meat in tofu dough.
In most cases I have no idea what I like here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools bentos are not simply a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in hopes of getting to know him better during a recess.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I’m curious to see if I can see it here too.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for one year.
Then he would always answer:
"Well, because I'm fascinated."
I’ve been reading manga for years.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a bit of Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a skinny by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here although Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can we control whether they, behaving in the same way as us, feel the same way?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years are published the contributions of famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include the questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it makes the dead, runs away or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't believe it.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated by human consciousness with the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short memory and conduct-directing executive functions).
This large part is much more developed in the case of people than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Given at least the aspects related to our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is united with the language, that often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it were, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it analyzed through our experiences, so his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of consenting experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific investigations.
One could investigate the consciousness processes of animals without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short-memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essentials pass rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for visualization formation.
And what does that result for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
Seen from this point of view the sensations are very attached to part of the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature we follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to be able to describe the states of others along with ourselves.
For example Antonio Damasco, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and the brain stem, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brain stem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can absolutely refer to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it not likely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach runs away, then why is it afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That is true that the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the contrary do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can you test it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I would rather investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as long as the same is measured for rats and men.
Since I do not investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move forward than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a test of confidence in Ukraine's ability to host the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is a lot to be done.”
The schedule of construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed," said the president of an association Ukraine Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take our eyes off of us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is “a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules,” Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were convicted because of manipulation in descent to the lower category, finally also the division board had to be postponed.
Counter-attack by Dennis Quaid outraged
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life—and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counter-attacks.
The backward war of the two roses on Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's ex-partner: Eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show a nasty fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was long unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of a marriage's failure is told.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is “unheard-of that Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News.
Among other things, it’s very “unfortunate” that Jack, her 16-year-old son, will again “remember in public the pain and changes, all of which means a divorce for a child.”
While Ryan lives alone after the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently is the father of twins.
And so he ends his statements by emphasizing: "However my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that’s okay.”
Airline and hotel ticket prices are falling
In the first half of 2008 air tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent.
Air tickets and hotel overnight stays were again made cheap - this is the result of a study by the provider of American Express' travel and financial services.
The company has analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the increase in prices in the first quarter it found a big change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays at many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of Europe’s 48 different cities rose on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June, prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar price, which was the cause that “the interests of American tourists in traveling decreased.”
The decline in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial hubs such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus break a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airfare prices also showed upward trends:
Because of rising kerosene prices, Economy class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, airfare prices in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for the Businessclass and the Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the change in prices is on the one hand the sluggish increase in the economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market demand is declining.
On the other hand there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit distance flights on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still does not come out to make the eleventh goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened, he could read clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled at the cockpit entrance of Hamburg's stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was for nearly three decades an HSV physiotherapist, enjoying a very high reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded and raised his fingers in assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg's head coach.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not accomplished.
“Today it wasn’t all nice to see,” said Marcell Jansen.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished to have him "more relaxed".
The 1:0 result (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his header impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty win,” Martin Jol said.
This Monday the Hamburg SV will turn 121 years old.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue sky over the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to play it,” said Marcell Jansen.
It predicts that the partial scores of the table correspond more to the velocity of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with their late-duty players like the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but the team still can't shine with their successes.
“We need more of the feeling and the dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the Voting Defeat
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank bailout package dropped a certain period the Down Jones to 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points for a day in its history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a bit.
At around 8:30 p.m. one of the world’s largest stock market barometers traded a 5 percent deficit of 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent to 1548 points.
At this time the biggest losers on the Dow Jones were American Express which lost nearly 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of nearly 12 percent.
No title could gain in value.
Goldmann Sachs shares fell nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had financially participated in the company.
The bailout plan provides resources to buy so-called "rotten" mortgage shares.
But the amount is going to be paid at a glance if not step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive stock option receipts for financial associations that during the course development may be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state cash.
Stock prices in Europe and the U.S. continue to fall
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate falls and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the financial market bailout projected by the state, the US Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite rescue actions by the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier’s share for a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and contributed a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
All over the world, financial markets have fallen.
The opening of Wall Street Day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear the U.S. government’s $700 billion bailout won’t be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the salvation bill, the Senate vote may be October 1st.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s leading Nikkei after-profit index fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75.
After the announcement of the capital increase Arcandor shares lost on the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the shares in the Thoms Cook company will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has puzzled researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity may not be as correct.
The Ulysses space probe spent nearly 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes confusion among the researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example from Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun probe Ulysses.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather they frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have greater or lesser speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during the gravitational assist to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity which describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers remained in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter that may also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known about the existence of dark matter for only ten years.
It supposedly possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible, which means that it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists’ calculations, dark matter makes up at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As confirmed by Italy’s foreign minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions for the ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the kidnappers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently freed.
On that same information presents the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news of the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are freed.
"We now monitor his health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and in safety, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
“The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the rescue,” the guard said.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly came "this surprise".
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and detained two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to take a position on this report.
Abuse of stepfather "leads to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Truro Royal Court, through an investigative study, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Ms. Rande had said about her, who after having been a great surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "renounced life."
In April 2007 her real father, Randle Terrace, found the dead woman in his Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession which concludes by saying, “I used to tie her up and blow her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen responded to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a gruesome experience, especially when he was only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, it’s that if she hadn’t, the issue probably wouldn’t have ended up in the courts.”
He added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An officer charged for data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June is going to be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is surely the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that refers to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the capability of security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the bailout/rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government, in fact, provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using the savers’ money, including the 59 construction companies.
The general director of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humiliating" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 trillion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley’s mortgages are redeemed.
Interest accruing in the meantime, however, is supposed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently ... are called upon to pay today the price of institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and the mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover <0xC2><0xA3>81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Trade Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there is no data to indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction societies and their members from what could be a relevant price,” Mr. Cole added.
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which can be almost twice as much.
Being mutual construction societies organizations and having no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
The citizens of Jersey will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence a liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following investigations by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply the price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest milk price had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh Denied Bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she may be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729.700) from a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several allegations of corruption.
Longtime political rival Khaleda Zia was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s military-backed government first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive some medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina claiming he could not obtain bail because he was already in treatment abroad on parole," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We are going to lodge an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her supporters argued that she needed bail to return home from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to his homeland after Oct. 17, according to a leader of the Awami League on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the interim government, backed by the military, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are charged with.
Fears for the polio campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been unable to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach the children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hampered thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision requiring the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Appeals for Competition that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests hamper competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of the ITV stake cast doubt on ITV's independence and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin’s chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB said the compulsion to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New Investigation into the Assumption of American Lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the inspector general of the Department of Justice criticized the action by administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Produtor General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to hamper justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The dispute began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from office by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it was later learned that lawyers had not rated themselves worse than others their colleagues, and many observers concluded that layoffs would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of election fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
They can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the dismissals, resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and underscores how he had a “primary responsibility” for the layoffs, who “abdicated” from his leadership position and was “remarkably non-collaborative” in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epic Meat Loaf of Much Honour
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony in London, said getting this recognition will be “an honor.”
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
Coldplay’s group are taking the nominations for this year’s awards and making the rankings for all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability as was used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf’s Bat Out Of Hell remained on the charts for about nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents, find it difficult to pinpoint the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little alley, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active lane.
There's no sign.
It is almost impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
who wants to repave Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-fashioned neighbors who commented on being delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block’s past before the appropriation of buildings.
However, the city’s Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the Venture Community Committee for Land Use meeting this month, representatives from the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the community’s district manager, said.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as a cafe, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month’s meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area,” he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was the city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is property development rather than management.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that appears on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The setting was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers writing about the bourgeoisie of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a slice of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk of the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow, dead end alley, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and windowsills, with weeks-old newspapers blown along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat healed through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and which now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty bottle of about 22-oz beer were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention at Extra Place, but suggested they could get it cleaned up.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet, and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “Afro-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English-students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in overturning the distance in the end results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and from low-income families:
More than a third of students, many of them newcomers, are learning English.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated on the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than the one favored by Mr. Obama.
The Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant evaluation of competencies and does not tolerate any excuse attitude.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, the school’s approach to teaching English to students is in “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like the latter who have come from Mexico and that if you enter the classroom 12 months later you would not be able to pick up what was."
"It works," he said, "we believe it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate by other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of his party’s politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates for bilingual education) and his same constant support for bilingual education obscures Mr. Obama’s prediction of the answer.
While it is that immigrants must learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "you must make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close loopholes, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil price drops sharply after renewed economic fears
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday over concerns that the U.S. bailout for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil shares fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 a barrel since Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before falling back, once again, because of enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, in the frantic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal “seem not to have been able to revive market sentiment.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates is going to be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the perspective of the products, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Analysts at the bank have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption drops because of the crisis in economic growth and the forecast of lower oil and gas prices is 20 percent for 2009.
Second Quarter Madness: Team Sets Record
After spending, for the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing on defense, Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen it all.
Then he saw things unfold in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a scoreless game into a deflating game.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazy under the gloomy clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between the players took a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of these when one cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," said Favre of all the steps that went to Coles.
“He’s a player’s devil.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think."
While Favre and Coles were at the dam, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to foul by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets regained the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a definitive 34-0.
They're the biggest points the Jets never made in a quarter.
The team's coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, said: "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked the second quarter much more than the third quarter.
They’ve earned a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Gebrselassie Rested Leads His World Record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown why many consider him the greatest runner in history, surpassing his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person able to race the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After a victory in the accommodating flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered by 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the race against the clock to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in hindsight - that air pollution would aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average a sharp 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
It is evident that the suspension left it fresh, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-Eastern rival - for the style of over-orchestrating his careers, generally avoiding meeting many world marathon stars, relying on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half of the race in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after their pacemakers slowed.
But just three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie took a final boost to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi came in third place in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also didn’t take part in the Beijing Games so it was described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and set her best staff record in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made a clever calculation run, letting a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners do it head-on and then recovering them after 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, the pride and proofs of life of color
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully black-inhabited city incorporated into the country and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not one jail."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, Harlem’s most famous Renaissance writer.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist destination by including it in the Florida Travel Guide produced by the Depression Season Federal Writers Project – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Ms. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who “knew so little about us and didn’t know what was missing.”
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
“We’re very cautious about the way our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a poverty level twice the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South - sometimes scorned, sometimes praised - that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And concern for the image of Eatonville really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her profound books in dialect such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through central Florida often forgotten in the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a cement face in both life and literature, Ms. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Outside the road on the left," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Ms. Hurston links Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor did not.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Ms. Hurston arrived in town, she did it without warning in a big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin continues.
But, she adds, swaying in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Ms. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremonies, no great public readings.
“I don’t think her contribution to the world or her legacy was understood,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography of Ms. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street of the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to his relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
“During that season, a group of white boys were going around town throwing oranges and everything at the people who were sitting next to them,” Mr. Franklin said.
“They also killed a girl once.
He was thrown at a watermelon in the car."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted rather than honored my race."
A Residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some ways, had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
“Black children were used to being hugged — I remember this — they used to hug the teacher in the morning and in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and CEO Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons — black writers, actors, and artists who went above and beyond prejudice, just as she did, with buoyant, confident, and lines like, “How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston’s anonymous grave and began to struggle to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her into the American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Ms. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposed highway.
“The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the city itself.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to the church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a resurfaced and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a street from the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit in advance is required to do most interviews, and some things — like the murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the countryside — cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that her island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way Mrs. Hurston saw her entire race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and equally the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
Here in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from kiosks and giant television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the honeycomb offices lying above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York face daily the worst “bad office day” since the low of 1929.
Boys for home delivery keep making their metal tea carts resonate through the sidewalks and carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to crawl between charged apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 eccentric-printed shirts hanging from a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning takeaway, and it remains impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on working days.
Employees are still waiting in line for their bagel to the carts of the vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed as if there was no crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time it took for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon at my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy’s department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “personal trusted banker,” and they were in line for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they had switched them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction company), from the credit unions and savings banks of their hometown whose branches only function within the state of belonging, and who claim to treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a bailout buyer.
The office and store workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank in what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her grieving-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, was commenting familiarly as if they were complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-something janitor in uniform from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my grocery shopping.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switching is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the left wing of the far-right party for freedom of Austria and Filip Dewinter Belgian, affiliated with the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs representing the mosques with a red line that crosses.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but investigators think this may have occurred because of an attempt to hide the real motives of hate-driven extremists against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were “deeply shocked” by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim religious as the month of Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that garnered nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and Austria’s Alliance for the Future, had led a campaign centered on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party leader who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas, and also voiced opposition to foods considered to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties try to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing policy of Islamization in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country’s strongest political bloc, indicate that the change came mainly from young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a travel ban last Thursday after magistrates produced evidence of Glitter’s previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Court Service said: “On Thursday, September 25 at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travel abroad as he did to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad, under being under the sex offender registry.
He has to inform the authorities in case he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the expected date seven days in advance of your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss Glitter’s individual case or possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “The Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “The Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the primary concern of the Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risk that may exist to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged 10 to 11.
When he was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually flew him to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow’s Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully enforced the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source at the Interior Ministry reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"Captured the master off-stage to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no ruffles, no premiere suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
Aside from the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments alien to the public, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a few hands, carefree because they are not going to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be anyone but, when looking at the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take photos of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco."
With the flavor of the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical base of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dance, singing or touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the elf that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veterans Sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter a moment in their life, be it a long or short moment.
In photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that sometimes you do not know, or that leave you only a few minutes to take the photo.
In spite of these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of current flamenco entitled "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 of Calle de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where it can be visited until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a recklessness"
It is set in places that he does not yet know and deals with unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is bent on carrying out the new project on which he works, a novel that has as protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite to the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday during his visit to the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that occupies him today "is a recklessness" and that "everything indicates that I should not write" the novel.
"If it were sensible, I would not do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days has seen pass through the city of the Aqueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the festival of the word and fulfilled the prophecies.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Felix Romeo, he found before him a dedicated audience to which he was made very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "live more than he lived"; how he writes of his "disciplined work" with his inspiration.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience", stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more unhappy", so he asked the writers "not to abandon themselves to frivolity" and "to assume their vocabulary".
The weather diminishes the Pozoblanco fair that also runs out of rejones
The festival of rejones that closed the subscription of the fair of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
Thus, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The inclement weather has been priming with this fair, since finally two of its three festivities have not been able to be celebrated.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second bullfight planned.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face an encierro of Castilblanco
On Friday, there was a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante sold his two asses with greetings and an ear, which granted more tended than his bullfight.
Of course, even worse was El Juli, who passed through the stuff of Los Llanos without sorrow or glory.
In his second bull, after a labor of relief he won the bronca of a large part of the public.
They skip a control in <0xC3><0x81>lava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The officers stop the two occupants of a van and they flee.
His cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not enough to stop.
The agents pursued and detained one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Traffic Unit of <0xC3><0x81>lava were carrying out a transport control on the N-1, as it passed through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated abruptly and skipped control.
Officers began their chase until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later on the shelf, at which point its two occupants rushed off to flee to the race through a wooded area.
The Ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with bales of hashish, so they proceeded to transfer it to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials checked that the license plate had been "doubled" since it did not coincide with the collection in the van's documentation, so the arrested has also been charged with a crime of forgery of public documents.
The Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as stated, and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28 years old, was transferred to police units to carry out the corresponding diligences and will be placed at judicial disposal in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Drug Effects
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California highway patrol told People magazine.
The witness has detailed that at about 16.30 hours, Locklear "was stepping on the throttle, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and backward, and when going backwards he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who had apparently not recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and exit the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because “I was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
“She seemed disoriented,” so agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and excess alcohol was ruled out from the very first moment, although "as officers observed at first sight, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effects of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison at about 7 p.m. but was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, assured today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councilman of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of doing favourable treatments to relatives.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its competences," said Llamazares about the action that the party will have to take with which until now councilman in the Seville council.
However, the leader of IU defended the need for "transparency" to be present in the possible investigations on the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "IU has always defended that these types of matters have the maximum degree of transparency."
In the same vein, he stressed that the formation has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'Blood of May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de mayo, the most ambitious film in his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Sangre de Mayo, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours duration.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled with this filming "a childhood dream", which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2 in Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million of budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set with the sets and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "a dull Spain that was mistaken as a boss for whom to fight, since, the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he has pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a funding like Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice that of Sangre de mayo -, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes captured in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career.
For this reason, the director of Restart, has emphasized what is his usual way of working, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting shooting and those who do not cast, because it seems "humiliating" and consider that "part of the director's job is to go to the theater and cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the performers with whom he coincides in Sangre de mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
A four-time Oscar nominee, Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, Sangre de Mayo itself, Seven tables of French billiards and the finally selected, Los girasoles ciegos, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be made known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer is going to pay tribute to a Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the neighborhood of Triana and when she was three she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I found it incredible.”
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" suggested a guajira, or "the snake dance" a tango.
Her dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic,” she says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one of his shows, as he did in the one of "La puerta abierta"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally has wanted to collaborate with whoever was his student.
"Matilda makes Tortola as a grown-up, the character of maturity.
I am happy that he has accepted to act in my work and I am very honored for that.”
The assembly also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were always divas in love, and who walks in all their extension".
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in places as far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have a huge influence in a given time and now nobody knows and much less values her work," Bayón says.
The show will begin today at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theater.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the object of the Nobel Prize.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of the Nobel and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel popo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, the International Congress is planned to travel to New York.
Likewise, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America Is Liked Less Without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on Absence of Malice, and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, to the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look how hard it was for them to get an Oscar.
It has been retired since 2007.
And I knew he was very sick.
Still, it was a hit for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better because of their existence.”
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the floor, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire are left to you, you do not have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was Richard Nixon’s formal enemy and advocate for lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his firstborn who died of an overdose to his brand of home-cooked, organic food.
A gift to a country that has struggled to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, noted that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“It has set the bar very high for all of us,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping high the demand for probity and a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their example.
He was divorced once but then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he surely had the chance not to be.
“But why am I going to eat a burger outside the house, if I have steak inside?” he used to joke.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
They called it the perfect race, and in my opinion it’s been the worst race by far I’ve ever been in.
A whole lot of nonsense that, of course, if you took it into account as an assessment and I looked at it, would be a very clear suspense.
But let’s go by parts and from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go earlier.
Which is not bad for me, but if they already make you go they give everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
So, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first nonsense, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second nonsense, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Or is it because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with less fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a minutiae compared to race day ones.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes lasted the wait, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, unsurprisingly, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once we got it, the pickup was worse.
In addition, the rain eased the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was joined by conatos of popular rebellion and assault on the cabin.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, will not even show up with the right time in qualifying, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not mark the start correctly.
Of course, if I was asked about the perfect race, it would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown a breakthrough of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the campus of the company) attending to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group the attendees according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be there soon.
All without a blue screen.
Awesome.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been much talked about a strategy change at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the necessities instead of loaded with commercial trash, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it'll be for less.
A whole finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is gratitude.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer boots only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the windows environment.
What is the use of half of the applications that come into the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft’s employee lounges in Redmond earlier this month.
In the soda machine a sign asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive in early 2009 but at the end, rather throwing in 2010.
At Microsoft they will surely be looking for the joint launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to pay off.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we start to enumerate stellar apparitions, we can go back to the image of that strong pointed moustache that lifted weights in a traveling circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men's indoor t-shirt in cotton, tight and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the Anglo-speakers call it, but le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all the others.
First, because of its booming name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with sport because it gets its name, according to legend, from boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag that the most emblematic t-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And attention, because the Belgian firm’s production is not only focused on its tank tops.
Also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Garments designed for underwear comfort.
Though it's a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Nowadays, the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango makes in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, wins on short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
On what is your new collection for Mango based in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we get many references.
Then, I really like getting lost in a city and watching the women how they are dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have many ties in common.
When I was a little girl, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to dig into my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know that dancers like to make our styles for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress when you get the locker room is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and professionalism.
You’ve been in your 30s for a while, have you had a crisis?
What's the matter?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I am going to be a mother because my body asks for it and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I’m not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movies, you’re looking forward to several premieres you shot last year.
That’s right, and I’m looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it can not be.
I’m looking forward to the release of ‘The Last Hour’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ’.
Let's see what they look like...
A few days ago you debuted on a runway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on a runway modeling.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I’ve known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization ‘Women for a Better World’ and the clothes we exhibited – I pulled two pieces from our collection for Mango – were auctioned off to raise money for this NGO from Naomi.
People don't know that tender heart of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that, I who know her, would tell you that many are not true.
Plus, I'm sticking with that very good part that she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he asks me to make the pine, then so do I.
For benefiting third world women, whatever it takes.
Alcohol-relapsed drivers must install the ‘alcolock’
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle drunk, or if it is not blown.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the State Attorney General’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so he will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor’s Office for Road Safety, the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving drunk take the car again.
The alcolock would avoid it since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abtes; or when an alcohol concentration is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be at the expense of the sanctioned.
A 2007 U.S. study showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infractions by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing those behaviors before they result in criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by the ordinary way, and, however, the necessary reform by the criminal way requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial modality, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some commercial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install in school buses this system, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17.40, the time scheduled in the program, landed in the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de Mexico DF the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias traveled.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced him to use his hand as a visor to watch the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you can not go to the airport to charge at that time... She is from here or so...
- No, no sir, she's Spanish but she lived here a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the hangar of the airport glued to the red carpet and to a military fence formed by 27 marines playing the salve of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, mane in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps they had told him that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a short stop to the photographers before moving to the room in which the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four big ones in the city, a reporter awaits them.
The best gifted award in fashion
There’s probably no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award than Paris and there’s probably no designer alive more exquisite and bont vivan than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango showcase at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried of emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino to preside over the jury of the contest, led us to end up at a luxury dinner at the Garnier opera house in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, heartbroken and heart-stricken, for the recent death of his brother, put on a suit of the House and some dressings of ELAH, which cut his breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a cannon of almost two meters in length - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his homage dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store with trousers and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner was transformed with a long black sexy dress, was excited when in the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the rehearsal room of ballet and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a charm of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for a walk around the palace, but first she showed us photos of her son on the mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to rejoice in the sight with the presence of Olivier Martinez - another cannon that moves by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And as if that were not enough, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine yourself wrapped in the hectic rhythm imposed by today’s life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and disconnection problems with the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Aside from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together on the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores by the hand of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, unplug your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up very smart telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while asleep.
The first time it happens, you may be scared, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder that is called sleep apnea.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (sleeping) or sleepwalking, but it does not have to be so.
As we have already mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitement.
It is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a calm tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him exit in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain inner calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once the sleep talks appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful Tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Although he is speaking, he is sleeping and therefore is resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes it would be advisable to consult or find out what is what generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not the most common), do not be tempted to question him to get information from him.
You will achieve nothing, because when you are asleep you are not conscious enough to organize your thinking.
Also you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so be very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
This creates children's anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on its field after a long period of shortage.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goals and was able to score a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann that touched the squadron with a shot from afar, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we would not let the midfielder pass and we would only leave Riahi in attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with Riahi and Temporale scoring twice for Dannemarie, and immediately following the opening of the scoreboard for the Illhousiens with Marais scoring, well placed to pick up the rejected ball in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the scorer Illhousiens will not be able to savor his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in inferiority numerical.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven Illhousiens who stepped back a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after an important fluff, the ball passed very close to the cross field.
Sarkozy finds fishermen furious
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a roundabout in Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by the fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and hoped that he would " come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " set up by Breton fishermen to take action against the rise in diesel prices, which set a record at 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the spokesman of the Elysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to return to be competitive and to save the conditions of jobs and remuneration of the sailors".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand firm.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to slow traffic in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
A " filtering barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination Monday by burning, at dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the oxen remained in the port, or Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday’s meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " they do not want to move to Paris " , announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter but believe that the financial equilibrium of a boat can be reached with only one diesel priced at less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>0.30 per liter.
The Great Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of " Two Men and a Fate " has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes saluted film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who has passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautical company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite threats of recession weighing on the global economy.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 deliveries forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado reaffirmed.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
American International Group, which has been helped out of trouble by U.S. monetary authorities, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its airline leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 percent stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, the Financial Times adds.
No definitive decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing U.S. authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it to the proper proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange experienced a historic drop last Monday after the House rejected the Paulson plan to save banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss on the stock market of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq lost 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, the day on which exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis early in the session, Wall Street sank after the House unexpected rejection of the plan to save banks that would have allowed some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"That's not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how far the market had this plan,” added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come “too late.”
“If the project is really moribund ... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the U.S. central bank, the N. of the Net) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further,” warned Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, " every day that passes announces the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, stressed Ms. Piegza.
Following Washington Mutual’s bankruptcy last Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions to the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, showing that markets are facing “not just a crisis in the US but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market rose dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell 3.632% from 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond fell 4.161 percent from 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama wins first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House followed another to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen said McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "brilliant enough" to allow him to curb his drop in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll of public opinion published last Saturday gives Obama five points of advantage (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama came out victorious with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them grant the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his candidacy member, Jose Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, underlining the "naivety" of his adversary on these issues that were at the heart of this first caress.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that... " he has accused on several occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without bewilderment, he was concise and accurate.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain hasn’t yet understood, while Obama has already done it,” a Democratic television ad this weekend reproached the Republican for failing to consider the importance of the crisis’ impact on Americans.
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a heavy rain.
The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is regarded by Americans as the most capable character to save the economy that is at the edge of the precipice.
“Next week could be a decisive episode,” said influential Democrat Sen. Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final consequence of eight years of poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that he would nonetheless cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street shocks, the Illinois senator also noted that achieving eventual energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a system of safety and health.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, both candidates sidestepped issues related to the extremely unpopular $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) bailout plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of polling stations in Minsk’s central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, he must resign".
Some acknowledge not having voted: “for what, since they will do what they want with my vote,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put a good face on foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to effect democratic change.
Sanctions, including banning visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and freezing certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are seen as clean for observers.
It was not according to the opposition.
"We have been put on the side of the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the vote count," said Yuri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroupment of twelve parties.
“It’s a cosmetic change,” said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, “because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it’s the executive branch.
If some opposition deputies enter parliament, it is because they will have been nominated but not elected.
"But his entry into parliament may mean television appearances, meetings in the regions, and bill proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has a lot of debts in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
It stresses that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) favored manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask the social democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition deputies in parliament, those who are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night returns again in the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec was celebrating its 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
Above all, it regained the public’s confidence that it had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public survey, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would not occur again.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, nearly 38 percent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
After having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained the public’s confidence,” he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 percent of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "confidence is extremely fragile."
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we institute measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond a doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleid acid tests that allow the direct detection in the blood of donors of the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until now were based.
Nucleid acid tests allowed shortening the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period by less than a week.
This substantially reduces the risk of certain donors being infected unknowingly and not being detected.
These improvements significantly lowered the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contained blood.
“That means you’ll have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that you can now receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health without worries," says the head of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We have to be constantly vigilant,” Dr. Décary says, before underlining that in addition to safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
" Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Since the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the blood donor network, which on average brings together only 3 per cent of eligible Quebecers for blood donation. "
All healthy 18-year-olds who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travelled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But members of this network of donors must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and incite them to be a regular donor.
Since current life is very rampant, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood,” says Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample and we expect to take more than a thousand of these out per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts early next year,” says Dr. Décary who describes this cord blood taking program as very popular.
“Many moms are disappointed that they can’t enjoy this,” as Héma-Québec doesn’t have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in every hospital in Quebec.
Softball - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the USL’s first-division knockout series, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in short ends) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the decisive second game of the quarterfinal series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half with no goal on either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals.
Roger Levesque was the only one who beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
During the first game of the round-robin series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the return game to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semifinals 5-4.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but series details will be confirmed today.
In Brief – Kovalev’s Victorious Goal
The number one trio of the Canadian is ready to embark on the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian to the free throw barrier against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warned the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play to the fullest in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation.”
Charest takes care of the North
The prime minister does not rule out starting elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party is over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected during today’s by-election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force by staying on the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his schedule was very busy.
The “Northern Plan” is the fourth side of a “vision” that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a “new economic space”, which includes a labor agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister limited himself, however, to explaining why the North was " a jewel to immense potential " , but gave no term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly the hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of the emerging countries and the reconstruction of the public infrastructures.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France," is our home, it's in Quebec.
It is not only our home, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he requested a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush at Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec territory, comprises a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the opportunity presents itself, I reiterate that position on the part of the government," he said.
In addition, “with climate changes, we have to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open every year due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Ungava Quebec party), have already begun consultations with about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role began some work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting at which " a common vision will be given " .
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan "will be concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s rise to power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Embalse Adelard-Godbout.
“De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the Revolution calm and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future,” declared Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the subject of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
“This stays among us, but I plan to be there,” he confided to his militants, arousing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He stresses that his schedule is nonetheless full, particularly because of a federation council mission to China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no difficulty in being accepted: the Quebec Liberal Party in particular called for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they would have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcomed the broad lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, resigned to apply it.
Had he done so, "we would have made progress today," said Ms. Marois alongside her candidate at Jean-Talon (vote taken today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec appeared to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," commented the leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of “Justice” (oh irony!) in the Harper Cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a “shame” for Canada.
To dishonor in this way this woman who fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says all about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are reproached to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and lets a child soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who clashes with a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can enjoy the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exactions.
We are not yet aware of that, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," that is the word that Harper keeps repeating and that makes no sense.
The time has come when there is no more morality: we can arbitrarily mistreat, torture, imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of the minority government so far wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, the embarrassment is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Discourse of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world’s largest gold company tried a six-million-euro defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to spark a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The result of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will muzzle the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it is before public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in a number of countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually about change of mind and not at clubbing.
It was enough for the miner to open her books, her files and establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent search teams that would have been able to clarify the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to distrust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can call for a "public" debate by scorning his views?
According to the Vice-President, it seems that this word designates only high-paying lawyers and not for all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the mining’s brutal manner.
This public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but on the basis of civilized changes of arguments, and not in the framework of what many people perceive as a chase-gag (persecuting the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a request regarding the authors of Noir Canada intiming them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold trial is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and make a debate about the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under pain of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he does not want to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street bailout operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms aimed at ensuring the reimbursement of public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for lack of payment, as well as a right of control over the wages paid to the managers of the companies rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Sen. Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We are making great progress towards a deal that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“It’s the bottom line: If we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos and disturbances on Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect of a new failure in the mood of investors.
The last time they had set themselves was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential election, who have acceded late to the negotiations, were rather favorable to the agreement, without however forgetting to express their discontent of being forced to reach this extremity.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the deal, particularly one that would allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the salaries of the executives of the surviving companies by the state.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, we should not congratulate ourselves.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, asked on another network whether he would vote for the proposed plan, responded that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable.”
The $700 billion plan aims to buy the dubious debts, risky assets and invendibles of American financial institutions with taxpayer money.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and causing a liquidity freeze and a slump of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe we have come out of stalemate since Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets of companies in distress are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In an effort to smooth out the rough patches for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to take on losses for five years under this program, it could impose new taxes that would aim to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of $250 billion to which another $100 billion can be added if the president sees fit.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote on the part of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will earn dividends in the event of profits and that it can re-sell when the storm is past.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the embargo procedures concerning homes obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on the remuneration and on the cash compensation paid to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure if your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against the bill yesterday, both Republicans and Democrats alike.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that "clearly, Washington doesn't want to understand."
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that consists of profiting from taxpayers.”
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is a small group cheerleader in Congress, presents the issues differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to hurry and to carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) during the risky real estate lending crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regained a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savers and families will appreciate now that the times are uncertain.”
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Did the American actor with a charming smile break free from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have removed him from the register of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at age 83 from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last American film icons of the fast-paced years.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he was much alike and who was long regarded as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and of the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make children magnificent.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate quality mark.
Because in it was projected a whole country in love with the self made man, the Pacific war fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 50s studied dramatic art at Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio of New York, before succeeding in the theater, in television and soon in the cinema.
This man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, dubbed by a sex symbol, although member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the secret sides of this secret star, discreet and committed, allergic to the scandals of the show world that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused a dizziness to moviegoers this weekend, as his big roles are intertwined on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of perpetually moving American art parades through it.
Many memories come back as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Zinc Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise’s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic mangante in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bittersweet billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar out of nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
The young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill’s Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 on The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a final godfather role for the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends who abandoned the career quite early, Newman remained much in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendors and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives in "underplaying" and that judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of a young gallant than of a marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed sides of his true not-so-well-known pudic sensibilities.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of shame and sadness.
Among the numerous tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very saddened: “my life and my country were better thanks to their existence.”
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen a lot of his face reign over the jars of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The proceeds from these sales were donated to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than content himself with his myth, will have been committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What were they producing at the invoice factory Zuschlag & amp; Co. ?
Very soon, on October 8, criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant harm, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized way in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor ' s Office, they used the funds obtained in public tenders for their own purposes, often justifying the fulfillment of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and those of the municipalities - in their entirety some 65 million HUF - stopped partly in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pockets of private individuals.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their obligations assumed.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were fake.
For this they obtained the heels in the market of the Józsefváros District and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that in the name of which company the counterfeit invoice should be made was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumptions and these served as a model to prepare the invoices that they presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit in that place at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, yet on the bill there were a hundred and thirty people.
But the fancy invoice manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft. gastronomic center, because in the bookstore of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s manager, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and shown the invoices, he already knew they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people can fit.
In addition, meals were also included in the invoice, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
Enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so on the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which also did not coincide with the practice of issuing invoices of the agency.
In addition - as it was known during the investigation - they included VAT in the document as well, despite the fact that trips outside the territory of the European Union were exempt from taxes.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, since the services of this company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the hotel employees only issued invoices made by machine but the invoice was manual.
Besides the "shippers" made other errors also, as in the case of a company in which they put in the invoice as activity carried out the transport by road to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not realize the company founded as consultant of investments.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehertó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, which is why the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
They consciously issued the invoices
Another group of manufacturers of fake invoices are those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the prosecution - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is currently in the process of liquidation, also collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices. In 2003, it provided invoices worth approximately HUF 5 million to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyy Economic Activities Association.
There was no movement of capital either, because later they cancelled the invoices prepared but forgot to mention in their documents this entity.
The next group of manufacturers of fake invoices includes those who have some connection with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trio SL with a fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the trade of fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices for an approximate value of HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since 14 September 2005 is under liquidation process.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also sent the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued on behalf of the company invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány charging the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies worked effectively because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generació.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
This man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri limited partnership to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont competition.
The Y-Generation and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért submitted a contest in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500,000 HUF from the contest, respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
In order for this not to be discovered, five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft were presented to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably relate in the trial - as they did in the Prosecution - the course of the counterfeiting of the invoices.
The most interesting could be the confession of the main defendant himself, János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this he has not done so far.
The question is: what interest does it have in doing so?, for perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists have come to an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can await sentencing in their own homes, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of overlaps: Why do we spend more money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University discovered the neurological—economic—basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people do not want to lose in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists attempted to establish the neurological scheme of this “game” through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was playing the lottery, the other was participating in an auction and in the meantime the active brain areas of the people participating in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system.
In both games participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the operation of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-premiering" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to the scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To support their theory, the economists of the scientific group also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive $15 more in prize money.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winning" group.
"These results cannot be inferred from any previously existing economic theory.
For until now, they explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University’s School of Economics.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
About 500 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 receive treatment because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses in dependence on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: Hepatitis A and E via food (for example with water or infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humors (sperm, vagina mood, saliva).
It is advisable for travelers to protect themselves by vaccine against viruses A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After this appear on the skin and on the whites of the eyes jaundice, excrement becomes clear, dark colored urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year one million people die worldwide of liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected receives drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can produce liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore, premature recognition, systematic medical monitoring, is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory monitoring as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease has cure if discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress the contagion and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
It aims to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less for those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent research, religious faith has a calming effect that also relieved the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed religious belief in how it influences human pain, the British newspaper The Telegraph reported.
As part of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while everyone was looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in a series of investigations in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University participate alongside academics.
The analysis occurred as follows; they attached a sparkling instrument to the patient's left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants in the experiment to fix their gaze on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci’s Lady of the Arminium of the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious encouragement among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo’s oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a reassuring effect.
The patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt “safe” as “protected” people, “they were reassured and peace reigned in their hearts.”
When they looked at the religious-themed painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, like by a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the investigation.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes our personality,” Wright said.
After these formidable results there remains only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his stature?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can say: he can be found both in people’s pockets, and in the sky above their heads; he knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what it is that interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwellian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to gather as much personal data about its users as possible, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of the founders of Google: “We gather in one system all the information in the world!”
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that stirred the world is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question what is going to happen in five years, Schmidt replied: I would like Google to be able to answer questions such as “What to do tomorrow?” or “What would be the job that best suits me?” – however, the software won’t be able to answer questions that seemingly simple until there is enough information from users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Internet the searched keywords, IP addresses and the pages where they passed at the end of the search are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-consult what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - on this same logic will be based the Recommendations, on which the system will offer products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who worry about seeing the information monopoly of Google.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only preserve, but in justifiable cases also cede to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify the pedophiles.
On the other hand, Internet users who care about people’s rights were relieved in May when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated before the court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the sentence, Google will not be able to be forced, through any of the points of the constitution to provide any type of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government managed to get under the pretext of enforcing the child protection law passed years ago, about 50,000 Web addresses and about 1,000 search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they think that it harms their privacy, their privacy by starting to use the services of Google, and rebel against it as against the multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not its rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the World, no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for its applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborating than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between people’s rights and the Internet that was produced by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about leaving intentional footprints behind and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them with other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then these can be included in a tracking system such as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries that are automatically stored on the F.
We can know numerous cases from which it follows that, for example, the bride, seeing the flow of photographs the next morning of common friends, learns who her fraudulent boyfriend spent the night before or they can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion in his blog about the management of the company: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person’s online life is what she shows herself – this is the definition behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least tries to dodge Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting with the Scroogle that uses Google’s search system, but leaves no trace).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but you can replace Google's "online" applications, from text writing software to image and news reading applications with alternative versions which do not connect with gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
The public is almost openly waiting for the day when Google will show its true face.
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), the advertising surfaces of AdWords / AdSense threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the numerous services that are introduced more and more quickly cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft but also to other companies.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example, the top management resolutely rejected the protest of the employees after doubling the price of the company's childcare, considered too expensive the unlimited number of employees feeding, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 the regime gave in to the moral interests of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement violated all the good information.
One of the company’s internal regulations says they won’t announce any new services in advance, but only when it’s ready to work, what if certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years may turn the world upside down: while some believe that Google’s project of scanning and archiving books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the U.S. health care Supreme Court, we can create our own system.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, will be able to provide a good raw material for the writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man only of the data of Google can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the fingerprints of the perpetrator of the double murder of the city of <0xC3><0x93>zd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd who, on reasonable suspicion, helped erase the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod province’s General Police Department said on Tuesday.
The young women acknowledged the crime they were charged with, and are currently accused of committing the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency they are two girls - will be able to defend themselves freely.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pre-trial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people premeditatedly and out of greed.
During the investigation it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in <0xC3><0x93>zd, where he killed him and then killed the victim’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared much earlier to perpetrate the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime scene.
The police analyze with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, even though the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are held by the Polish state, which in a few months wants to sell 60 percent of them.
The Czech economic daily E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that with it, in the future the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at around 5 to 10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
Major European newspapers in their Tuesday comments devoted to the deepening international financial crisis speak of a “second September 11”.
The global financial catastrophe is due to the U.S. president - opines The Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get his own party's support for the hastily made bill, whose objective is to give solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor” that billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it’s more correct to talk about a “second 9/11.”
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo’s view, it was the mistake of the political leadership of the United States that brought the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing more and more, and this will then have an impact on the whole world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – precisely when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
This threat cannot be ignored – notes the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw life belts at shaky financial institutions, saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if, like the dominoes, more bank collapses, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
It is necessary in the long run for the member states of the European Union to put aside their nationalist egoism and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that there are increasingly real concerns that, just as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not seriously dealt with the crisis that passes like a cunami across the Old Continent.
The “saviors” will not have to immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in which cases is it justified to use taxpayers’ funds to avoid a greater evil?
Smart Car Imitates Bumblebee Flight
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of obstacles sensors existing in nature?
For example, the bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic steering system of cars type BR23C imitator of nature, to which they gave the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our protective safety capsule – explained at the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, chief technology officer for PR and development and research.
The compound eyes of bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees play an important role.
To copy the function of compound eyes, the engineers used the laser length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at a 180-degree angle, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle’s microprocessor that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot mimicking the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any existing system today, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If this were not the case, the vehicle robot would not be able to react quickly enough to dodge obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which currently all types of collisions are considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be done in an open and close eyes.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotational movement and the acceleration in addition to the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the processing capacity of the data, much less the storage capacity.
This apparatus every second only needs to process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No gigabyte or megabyte memory is needed.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately dodge obstacles, which, according to Nissan’s calculations, can be incorporated into mass-produced models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, dodging obstacles existing in his way.
This dear child has a name.
A written version of the law has been prepared for the $700 billion financial rescue package that will be applied in several phases in order to buy bad credit from banks.
In the first phase half of the money will be spent.
According to East Coast schedule during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement around the $700 billion total financial rescue package, after several days of discussion.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the U.S. Congress, saying the agreement had only yet to be formalized in a document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking on the outcome of the compromise stated: this program will work and be efficient but more measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the cart of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, that is, on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 a.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock markets.
On the bill called the 2008 Economic Stabilization Emergency Act, the U.S. Congress will vote on Monday, first, and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also welcomed the news about the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all $700 billion to buy bad credit fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy credit fund securities, of poor rating and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the decision of the president.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new Congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: you can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and securities of credit fund, in addition to other credits of "poisonous" type as well.
The purchase can be made in auctions or directly - informed competent people of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson asserted: the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can reach up to 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it.
Instead, the heads of the banks that are in distress and await the help of the state will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensations, which the American slang simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of aid provided by the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed for gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failed boss retires.
By directly buying the bad credits the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the bosses’ compensations are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in U.S. history that a legal limitation on CEOs’ revenues will be in place, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional committee responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since ultimately they can even make profits from the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
According to the bill in the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return to taxpayers the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed reservations about the project.
This is not what the American citizens entrusted to us, that is, taxpayer dollars are not being protected,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said the measures urged him to do the same who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Domestic sales prices in the processing industry rose slightly, at 0.1 percent from July.
The largest increase in price magnitude occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), primarily due to a 4.6 percent monthly increase in bags and belts and a 2.5 percent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastics and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in chemicals production branch prices (1.6 percent).
There was a decrease in price in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 percent), in the production of electric machines and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 percent).

In the other sectors of the processing industry, there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water that represent an important weight within domestic trade, an increase of 0.3 percent was recorded in August, firstly as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from July 1.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period – in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors – the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector there was an increase of 13.2 percent, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of decisive weight, there was an increase of 11 percent.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile industry (2.5%), as well as in the manufacture of electric machines and instruments (0.3%).

Will you no longer need a visa to travel to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities for the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before Hungarians living there.
In his opinion, "almost everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time he warned that in the new system will disappear the entry premise, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin must register.
As of today, the head of the Hungarian diplomacy holds talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, handing her the Median Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ financial bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, assured Sunday their support for the administration’s $700 million bank aid program, while there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Finance Minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-style negotiations, announced early Sunday: an agreement of principles was reached on the financial rescue package of the banks.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to pull the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, as economic issues came to the fore, Obama regained a certain advantage and McCain’s advantage that he had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for vice president disappeared.
At a campaign rally in Detroit last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and responsibly ... your jobs, your savings and entire industries and the stability of the entire economy are endangered," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that “we will all swallow this hard... but doing nothing is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican senator said the proposal included the establishment of a commission of control to the minister of fineness and the limitation of the compensation of the executives, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any major role in the consultations, instead he consulted with the minister daily.
Congressional President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that lawmakers are likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious voters have become - says Der Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his supporters are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a black-red coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken office.
The Social-Christians for several decades were developing in Bavaria - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU gained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. even during the aforementioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have made a lot of mistakes in the pace. However, the secularization, the results of education and the settlement of North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had negative consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
With modernization, the possibilities are also increasing and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious, most critical and most stubborn voters have become.
It is surprising that in recent weeks precisely the conventional groups of citizens were the ones that drifted away the most from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those who have high school and the graduates.
Support for the CSU was thus reduced to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper in Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - it deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open in all directions to negotiate, but the Greens still do not want to consult on the coalition.
Elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties barely showed any of their decks.
Werner Faymann, the SP<0xC3><0x96> chairman, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question pending that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, in the post of vice-chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer cautiously reacted to the red offers.
He said the cooperation would surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tried to meddle in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
It is still open in the party whether they will elect the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must be discussed without a doubt, within the <0xC3><0x96>VP itself.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host is France which this year is also the President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, member of the European People’s Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that afflict Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press office of the group of Fidesz deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, the Roma are left out of the labor market in the first place because of their low level of education.
"The majority of Roma youth have not finished high school and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can obtain a university diploma."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, there is a need for wide awareness of these issues among both Roma and non-Roma.
For the sooner a gypsy student starts school, the more likely he or she is to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school desegregation, for this it is of fundamental importance the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens" - demanded Járóka.
The aim of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, organised annually since last year's meeting in Berlin to mark the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be made at the end of October on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the top of the Bavarian CSU, for the time being the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, chairman of the party, and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, remain in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided in the extraordinary congress of the party to be held the last weekend of October.
The members of the much criticized duo have hinted: they do not cling so much to their positions.
In doing so, they sought to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and their grassroots organization, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the overwhelming coup against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, of key importance for the Hungarian economy, conservatives still predominate, in the future they will certainly have to form a coalition with someone.
As a first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber’s potential successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that is starting negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Voters on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of Free Electors enters parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was exploited for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly erased the ambitious local politics from the stage.
The top leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber will also receive an active role that until now has been moving the ropes in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU called September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to enhance together the CSU that played a momentous role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could barely hide her disappointment at the failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday’s elections, there will be no opposition deputies in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability guaranteed in the country by Alexander Lukashenko, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
Although the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, made up of one hundred and ten deputies, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his term after the 2006 elections some deputies of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the "Constitution" this time would allow
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly dependent economically on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline that passes through the country - wished to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give a high-level political entry to Lukashenko and other anti-Tendem.
It was a sign of easing when the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, emphasized positive phenomena rather than mistakes - such as the ban on participation imposed on a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE’s primary report on Monday even criticized the campaign itself – in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press – and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has already considered the two regions as independent for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward and one step backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - he told our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime fears to allow even one opponent to enter that weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan to stage protest demonstrations on seeing the results, rather it tries to get the voters their message about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us a lot of problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in its distribution, but even so I see that more and more are supporting the change among the elderly too - said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that the regime of Lukashenko, who believes that its main result is the creation of social security, do not consider it appropriate even the most retired.
Due to the country's indebtedness and increased trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the breakdown of social security that "looks like the silence of cemeteries" - said Milinkevich.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in deeds", so that the lack of opposition is nothing more than a testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on she eats breakfast before she starts working"
It has never happened in the history of Palacio Chigi that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against who signs and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"Automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" the minister specifies.
“A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta stresses again.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, the secretary-general assures: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on the part of the workers".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and crescents.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister declared that "in three months the absences due to illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60,000 more people to work in a year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make public administration more effective.
In the last 8-10 years, wage dynamics have been double compared to the private sector and well above the inflation rate.
For now millions of public employees have joined in opposing the Brunetta decree rules by adhering to the Codacons-supported petition.
“While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the least absenteeism from work due to illness – writes the consumer association – the people of the ‘lazy workers’ is continuously increasing.
There are millions of effective and productive employees of the public administration in Italy who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate norms of the decree.
In particular, the exclusion of aggregate economic treatment due to sickness due to service, the extension of the time slots in which the medical check-ups of the sick employee are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions wanted by the minister will be answered in the Tar.
Work-related accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirms that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday in October.
"The worrying data released by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the president of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment of associations in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and awareness of public opinion".
“There has been a ‘enough’, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, but the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted at school for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work take particular significance.
It is a duty to keep the attention alive, not to slow down the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, underlined "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to put an urgent end to it".
"The data on accidents at work seem to point to a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
We do not want this “tendency to decline” to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level too little is still done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our judgment - stressed Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of the school ".
"It serves a further effort - he added - in so far as it concerns the communication and the awareness of public opinion.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship foreseen for the victims of work" and the "assistance derivation towards which the system is heading in recent years".
“The aim is to restore to the worker the guarantee of insurance – he added – so that the fate of the person who is injured does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time”.
MP3 Players Under Accusation, Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to music at high volume for a long period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injury.
The European Commission, in a statement released in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
“I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at an elevated acoustic level can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific evidence, a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and make this information public.
We must also re-examine the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this causes.
The scientists confirm that this is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music and related devices.
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as hearing damage may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing noise levels and exposure time.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices listen to loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the limit currently in force regarding the maximum noise allowed at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the schedule set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will deliberate the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the strategic Piano for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - tends to underline Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then be endorsed.
There is no over-positioning of roles, just the willingness to have a place to craft a great project for Rome.
In March finished the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporary end.
In June, we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.”
To whom the Commission accuses of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, your contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that come back and forth.
We, on the contrary, want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital expresses".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, of which we absolutely need, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome "will not be limited only to the current communal boundaries but will look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
A well-known American politician has written that he is interested in passing as an independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and had relations (as he also does today private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are escalating as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he won the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!”
In reality they are attacks that do not say much; they are attacks clearly of a racial nature and do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; all say that Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the voting booth we will well know who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mentality has been covered to the last.
“Say what you want, we’ll figure out where to put the cross, whether it’s on Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
Yet despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89% answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Likewise, Iraq for the majority has been Bush’s weak point.
Whoever assumes the post of George W will have a huge duty to perform.
In the United States, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Although, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are opening a breach on the Internet, for many seen as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope "that it will do something good" for journalism.
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of national executives are confident that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of "take it or leave it".
Directors almost always get good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For the holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, get "sick" followed throughout the year.
It’s all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the field of the investigation on the counter-pact related to the escalation Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the arrest process under his charge, last week, he obtained house release, transforming it into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate company to travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence accusing him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million plan of salvation launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
Yesterday’s New York Times confirmed that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, pro-federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to “those in Washington” and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, in fact, has become overbearing with the vow of him who spoke at the beginning.
This hardly cited is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake heralds: not only in the United States but throughout the West and not just here alone.
Both in the United States and in Europe, the crisis has long seemed to act as an accelerator for incubation phenomena that solidify and come to light with the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual category state-sovereignty in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking institutions – financial institutions that have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for the one who governs it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the question or they do not have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union which, as always, is divided between different interests and different state strategies, fails to decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: from the moment the cut is reached it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization will ever be able to dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do more and more with the little immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things which, behold, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So who finds himself as sovereign, certainly possesses many more letters regarding who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but foreshadows a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of inadequate economic relief species with many dark zones.
And together something deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in an increasing number.
It seems to advance more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions were the same as those of the social elites hitherto on the rise, the same way of feeling and of being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have made their own time and to be more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, manifested in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes in collective moods of recent times, from the Conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the right-wing rebels.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say any, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent what is now taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially agitates in excess.
In the face of all this, to speak of a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue for walking on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spider-Man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come quite close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered like a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by gecko paws, coated with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time “easily peels off the walls,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton School of Engineering.
“This material could be useful as a transient adhesive,” Liming Dai adds.
Layers to walk on walls exactly like Spider-Man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a far less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could have to do with aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also pursuing a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair that self-clean from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing as the case may be, the efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices being packaged that fresh associated with the intake of some medicinals David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, of orange and of apple.
Grapefruit juice was already under prosecution because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurologicals.
The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that resulted from this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink in case you are taking a drug such as Diasepam or Methadone.
Not only the apple – According to experts also orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milan: "These discoveries in general are pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not be impressed, ask clearly the doctor or the pharmacist ", stressed the expert of the Ansa agency.
The Novel of Economics by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy decisions.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attack, in those days when Enron was breaking, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggered much controversy and that for several years was reproached to the economy, but that has now proved accurate.
“I’m surprised and a little upset at how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly faded from public attention,” Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a “very aggressive, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office echoes the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by the volunteer developers, whose backs are watched by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and the less coarse magazine interface, more consistent ones are added, such as support for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also to the multifunctional with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it by email, or the possibility of importing the PDF file in the graphic development module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, over the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and was added to the English version that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usually the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of free can be a hook for dissemination in homes, it is in business that the Open Office suite tests, tries the big bet, being able to count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is not even a lack of realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, come in the case of the well-known Access is the program that allows to work in the data base; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth doping case
New positive case in the tour of France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best t-shirt of the climber.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive third-generation EPO racer, after Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Tests of Kohl's blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks in the laboratory in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the tests confirm that he is positive, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of the positive doping of Kohl to the third generation EPO is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he notified the Austrian authorities of the news.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, winning the t-shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES QUESTIONS, IS ITALY RACISTIC?
Italy, a country of emigrants, has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants "welcomed with hostility.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso murdered the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case underscores what the New York Times calls the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where there is “more integration and more work” but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support of the Northern League.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation wanted by the League tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend marked by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has asked the State and the Church to work together to combat racism."
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for college students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants’ union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to support - explains the head of the studies office of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has totally distorted the market to the point of triggering a process of widespread increase even for the residents".
Apart from that in most cases the rental offers contain a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, without limit of fee, sub rentals linked.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the revision of the taxation, prices can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for a single one.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they ask about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It saves only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you are served 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you are served 250/350 euro, at least 350 for an individual.
in smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and non-EU citizens is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: a 25/30% increase in the fee for foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic halls
Historical cinemas close favoring multiplexes.
“A city without movie theaters in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the big Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the big meticones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono halls in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
Disappearing are almost always historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared", observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the Oscar cousin and the grand prize of the jury at Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way of living always lost cinema.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of merchants, speak for themselves: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and most of them are paid for by the halls of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas less, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these three Italian regions are the ones that have registered the greatest number of new meticone cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, “it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its attendees are willing to transfer to the meticones.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is disgraceful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono sala both in the historic center and in the periphery.
Among the rules foreseen are tax facilitation measures in favour of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic area and will have special fees for parking.
“It is an initiative that I like”, observes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of meticones, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me was always important: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "Nuevo cine Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
Link between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniformize the elections of the Municipality for those interested to the Piromalli Cossa."
The charges are heavy that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the mayor and deputy mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association.
He was also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer of the same name for the boss, already convicted of mafia criminal association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any legal and moral norms, and good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
“The mafia family would have been allowed to officially enter the municipality, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between the bad organized life there are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean."
The arrests this morning add to those last July after police had announced the head-cutting of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, the local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I exploded a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call into question the vice minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even asked for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental intercepts made at Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniformizing the elections of the public administration over the interests of the mafia families".
When the energy is born from the waves, the great ones come down to the stage.
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s along with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was pushed aside, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give momentum to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated by 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” a spokesperson for a company associated with the U.S. oil colossus told the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to carry out new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, even if not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, because marine energy has no doubt a great environmental impact.
For now impacts like those of the Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas joined together.
The force of the waves, which makes the boa move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure rotates a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type in development, awaiting only federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and for a parking lot, using submarine turbines on the East River in New York.
The movement of water when there are tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long roster of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the power.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the Development of Electricity, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mainly about tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others approaching the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
