The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), within which the position of the current president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously faltering, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), Kärnten's sub-prefect Jörg Haider, is preparing the triumphant return in national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the vote, but loses 5.5% compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was for <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost with 25.6% almost 9% of the vote.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history and especially the literally catastrophic result of the popular, which led to early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the people had a considerable advantage over SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But the voters obviously punished them for sinking the government.
Even in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the chairman of the party, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe it could happen already on Monday during the extraordinary convening of the party’s leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties – the Liberals (FP<0xC3><0x96>) won 18% and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11% of the votes in advance – but the Social Democrats simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the popular to the collective government, (then the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still united from the BZ<0xC3><0x96> party, in 2005 it was separated from the EU).
Haider obviously plays on this evolution, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and presumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party was also able to enter Parliament, but it fell slightly, falling among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
No other party has evidently crossed the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may get colder
If the problem with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegal beetle harvesting in India were not resolved, there would be, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not resolved, then there would be some cooling," he noted after the meeting which took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that executive power can hardly meddle in legal affairs.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was acquitted by the prosecution and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the Minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher court.
Then you can ask for bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that, his partner expressed the same during the negotiations.
"It recommends the appeal to the High Court then it will be possible to obtain the pardon," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to lend the convicts "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations that have been handed down for many years with India.
Indians admit it, too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We truly consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake," he said.
The minister has avoided answering the question whether he has obtained from the Indian side a promise to take care of the matter.
"I've gotten relatively many promises," he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but in a small spot lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 workers from OSN Division for oceans and maritime rights issues.
His boss, the Czech Division’s chief lawyer, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and the enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find petroleum, metal ores and other mineral materials, but also living organisms unknown until now that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of medicine against cancer.
The largest seabed on the mainland
Coastal states have begun to lend interest to underwater territory.
According to the OSN convention, that is, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
According to the convention, it has an exclusive right over all the resources of the continental shelf.
In a nutshell, continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea, often beyond 200 nautical miles,” explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the Definition of the Size of the Continental Shelf must be accompanied by a very wide technical-scientific documentation based on many investigations and costly measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the commission with legal and technical-professional help.
The Commission has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees were successful,” adds Mikulka.
Australia’s recent success in greatly expanding its marine holdings has had a global resonance.
But New Zealand has also gained - the surface of the seabed, which was allocated to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers, so about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will bear in the future from the seabed, as promised, will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their demands.
They can do so for ten years since the "Montego Bay Convention" was ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity.
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Seabed is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, "by the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime established contractually."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If it shares it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 under the convention, as well as investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it is a near-submarine replica of Tatry.
“It is possible to extract on the total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” explains another Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
A worker of the Macedonian division Rober Sandev brings with him an artifact to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a little imagination, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
Special German units were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany for the release of the hostages – experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
More and more detailed information is coming to us about the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages taken.
German special units participated in the rescue operation, as mentioned by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
In addition to the army specialists, the GSG9 units, the Federal Aviation Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present on the spot.
As the ministry spokesperson said on Monday evening, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a forceful intervention, released the hostages as they fled.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
“We didn’t get there fortunately,” a spokesman for the interior ministry said.
The attackers kidnapped on September 19 in the south of Egypt a group of travelers: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end was kept secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the freedmen arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not elaborate on the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin for when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and special units are expected to depart in flight with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout package.
The first chamber of Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones is down.
With 206 entries to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there had been no majority for the program, which should have stemmed the chaos of financial markets.
In a dramatic move, supporters have desperately tried to persuade critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, incited MPs to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the suffrage was underway, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors’ concerns was that the state bailout could fail.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
The promoters record increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover of travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has increased significantly - for the winter season even by more than 30%.
Despite weak economic outlook, the desire to travel of the Germans according to an investigation remains firm.
On bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a turnover increase of 31% compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German association for tourism DRV announced Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK there are increased booking quotas even for the autumn months.
So the surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would amount to about 11%, the DRV reported.
Assuming these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyzes monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
Travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 would also be included.
Due to the weak dollar price, travel to the United States in particular would be required, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in reservations would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly sought-after destinations among Germans such as Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locations within Germany.
Especially all-inclusive trips have a high price tag, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculable for customers than for an individually arranged holiday".
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts for reservations made well in advance or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so that compared to the year before there would have been a surplus of turnover again - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip,compared to the previous year has fallen.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Hits of Ballermann, beer from one-litre mugs and vip in Dirndln branded.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually have not much in common.
She is blonde, television moderator and wears a custom made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing we have in common: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, the photographers are already throwing themselves at us and taking photos to fill the memory of the cameras – very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That's how you make friends
The two-dollar Dirndl seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist from Wiesn and an actual resident north of the equator of the white sausages, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress until today is still within the limits.
But once you arrive at the Theresienwiese, it’s nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only the apron of my Dirndl collects strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
One monk pointed out that I had tied my apron in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are busy, behind a widow."
I sneak up on my bow from behind to the left.
“Okay,” he says and laughs.
Others waste less of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which he heads "To drink to get dressed!" and stretch his naked butt against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a drag "ooooo"..
This tells me, after he got rid of his jar of beer from a liter drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a trash can.
Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbieslers".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 in the evening walk in pack on the square of the party the sanitary, who have to take care of the poor beoni
The nurses appear every time in the pack – always 4 at a time dragging a stretcher covered from tent to tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Who lies under the tarp in this coffin of alcohol in the blood,you do not see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", one of the sanitary staff yells at me and disappears into the slum.
Victim of an accident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died shortly thereafter.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on the charge of inattentive driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the finest relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the tour guides tell you.
The building stands straddled between the ends of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire building is slightly decaying.
But once inside the ticket office from the vaulted ceiling, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the westernmost passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retard in the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Its isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and dominating forces advanced out of Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly gone into disrepair, largely surpassed by history.
But nowadays, this rail route to Anatolia and all the points to the east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's ever-growing diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Its isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new commitment policy.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on the wagon for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy ride along the tracks that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state intending to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping malls and power bakeries, where managers in business suits - both men and women - meet to make early morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Dress, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
“The aim of the foreign policy party is now to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he says.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for one or the other.
They must be both.
"But surely at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "doesn't want where to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost everyone I spoke to here played out of memory: the ties of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those railway lines eastward through Asia and into the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another blank night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe's Middle Eastern ambitions can now be largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At that time, at least, there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent should make claims on this fascinating country.
Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Obituary, September 11) had in charge the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under 21/under 21, but by the time Proteus sang its final in 1979, many of us were over 20 – we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changing) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to face everything that music presented to do, whether madrigals or Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting, and it was all because of that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often we were told by Tod to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flourished.
Whatever the standard of music, it made him rise more and more.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a knight were to be appointed a conductor, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I’ve watched over 100 of his shows and I can honestly say that I’ve never disagreed with one of them – and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "rid around the world one or two well-known warhorses".
He will be missed by so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in sciences, a degree in letters and a PhD".
This follows from the Woodruff author's note in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the U.S. as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, we don’t know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his black and white photographs, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They drew my attention to the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda supersales
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz.
If the previous model was already endowed with great habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
A refined mechanics must be added to everything, which increases driving comfort and allows you to save fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before going on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after entering the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Nearly a million units of Jazz have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the heads of the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over the course of a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the drop in sales in Spain.
In fact, the company’s managers expect to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, 4,000 less than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a compact, five-door hybrid – 4.37 meters long – of which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets and according to the estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the Insight sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company’s presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the habitable interior is also enlarged.
This advantage derives on the one hand from the insertion of a new platform, and on the other from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution adopted also in the previous model Jazz.
In addition, the capacity of the boot – equipped with a double bottom – rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4-engined version, and that the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be offered in models with petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that lowers fuel consumption, produces less carbon dioxide emissions, optimizes mechanics and at the same time maintains high engine torque at all stages.
The 1.2-litre model offers a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions equal to about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which in the first generation model used 83 horsepower, there are now 100 available.
The Jazz 1.4 with 100 horsepower achieves a combination of 5.4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "bee car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking for example the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in vehicles of the manufacturer.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the bee's compound eyes, able to see in all directions with an angle greater than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, the engineers developed what they called a location laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism detects obstacles that are in front of the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum amplitude of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately, allows to prevent the collision.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the wheels at right angles or greater to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect up or down, nor even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can rotate and not exploiting endless directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require the storing of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, for this it can work without interruptions and with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to the destination avoiding obstacles present in the path.
Tremble before applying for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to possessing a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis and to prevent Americans from committing to junk mortgages in dubious insolvency banks, they have created a fun and educational game for users of the network: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credits"...or problems.
The gloomy appearance of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce to think not once, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not very detailed.
It’s more a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, there's a song room inside the hotel.
It is still something, because to buy a better house does not even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a stake of 21% in the Company, news received following a sharp decline in its shares in the stock market.
A week after the drafting of an interim agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The price established is 19% lower than the book value of the securities at 31 August.
MUFG will also invest US$6 billion in convertible securities at a conversion price of US$31.25, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on an average price of $29 per share, a percentage lower than its current price of 28%.
At around 5:00 p.m., Morgan Stanley fell 6.79% to $23.07.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to a bank holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to differentiate its shares by passing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than previously assumed.
The terms defined on Monday also show that in recent days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for an amount equal to $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: “We thought that our shareholding would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their book value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter are traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or at about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital contributed by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to clarify the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is therefore expected to set a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "clearly" lightened its budget since the end of August.
The past few weeks have put a strain on the group, which has seen the value of its shares halved while the cost of risk insurance has soared.
Cost that reflowed on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” among the big Wall Street investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
To found the republic on a socialism right in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to the official results, 64% of the voters voted "yes" to the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, the "no" vote was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, it would have to get half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polling stations and an estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa claimed victory over his draft constitution on Sunday and Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed gloriously," he said, congratulating Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The scrutiny, which was carried out calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points aimed at consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution enshrined the state's power over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants greater power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive terms of four years, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this amendment and to resubmit his candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the free health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando has launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive in the desert for ten days were brought back safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently fit, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base, near Cairo’s international airport, at around 3:30 p.m., aboard a special plane.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to give any interviews to the press, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They enjoy “good health” and no ransom was paid “to the kidnappers,” Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the runway.
Abducted on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been rammed from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the organizing agency of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night just before dawn.
“There were shootings, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled,” said the official, who asked to remain anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed, from Belgrade, the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We have to admit that if we have achieved this result it has been thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our intelligence services, of the special forces," he said, without adding further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle in which the kidnappers were found and to have killed six, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and to have captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers were linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a claim immediately denied by the latter.
The Silent Majority of Culture
On the front page a debate on the financing of culture on which the current election campaign focuses.
That's good.
But a part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will speak out to denounce the pitiful sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying 3.5 million euros for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that states that heritage protection is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by common accord.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the preservation of the historical, genealogical, archives and patrimonial assets, preserve, for four bucks, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states help by partial nationalization the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which ended up in difficulty first in Europe due to the crisis of the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level over the weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can constitute a precedent.
Under the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank’s share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first and foremost the assets, mainly insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week Fortis shares had started with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis of the institute had then presented themselves in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank’s shares fell nearly 12% on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current stock prices the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank’s executives this value is not real.
The company blames the collapse of Fortis shares on the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US plan of 700 billion dollars.
On Monday, the title slowly rose again.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the bank’s new CEO.
The financial institution has also looked for private buyers but so far no one has come forward with a deserving offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors should not be afraid of losing money.
There was no panic among the bank’s customers, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurers, based on people’s medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting the chicken coop to the fox,” writes the Washington Post, quoting Richard Dick, author of the program to follow drug prescriptions.
The insurance companies subordinate the insurance rate and the amount due in case of claims to the health of the possible customer and if they consider the risk too high they do not take out the insurance.
A long time ago the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was only concluded after the result of the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification code of the customer you can easily get information from pharmacies about what medicines he bought in the last year and a half and from this the program evidences what diseases he suffers and in what health condition he is.
For example, if you regularly purchase large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this means that your blood fat level is in practice incurably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
On the market there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplier, to the insurer therefore besides paper work does not remain much, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the cons is that some medicines are usable for several purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the point of view of insurance - commercial, applies as a factor of increased risk, the first two do not.
For the request and data processing, separate companies have been formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, request the approval of the patient.
The authorities now oblige them to do so even though they have not so far imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies have recently also processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to the data of medicine consumption in order to provide a more accurate picture of the state of health of the patients.
More and more companies have access to data and at the same time controlling usage will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives supervisory authority to companies specialized in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: that is why he has developed a program that links data forwarding with the express approval of the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the hens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Marseilles menu
EU and India to double trade
Since the European Union and India are mainly trading partners, the agenda of the ninth summit was dominated by this theme as well as all other global issues.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will deal first and foremost with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is becoming a major democratic power that should be given more voice in international affairs, but member countries have yet to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So this issue was not insisted on at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in his capacity as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, chairman of the commission, and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade in five years, i.e. up to 100 billion euros.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not a too ambitious goal.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also take off in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is India's first trading partner, New Delhi instead is only ninth among the EU partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides have played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in the energy and climate agenda, i.e. wants to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the need to conclude a global pact at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India will travel to the French capital today where in a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris it is hoped that to build the Indian nuclear reactors the French companies will receive an order worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our news agency the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
There will be over three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be institutionally present with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The meeting with the press at Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse will be followed: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and young people.
Steve Fossett's plane found, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a 3,000-metre high plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: “The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared.”
The sheriff said no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was reported dead in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Safety (NTSB) said a team of investigators had been dispatched hours after the wreck was spotted and identified the aircraft: the Bellanca 8kcab, which had been missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s personal belongings had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two Fossett-named documents, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, of cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search was halted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the round the world flight on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he had circled the world by plane and without stopping.
Among his many records, he also flew at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
An off-the-shelf SUV with an original design and well defined by sharp lines, wide surfaces and sharp corners.
This is, in summary, Glk the latest born among the offroad "compact" of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of fresh air in this sector.
Precisely for its contents outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Glk SUV, available at Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17, will also be unexpected and unconventional.
Thus, the hype that will accompany the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented mode of communication also through a futuristic 3D poster campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-displays, divided into three different phases, that will dominate the very central Milanese shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then recomposed in a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to stir the interest of future buyers? We will see.
This is who the Italian hooligans are.
Of the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian national team for years and that until now, in fact, had never created excessive problems.
He had never met any of his opponents.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added small groups (few units, in fact) from Campania and Apulia.
They have tricoloured flags showing the militants' hometowns: Saturday night they were removed to be unidentified.
They are inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a fan base of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The FIGC had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had a history of stadium offenses, had been refused the ticket and prevented from travelling.
Now the Viminale waits to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others are added.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way," they argued from Viminale.
So, "eyes wide open especially in view of the game of the National on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia, in fact, there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is, the secret services, which deals precisely with the problems of stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the outstretched arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks ago director of the Viminale Observatory (he took the place that was first Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been quaestor of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to praise the Duce but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Observatory - crimes must be attributed to the country in which the act takes place.
Until now this group had stayed in line, now we will see what has happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles at Mameli's anthem: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me, they are not an education...".
