What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elected officials in the capital’s city hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier in order to understand themselves at the municipal council level with their old and new colleagues from the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the concierge who was born in the last few years in the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition who were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it has been discovered that the new elected officials do not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say so.
This is Valdemort.
"I really don't know."
"I'm a young man in Praga's politics," said Lukas Kaucky, the culturally elected man who was tested for the vocabulary of the godfather.
And as for the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
“That’s the only expression you’re suggesting that I use.”
Otherwise, I don't use the crayon.
From the vocabulary of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-ectoral congress of the SDG, the editorial team has chosen 6 examples, mainly those related to the city hall of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", going to the pastry shop, "beef nerf", "betrayal of the capital" and "stupor".
Three of the elected officials agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
Fifth-elect Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test.
“I don’t care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy are having fun: I won’t give my opinion.”
"I'm currently working on how we're going to understand each other as part of our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the above legend, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
“This is the Blanka tunnel,” Kaucky said, adding immediately, “But I know it from the newspapers.”
“I’m going to have to pay for a language course,” he joked.
Not only matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen one for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"It's about, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of the Janousek companies.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no lexicon of argot in social democracy.
“I’ve taken advice from colleagues and it turns out that we really don’t have anything like that.”
"We say names sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, which party members call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Brezina said of the nicknames.
The daily Actual.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for Party members or the less friendly Old man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during party sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats allow to use within the party.
It is said that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor of Law" recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title of doctor of law JUDr. at the police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the older generation, cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and do not have children.
The one who becomes a "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
“Man seldom has this destiny.”
“Young women are not judged healthy because they participate in labor and give birth to children,” says a sister who works in the West African country’s capital, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He has published a brochure that should help limit witch hunting.
The case has a "hic".
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” warned the daily Die Standard about the inconvenience of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had sprinkled on her.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
The criminals say it was the evil eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual anointings became inflamed in contact with the woman.
The oil blazed, it seems, when the team wanted to "chase out the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Human spirit eaters have always been a danger,” he says.
While Burkina Faso is striving to reduce witch hunting, the Gambia did not later than last year even see the President himself participate in it.
"President Dzammi of the Gambia, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch-hunt which, it appears, participated in his death and endeavored by black magic to kill the President as well."
"Shamans from nearby Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal guard of the President, randomly chosen men and women from villages in the Gambia," Amnesty International said in a message.
On the farm, the imprisoned had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that also had other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
Under international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The stalls are heating up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man walked out the door of the RPG Byty company's customer center from the "coal bar" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying under his arm a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and that of his son who is serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 second category apartment 4100 kroner.
“And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel,” he points to his son’s new contract, the man who has the signature power.
"But I signed anyway," he said, half angry and half resigned.
The citizen association of the BytyOKD.cz apartments, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to follow to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a hand gesture.
"One says this, the other says something else" frowning.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" as your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the topit of the waiting room.
In a split second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere else - requests for repairs, insurance events and so on.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mail with new leases in their mailboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special window for new rents has been open to the public since November 18.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still on trial," replies, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and the former miners’ apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and native of the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported this in a fairly sustained way before the elections and this now fills the local newspapers.
“Twenty years after them, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change me a fucking board in the toilets," the man said in the introduction.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as promised RPG in a special offer.
This is a discount of half the amount of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska street is really not overwhelmed by questions.
“Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent,” the employee said at the counter.
And yet RPG offers both on its website and in the showcases individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, it is an independent court that will make the decision.
“It’s not about threats but just informing about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” RPG said on its website.
“Nobody will go to court here,” thinks one of the RPG Byty employees, and the man in the street in front of the customer center gives him the reason.
“I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and so people wait," she says.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the fund for housing," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the fund for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 that should make 5.2 billion.
The large screen hung from the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
“The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments.”
"And it will always be no more than 7.50 CZK per m2 per month," the screen reads.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2", adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rent increase (cf. the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the rent increase have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices have included the architects.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of the employees of Arch. design can go there.
The architectural project company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has been imagining its mini business nursery school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
She employed about 90 people, mostly from childbearing age, and cared that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
At the same time as reduced-time employment contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work that takes care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who conceived this kindergarten and with the support of management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The Mini Nursery School is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
They were able to purchase equipment and appliances and after two years ensure a qualified staff as well as the start-up.
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project took a year and it was the company Economy rating that helped to apply for staffing.
The children are cared for by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children all day long. children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are more than three years old for the most part.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace each other.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the mini kindergarten program is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children do not only play, but quality education is also ensured - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches, English is taught.
The classroom is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of being late to pick up the children at a school away from the parent's workplace.
Parents use their time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly towards the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric Saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its organic forms, the house has received from the locals the nickname of Bone House.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaic, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, that is all that is epic for the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudí.
The front facade of the house unfolds its dream lines, colors and pleasant textures that recall nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelet and the slats.
The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born from the construction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-dwelling house was not conceived by Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
For the facade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the Casa Battlo plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Mila and Guell Park in which there are other works by Gaudí.
The locals nicknamed the hot house just after it was finished because of its organic shapes "the Bone House".
Others, considering the specific mechanism of opening the windows, called it "the house that leans".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its time of central heating, with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree tilt seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi did not respect at all the building guidelines of then and did not allow himself to be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the permit to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finishing the municipal council was horrified and asked for changes.
For example, the members of the city council did not like that the pillars of the construction encroached on the public sidewalk.
There was never any modification, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third one bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the lounges and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudí has also received new facades a non-traditional roof and two more floors.
Gaudí’s play with light is also impressive, with blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with the wells of lights.
The two-color play gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark, which on the contrary absorbs the sun’s rays.
The Casa Battlo house that was listed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the visits as they found it to be a lucrative venture and they expanded the scope of visits to the common areas and attic including rooftop terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist cardholders get 20 percent off.
The sum is still above the price of entry to Gaudí's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and bedspread: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the area reserved for bed, so the mattress and the bedspread give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the choice several things are determining,:weight, height, age, health status as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which we will place the mattress and the backrest is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not continuously slept, they are not suitable because they "warm up" gently.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
Habit is also decisive in the choice.
The one who spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses with a softening layer are frequently used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
“That’s how all the hockey players who come back from the NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
“For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam.”
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system who therefore misunderstand the 'information' of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything is going well, for example, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses.
You don't have to be an NHL guy to be able to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t turn around in the night like after a tough match.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works as a protection against sprains.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in all.
For single beds, singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It is convenient in case of a visit.
'However there is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should lay your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly bent.Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Borreliers-mattresses and decorators who for several years is dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of the specialized furniture and teaches it in the schools.
For a two-seater bed everyone needs their own bedspread and mattress, so be careful however during the purchase to choose the height of the mattress well.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the bedspread at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, mattresses with springs at least 15 cm, of this count for the layer of shape and ventilation at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of bedspread.
The bedspread, when the mattress and bedspread are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses looked very bad; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night one normally sweats from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this reason, the specialists refuse to make a claim over a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But all his own.
And for this a tip of experience from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, forgo, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make zipped coatings for the whole, that is to say that after opening one has two parts (for the washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for the large models (and for only one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a bedspread?
Never, ever!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However equip the board (if there are no) with aeration holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bag springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single-position laminate bedspreads with 14/18 lamellae, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more lamellae, 28 and above, where the lamellae are lined as well as rigid in the lower part of the kidneys possible
For multi-position mattresses it is not necessary to take a spring mattress because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the strips, it is also possible to install what is called a shoulder cradle.
It is a special connection of the lamellae that allows to press or even to tilt the lamellae so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have “shoulders as wide as the back,” this is really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by the manufacturers of mattresses that for the "males" have started to use a softening area at the level of the shoulders.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or wafer beds with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and depletes the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and bedspread, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow should support the head and its tips should reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians for example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (with the cradle of the shoulder of the bed mattress or the area softened in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also for organic mattresses.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use just soybeans.
“The organic label for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products,” explains Petr Vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress linings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender scents.
There are differences between man and woman.
While birch plant extract so that the mattress lining absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the linings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
Current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know precisely where the head, lower back and feet are located.
You will pay for a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those that are characterized by their parameters for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached the first place.
Saving for the mattress and bedspread is not easy.
From time to time two mattresses can be obtained in special actions by manufacturers or producers for the price of one.
For example, the company Magniflex offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and great thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" pace.
This started as matter for NASA because astronauts were subjected to enormous load factors at start-up.
Tempur softens in the heat and hardens in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is therefore ideal against bad sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and venous system.
Czech manufacturers use for example EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly being demanded by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases such as that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox but will soon be about the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware of it, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to carry something of this type on him, he will get rid of it.
“Even the youngest can show great creativity when it comes to intentionally getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already led parents to long expectations,” Bockova said.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is highly questionable.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
“Right now it’s the phone.”
"As soon as the tracking devices are developed, they (the criminals) will also pick them up because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help during an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The device can be set in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
"The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and ends up in the lying position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with special software.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn as a matchbox-sized pendant or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracking cars.
It is a combination of GPS position acquisition systems (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a cell phone function that alerts a vehicle's current position.
The army has so many detonating strings that it could go around the Czech Republic with. But it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defense had purchased 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the strings is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating ropes from the STV Group for 40 million kroner.
The general staff gave as reason for the purchase of a huge amount of detonating ropes at MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosives exercise every year.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating ropes.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army reserves could sustain it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it is true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough at most 2 m of detonating ropes, as the experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has secured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
There is no mention of the lack of body linen.
“And I don’t mind if they buy from us such a large amount of detonating ropes.”
"And it's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"For us the military is a good customer that we strive to satisfy as traders," says STV Group Sales Director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, argued the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of detonating ropes by the fact that the army will have these "ammunitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports only four years of life of the detonating ropes and only two years of life of the police and army pyrotechnicians.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can go up to four years," says one who does not want his name published given the criticism of the army.
The life span passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests, however, are not free and still cost money.
The department's other argument is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating ropes.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek, who interpreted the opinion of the defense ministry's buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This was established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and to be able to more flexibly obtain more modern and reliable types of detonating ropes.
The Ministry of Defence is currently having serious problems with the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading for the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating ropes that it buys today "cheap".
To this day I take advantage of contacts that I have obtained through the contests.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun well for the place of winner of the competition of the best Individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of last year’s competition for the best individual entrepreneur was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was a lack of a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a third-year graduate student, it was a courageous action.
“The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building which he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial activity has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until very recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, another one of the same quality happened to him.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise showed up," the number 1 entrepreneur of last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition served well," adds Pytloun with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in and around Liberec.
“People recognized me on the streets, congratulated me often and, I have to say, it was very pleasant,” he recalls.
He recommends participation in this competition to anyone who is trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and acquaintances to this day that he could not have obtained otherwise.
"With those I met through the competition I started to have regular business relationships.
According to him, the fame related to the success has also had an impact on the employees.
And he's about 70.
“I observe in them above all the loyalty and pride of having engaged in something that has been generally recognized.”
"This is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of good work from all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of purpose the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind it.
The one who came to pick up the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the contest for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury has rewarded the efforts with which it has transformed a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
"I can say that the award has encouraged not only me but also my collaborators and has increased our self-confidence to fight the competition," said the winner of last year's competition.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company has been known even among the non-specialized public after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
“Not only have our customers begun to really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also foreign partners who have begun to realize that they are collaborating with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year did not happen at Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's valuation was based on the economic results of 2008 and partly of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, societies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new materials and technologies.
“We obviously did not escape this situation.”
"The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society needs to know that unpopular measures need to be taken from time to time.
But they managed the situation properly and retained beneficial results even though they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued to invest uncompromisingly in research and development.
"We built with the endowments a training and research center, strengthened the company's presentation in international trade shows and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers are rising and so is the number of employees.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes foolish regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year survey is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
This year's unsuccessful winner of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social administrations requested a paper extract from the commercial register, while the official can obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the trade register for insurance payment checks," said Jana Buranova, a spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To bring out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must complete in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the Absurdity of the Year.
This investigation is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters came out, at least 4,000 this year brought their voices.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the business, and,this, more and more.
"We may be among the first places in the world to file tax returns," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship has become a goal proclaimed by all governments in recent years.
Compared to the rest of the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place in terms of conditions for the company, 8 places more than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first established in 2006 and continues each year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report the administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the end of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that received the most votes is declared the winner.
Until the last survey last year, there were a hundred, or more exactly 105, regulations and decrees that lost their meaning of existence.
The comments are sent by the entrepreneurs but also by professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees is, for example, the obligation for highway and highway maintenance vehicles to pay tolls, or for contractors with twenty employees to repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always begins at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the climax of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts asses in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to suppress absurd decrees is not a blow to the sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days in advance to the office for the individual company at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Individual Business Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007 was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, which was abolished with the Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year’s Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the year 2010.
The objective of this competition is reasonable and fair business support.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impacts of their business on the environment and conduct socially responsible activity," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the competition of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, have registered companies that do not have success with a single long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is full of inspiration and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the purpose of their business is different from one another, their support and forecasting activity can be seen as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this relates to persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic is the Prague software company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund sponsoring children with disabilities for 17 years.
The old paper mill in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of its employees, has been awarded the title of Responsible for the Central Bohemian Region and ranked third in the region in the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has won for introducing flexible working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, this, without, proportionally, wage decrease.
The jury also unveiled her title because she buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports a dittoian activity in the surroundings and cares about the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,” said Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
The company responsible for IT Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation that helps the local Roma community," says Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
In the last rank is, also for its activities, a Washing and cleaning company of the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our company we contribute to food, transportation, increasing skills and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company bruntal Czasch, winner for the region of Moravia-Silesia.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category, who had answered the questionnaires attached to the document for registration and had sent it back to the organizer by 15 August.
Incomplete or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organizer.
If the representatives of the contesting firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm Responsible but were not disqualified from the contest "main" Vodaphone firm of the year.
"Independent registration is not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Firm of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Pilsen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed the local contractor and real estate trader Lubos. G.
The latter had endeavoured to precisely manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a request for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a particular candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in the context of a public call for tenders and a competition," the head of the prosecutor's office in Plzen, Antonie Zelena, told the Pravo newspaper, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations as the investigation is ongoing.
Police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
To find out how he could influence a public competition, one can only speculate on the basis of so little official information.
Speaking to Pravo, Lubomira Cerna Land Fund spokeswoman said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a customer and in no case an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Law on the land" and is set up when several candidates manifest themselves as beneficiaries of law.
"These individuals propose, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their redemption rights that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a classification of the buyers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the Fund's spokesman said.
Lubos G. had, of course, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the appeal and, as he himself was also a beneficiary because he had purchased a large number of rights to restitution, he had proposed to the candidates for the field not to participate in the competition.
And he probably paid for it by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the standards at the FdT (Lodge Fund).
He was included in the case of former FdT chief Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for editing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been edited.
For example, Lubos G. had obtained land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the access artery to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was obliged to accept because otherwise it risked jeopardizing the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional one hundred crowns monthly for housing.
Households will have to pay a surcharge from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will therefore have to draw up to a hundred crowns a month from their wallet from January onwards.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for the water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to bring apartment households around 100 crowns a year more than currently.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the significant development in encouraging the production of renewable energies, in particular photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the highest consumption.
One can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the larger municipalities that plan the price increase.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns more per month, Liberec families will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing a 9 percent increase for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the Pragueers will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are up 7.4 percent.
For example, rent prices will increase significantly in the 450 thousand apartments rented from January, that is, at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns nearly 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, decided on an increase of up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by the company.
The regulated rents people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk on rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very slowly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from the parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of children's departments of hospitals.
“Beer or wine is no longer fashionable because it takes time to get drunk.”
"The trend is really to strong alcohols," said Pravo Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department at the Horovice hospital in central Bohemia.
“When they manage to chip a dad bottle in the closet, it’s sometimes whisky but it’s the fernet and the vodka that prevail.”
“Vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not smell it,” explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman for the Motol hospital, is also right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"It's now alcohol in fashion especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the head of the Pélikan department, seeing drunk children aged thirteen to fourteen on hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced ten years precisely in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide surroundings completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized like this four times
“She began her career at the age of 12 when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood and a mixture of ecstasy,” the doctor said.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
“What’s interesting is that it didn’t seem odd to the mother that her daughter was away for 48 hours,” the department director said.
It is precisely the disinterest of the parents or their extraordinary tolerance of the fact that their offspring indulge in drinking that are the main cause of the development of alcoholism in children.
According to specialists, however, we are not talking about addiction, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the word alcoholic we mean a chronic dependence on alcohol of several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that we do not find in children."
"In those who use alcohol on a regular basis, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," explained Department Head Pélikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistic.
Drunk children who are after emergency care taken home by parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, it exists according to Pélikan three seasonal waves with which we can count: the day of the witches, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink out of spite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the start of the holidays."
"Of course, I experienced the admission of seven drunken children at one time on Witches' Day," Pelikan said.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the next day from the "hangover".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they have an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
“They’re just amazed at where they are,” Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils patients’ good mood at least with the bill for their care.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on an intensive care bed can be up to tens of thousands of crowns.
“From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend the whole summer on seasonal work to pay for a single evening,” Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regressive managements, which are expected to recover care-related expenses from parents, do not deal with cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two of the five L-159s, for which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in the course of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were until now in service in the Czech Army and that were in flight condition.
The three remaining aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defense, the physical departure of Vodochody's planes is currently unknown.
“The L-159 single-seater aircraft planned for the exchange were taken on long-stored aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defense.”
"The two-seater L-159 T1s have been exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seaters since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-seaters into two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS has committed to introduce the aircraft in the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159 aircraft are EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore up to the person who considers how to do this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for tenders and contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued that the exchange ensures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen as part of a European-wide call for tenders and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
An index longer than the annular is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the index finger longer than the ring finger are at a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This can depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that relative finger length serves as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men before the age of 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining it with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of their right hand shorter than the ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index finger longer than the ring finger, however, the risk fell to 33 percent, for men before age 60, the risk decreased to 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that helps the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK he was aware of the study but did not believe the relationship between finger length and cancer was "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow this Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, clearers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 highway in Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the news
At the 91 km a truck was accidented, at the 93rd two heavy trucks were hit, the accident injured.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
Drivers should exit just after Brno at 190km or go through Brno and then enter at 182km in Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers was formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just upon arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Lines of cars are created for example in Prosek, Sterboholska street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The trams are delayed for example on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the crisis staff in Prague has yet to meet.
The railways and the airport are also experiencing problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 rapid connections because of the snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should be in control of the current situation.
The airport of Ruzyne was closed since Wednesday 11:00 in the night until 5 in the morning.
Most roads in South Moravia are already rolling but with redoubled vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there is starting to be snow gusts in places and on the road to Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass some communication lanes in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected areas.
So far the routes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snow removers and snow cutters.
At the moment, we cannot estimate when they will be rolling.
On the road to Hodonin caution is a must in the region of the White Carpathians.
On roads that are, in view of the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In Czechia, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall is gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new ‘smart weapon’
The U.S. military has sent a new “smart” weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and “will change the game” for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super-precise cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few meters.
The special ammunition of 25 mm calibre developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, actually works like small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when a deadly rain of steel splinters falls on it, it can put it out of combat as well.
According to Richard Audette, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses “smart” technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends it a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise aiming point, according to which he corrects his site aim and presses the trigger.
"Let's say you targeted 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and fires at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 jobs relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year, in July, 400 employees will move their workplace, which is currently located in the office building at Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region, to Astro Park.
Japan’s Fujitsu Group is relocating its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer-manufacturing and maintenance giant said on Wednesday, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, so far located on Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman said that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together 100 more jobs scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and Astro Park's open-plan offices are better suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
CEO Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with an outstanding infrastructure."
He argues that the connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday aroused the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The head of economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
Management informed the municipality very early of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer against the owner of the building in Marienbader Square.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a question of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will cooperate."
Ten years ago, the building on City Hall Square, used until now by Fujitsu and the neighboring "small vertical", as well as the rest of the buildings on Marienbad Square, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
The result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hall, which aroused many criticisms, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas that once served partly as parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment consulting firm Feri, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer then still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German specialised Frankfurt group Immobilien-Chancen acquired the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, is the world’s third-largest provider of IT products.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to move to Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with increasing force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, eminent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely staying in Britain, according to reports published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said Wednesday (local time) cyber-activists responsible for the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber-enterprise, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the release of the secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the largest number of documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: “Formidable, our dollars are now being spent on caring for people in Europe.”
When free speech is a problem for Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Liebermann’s office, reported that Amazon banned WikiLeaks from using its servers after the investigation by collaborators of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper The Guardian reported.
"I wish Amazon would have taken this action sooner, given WikiLeaks' previous releases of classified information," he said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
“Wikileaks is acting illegally, monstrously and unscrupulously, putting our national security at risk and our lives around the world,” the independent senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks disseminate the contents of the stolen documents.”
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to reports by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently called intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions launched against him by Sweden.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been made against the site.
“Calls have even been issued for the murder of Julian Assange.”
That is why Assange is particularly concerned for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Governor Mike Huckabee has demanded that the person responsible for WikiLeaks’ revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s adviser told television, obviously ironically, that Assange should be “killed” and that Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, a controversy has erupted between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the recently leaked order given to diplomats to engage in espionage activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website,” Gibbs says.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government is now completely putting the protection of its databases on the test bench.
According to a White House statement, Mr Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism, has been appointed responsible for fighting leaks.
Mr Travers is tasked with implementing "the necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after Wikileaks' disclosure of diplomatic cables.
The White House also has a willingness to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by Wikileaks revelations.
“We have done everything we can to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if necessary.”
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, we prepare ice cream confectioners for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was a huge success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where did all the ice come from?
The Glacier and the Ice Machine.
The glacier, that is to say in German the confectioner of ice cream somewhat outdated, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated display case using a spatula, places it in the waffle, and then starts selling it.
To find out, one does not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The ice cream maker founded the ice university in 2003 so that the ice creams coming out of its machines everywhere meet the high Italian ideals.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was a huge success and attracted visitors from all over the world.
There are also special courses on chocolate ice cream for several days, as well as hands-on sessions at the private ice cream parlour.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their ardent desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia and Hungary.
Jacky, a teacher of art education from California, is a fan of the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the country of Industrial Ice in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and, after a few years, she wants to get something unique out of this nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian maid came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency are crucial.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, the south: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a great dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a faucet installed on the machine: it comes out a white pasteurized base cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately beset with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
Anyone who only talks about ice cream "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers despite this: most often a natural product, for example, guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will not crochet anything but ice pellets.
Some changes to the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the fruit or confectionery department of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in the recipes for fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when cocoa powder is added, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
Different kinds of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is absolutely not better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The very popular kiwi ice cream is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture correctly enhances the taste of an ice cream,” Luciano says.
Ice making is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (winners use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as in the past.
It is not only the automatic base mass making machine that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the ice mixture available is simultaneously beaten to make it creamy and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo swallows fruit puree from head to toe and, thus, splashes his fellow students when the control of the colossal mixer bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano believes that "a similar incident may occur in each class: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has nucleated the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now made by the expert group Testbiotech which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve been well informed,” said Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
Some reports indicate that the chairman of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of EFSA's testing requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to Mr. Then's criticism.
The requirements drawn up correspond textually, by subparagraphs, to the position taken by the Ilsi lobby group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities based in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period.
Recently, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the EU control authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions from both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, EFSA does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
There is an opinion that all reliable data, including industry data, is used as long as it is of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from establishing contacts with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the US-based International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi).
This body considers itself a neutral forum for experts from, inter alia, science, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being on the payroll of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding tests in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the impacts of genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
"If we don't look for the risks, how can we find them?" Then asks in an accusing tone.
This is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are barely any researchers who are not linked to societies.
In the opinion of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "industry controls safety research".
The Trace of Stone
Uli Gsell got it, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday afternoon, she was standing in front of the Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a manif.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, excavators had come and started to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of the Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billions.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the protests led to the halting of construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He obtained a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly."
He claimed that by cutting it to the saw, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He does not yet know what he will do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to an old ammunition depot of the French army in a forest located near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a disgrace if they were crushed or if they disappeared in the dump," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was the subject of insults and threats when in September newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently carried away one of the stone parallelepipeds weighing on average 80 kilograms whose value is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still piled up in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took away everything that could get into the trunk and the trailers.
These scandal stones from Stuttgart have long since been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"wouldn't have been this political component."
He enters his all-terrain car, goes around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He went on to study law, which he dropped out of, and later began studying biology before eventually becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a career.
And a stone lover.
It stocks 40,000 tons.
He amasses treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's restraining himself.
Sand stones carved with art are laid on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a heap of fingers: Red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And so on.
"Pretty travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt coming from the police prefecture, the reddish granite coming from the cathedral St. Blasius, the tuff coming from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that stones were once carved by hand and moved with simple hoists and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be torn apart."
He did not become rich, much less rich.
But this quarry now employs 14 people. In addition, stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon, he must go to Cologne.
There are stones to be saved, too.
Fighting talent to conquer high potential
The counter is very crowded.
16 students scramble to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and whitewash.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of a kind of idea contest, they have to talk business about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, get to know the Volkswagen company.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand-in-hand in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most gifted graduates as much as possible in the amphitheaters before they reach the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talents in practical projects and retain them.
On the second day of the workshop held at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group attracted talent.
A young lady from the personnel department shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs to young talents; she shows them the paths to access the group premises.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
“As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know students, take a closer look at serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as collaborators.”
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we seek to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more bitter.
In sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a large number of candidates.
But they must boast of their reliability and above all court the highly skilled workforce.
Above all, graduates from engineering courses are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI's forecast, the gap in engineering jobs will widen even further.
Roman Dykta goes talent hunting on behalf of KPMG, an auditing, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The person who is to participate decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the quest for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
“We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race.”
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
“Until now, we’ve been in touch with everyone who took part in a similar action last year.”
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to address their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct on-campus tapping, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a quite classic way by participating in trade fairs where they engage in brain-hunting.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
“For example, at the Solar Technology Show,” says Sitha Stübe, head of human resources at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company based in Bonn employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are submitted to the competition on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he said.
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Freiburg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to undertake professional internships or write his/her final project of study with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are advertised among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do that," said Stübe, chief of staff.
For a long time, money has not been the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotional opportunities are other determinants.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual honorary board for German employers.
To this end, it asks employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of the employees.
The Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among job seekers.
“I think candidates rely mostly on external assessments of a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to make themselves attractive is to go through their own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, that is, the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
“Satisfied employees make the best messengers.”
When they treat their employees well and identify with the company, they advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” says Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida in the southeastern United States in the coming years.
The Washington government has pronounced a ban an equivalent ban and thus definitively rescinded its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is currently prohibited.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April is the cause of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with the accident, which claimed the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize the realization of new drillings in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating black tide in golf has not, to date, been definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces multibillion-dollar claims, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the freeze on drilling decreed after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after numerous corruption allegations, is currently undergoing extensive reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would remove them from the lucrative tax niches of the oil and gas groups.
The players in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the supply flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to the result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the audit firm BDO, ahead of the drilling ban pronounced Wednesday.
In fact, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water that flows into the rivers is brown oiled; it emits a smell similar to the one that exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live by theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
“Don’t get exhausted,” the environmental activist told reporters to calm them down: “You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man plunged into muddy water up to his chest, as well as the greasy trail that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the rainbow-colored burst of water.
It is not noticeable that the basement is full of brown crude oil.
On the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom says she used to collect shrimp in whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil sprang from an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the small town of Bodo must now row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the ravages comes to the fore as you walk through the mangrove marshes crossed by streams.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat splits a crumbling brown water. Anyone who plunges his hand into it removes it all covered with oil.
The roots of young mangroves emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. Isolated palms sadly let their palms hang.
Birds are sought in vain, as they are usually found in wetlands: Once the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence strikes this paradise of yesteryear that resembles a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is war on the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari sadly: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield besieged for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. it was later executed. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its production activities in this region. dangerous because they had become very employed
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines in the entire Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are untapped, because this situation is too unstable for oil.
Every few hundred meters steel trellises rise in the water like bizarre sculptures: The heads of drill holes are affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most are gnawed by corrosion to the marker.
Akpobari believes that a drill head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts’ estimates, more than two billion litres have spilled over the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to the amount that went into the sea in the 21-year-old Exxon Valdez super-oil tanker crash off the coast of Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should bear the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and siphoning of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, while environmentalists consider drillhead explosions and perforated pipelines to be the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner reproached the Shell group for applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of conduct failures is "even much higher than allure".
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of swallows and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with swallows up to the neck.
A fire sparks under one of the many barrels that sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without a motif on the site must be spotted: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, the gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, at the end of the pipe, the drops of kerosene fall and finally diesel is obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre barrels of diesel a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low one of barely 40 cents of Euro per liter of Diesel: Because they acquire their raw material for free.
According to experts, the country is losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the whole of the Niger Delta.
Only a small but insignificant part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military personnel, load the lion’s share into tankers and fry it onto the world market.
Activist Akpobari believes that the debate over whether to attribute environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries.”
But, meanwhile, the Ogoni's relations with Shell have deteriorated to such an extent that it was no longer a question of withdrawing from the group. "maybe operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will turn out to be better."
Michael is getting nervous.
“It’s high time for you to pee,” announces the rugged oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are caught by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to benefit like all Nigerians from the raw material.
"In every way, this damn thing has brought our country down," Akpori said.
Investigators Find Construction Defects in A380 Reactors
The A380 clearly suffers from a major security problem.
By examining a plane that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that can lead to “catastrophic reactor failure.”
The airline Qantas now wants to file a lawsuit against the manufacturer of the reactor.
At the beginning of November, passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had visibly had more luck so far: During the investigation that it conducted, the Australian authority in charge of air safety found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and it warns against a possible defect in construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks at the connection of the oil pipe, said in a statement published Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic reactor failure".
This includes Rolls-Royce-manufactured reactors with 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Quantas company’s Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing on November 4 in Singapore, was among them.
The Australian airline has now filed lawsuits against the British reactor manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas director Alan Joyce said his company would seek damages in connection with the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, oil ignition is the cause of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that more safety-related tests will be carried out on the superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue is considered sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had grounded its entire fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily stopped three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced the A380 as a precautionary measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
The snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the entire country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany shiver: With freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered in snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, winter service personnel worked on a permanent basis, but they were unable to cope with the steadily accumulating snow.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves to occur on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow piles on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the weather alert center Meteomedia announced the violet alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and cool winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious disruption to the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind disrupted traffic and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall has hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, trees fallen on railway tracks, catenaries or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, interregional transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers of the train with blankets, food and beverages.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesperson for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no longer many passengers trapped at the airport, despite this barely 400 beds are made available to them.
Accidents occurred on several roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car barreled on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists are announcing good news: The snow will always be soft and dusty, but it will swirl in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by strong and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's headquarters: The twin towers located in the Business District have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly looking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to put them back on lease at a later date."
Germany’s largest financial institution has already ceded its seat, shortly after.
It was not until mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers in the amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the holders of its own funds and then rehabilitated them.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization have, according to some indications, engulfed around 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, meanwhile renamed "Green Towers", at about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the children who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for the buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions that occurred in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been retrieved because the safety situation in the disaster well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinking well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue teams were able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the minors had no chance of surviving.
Until now, the bodies could not be recovered.
Today, parents and friends organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth in the south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothes and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were raised in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative party that New Zealand has nurtured hopes that the miners will rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said he cannot resign himself to accepting his son’s death until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Miners of South African and British origin were also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers have begun extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand’s South Island.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the ancient genre with his film, "Walhalla Rising", epic of the fighter.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A dead Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his adversaries one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of a bad action. Just because our hero is using brutal killing methods, he-he's going to kill them.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind man does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, at the turn of one or two sentences some terrible cries of agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and we celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that forms the setting of the universe of the Vikings, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travellings.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy about the fierce and stylish drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to art and rehearsal cinema.
Most art cinema sympathizers must experience horror in the face of the surrounding brain and intestines.
Lovers of action movies die of boredom, when the blind man embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributors in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not about dialogues in this film, nor about coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The spectator cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with freezing images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who faithfully stands beside the dull, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning himself into a warrior, is perhaps the devil's envoy himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, just for those who are, anyway, rotting.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, whose purpose is annoyance, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new information on a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007 at about midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest nearby city is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in IAEA documents, because it refers to the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a briefing by the US intelligence services, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring locality, el-Kibar, would be well able to produce plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video with blurred satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component prior to the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even inside it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is barely more information available than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery thickens more and more.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had little evidence that the country was developing “an active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about it and only speak of a “presumed reactor”, even though they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible”.
They lack tangible evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how he made sure he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior U.N. diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer, saying the IAEA had “enough documents to ask questions.”
The Syrians certainly hastily removed the rubble of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of human-produced uranium in al-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received through a Member State satellite images of commercial providers showing the moment that directly followed the attack. it seems that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found at the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analyzing the particles, calling it implausible.
Since that time, Damascus has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow the controllers to carry out a second inspection at the site of el-Kibar and denies access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister-in-Office at the time of the attack, recently said: “We will never comment on this.”
Thus, the investigation into this case has been ongoing since June 2008 without reaching a result and it is "increasingly turning into a serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as acknowledged by a high-ranking Western diplomat serving at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, in the end it is a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA believes that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
To date, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities are here, what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariyah also from the names of neighboring cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be at or directly adjacent to a military base, which is exactly why Syria is denying IAEA inspectors access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is alleged that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
Actually, it was intelligence provided by U.S. intelligence agents that caught the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could “serve for fuel production.”
It would have "no indications concerning sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are indispensable to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions about the fundamental questions of where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would have been later separated.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide high-value traces, was stored at all three sites.
When the hundreds of truckloads of dirt are gone, no one will have information on where the debris is stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for storing radioactive waste.
Recently analyzing satellite photos taken for the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked them to the reactor in question.
Satellite photos, however, show Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspect sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to those sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to rule out suspicions.
It was said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA had spent several months developing a plan for the inspections to be carried out there, which was intended to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows how much interest the inspectors have in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be signalled for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States who has been talking for a few months about what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful means that the Atomic Agency has at its disposal to put into action.
IAEA Director Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, as that diplomat who gives to reflect: "What good would it do, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
It’s been bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut in the summer as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a Bosnian woman and a man of Serbian descent.
Nothing else is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav War.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested, in response to which some of the filming sequences scheduled for Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at the last minute.
In the meantime, the film is being shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims Organization corresponded with Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet with the actress.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she offered to meet these women in Hungary, but they declined.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie’s storyline says a lot about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that she withdraw her goodwill ambassadorship to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has received copies of her script, has after some hesitation granted filming permission in Sarajevo, but it is not known why she did not come afterwards despite this permission.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of efforts that she became aware of the Yugoslav conflict, she argues that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all parties involved to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This makes a big difference to the version "a rape victim falls in love with his executioner".
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, Jolie says, is "unjust and based on erroneous information."
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: illegally putting this scenario on the net, like many others before.
Let's go!
Tonight, everything is going well again with the Irish.
No sign of consternation.
This is why the local team over-dominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream for joy against a backdrop of loud music, they stagger with their feet.
Baileyu-Pub of Cork in South Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "Beer Pong". The winner pockets 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to go to attend the World Beer Pong Championships in January in Las Vegas.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really do not go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrifying question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his plans. In January, he will lead hiring interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling,” he says.
"The homeland is so far away and I have no job."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Due to the bleak prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin now holds a position as a computer consultant in London.
The young people leave: The situation of most of the families living on the island is similar to that of the tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research say 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even forecast a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are fulfilled, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now takes over.
The economic crisis, however, affects mainly the well-trained young Irish, who have so far experienced only moments of happiness.
Job loss and social decay seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everybody had a job, there's money in excess.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes extensively letters from readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is drifting."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity goes away and our country goes away for a generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students Union, sees a bleaker future because the government is just throwing powder in the eyes and offering no prospects for the future for young people.
“They cut minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She sees how her comrades cling from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She says her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon organizes the exhibition "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers full support on the theme "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers to the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the official.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a chore, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Seán O’Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house emerges from the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects in Hanover or Berlin.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional workstation, in order to be able to complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in the home country.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he says as he crosses the threshold of his home for the first time in a long time.
“I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore.”
He bursts with an embarrassed laugh as he walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O’Donovan bought the house together with his sister for a sum of 380,000 euros, financed 100 percent by credit.
“These were moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid to see it all fall apart because of credit?
O'Donovan reflects for a moment, rinses hot tea and says, "I don't have children to support and I'm young; even everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations that he often hears lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island," he said.
“Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe that’s what makes us feel Irish at first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years, and in Ireland life was just going on."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leaving the future and discovering how life happens elsewhere.
In his list, he already has a few years of work in London, which is why life does not have to be so easy in New Zealand for him and for his girlfriend.
But there is one more thing that has worried him in recent days: the party to be organized on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid she might turn into a farewell party.
“Only not a lot of emotions,” he said while drinking a long sip of beer.
"A goodbye, that sounds worrying."
"Let's call it rather a farewell evening, all relaxed, bringing together a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it monitors changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after suffering a sharp decline in output last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region’s two most populous countries, are convinced Democrats, lowering the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44 per cent of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase over 25 per cent in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
If this has held up during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in the Americas have suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and declined again this year, to 32 percent.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have worsened.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31 per cent say they or someone close to them has been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38 per cent last year and the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even though their leftist president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the biggest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A Dirty Vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country, which had been devastated and plunged into fear.
Voting boxes and a new ballot were introduced, ballots scattered in the gutters, polling stations looted, and intimidation
The polling stations opened late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced by the January earthquake, were roaming the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event to be "a pretty good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they did not “believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reaches the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there were fears that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 ID cards, necessary to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a legitimate popular government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, has enjoyed a wave of public sympathy that has improved her approval rating from 20 points to more than 50 percent, its highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning that into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Mrs. Fernández’s choice, visibly in mourning, whether or not she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
In this regard, the signs remain confusing.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Mrs. Fernández’s government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has plunged into disarray following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian slapped one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, giving the president even more room to spend at will.
The economy is vastly overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage demands see this figure close to 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit next year's pay rises to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by high world prices for Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the growth boost following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms Fernandez seems to be edding towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices; which looks like a prelude to the sanitation of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether Ms. Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If it does, it needs to gain the support of the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have ebbed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, quietly, her husband’s many policies.
A half hour for China
Taiwanese voters have moved towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, or 70 percent of eligible people, ran on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is seen as a general assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for sentiments towards the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the biggest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but only recently.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayoralties, it failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has leaned towards complete independence from Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT by 45%.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of Taiwanese elections, including trucks with loud campaigns and mass rally flags with girls dancing in minimal attire.
An attempted compulsory mysterious assassination was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, injuring him and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking how absent the question of the mainland itself was.
Instead, candidates have toyed with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and detests China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stirring up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan’s economic survival.
Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to deceive Taiwan, back to the flock.
China wasted no time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it would also like to see political integration; but let us begin at the beginning.
Better wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was in bad shape: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favor of explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that they too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presents a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems infuriated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said PDP candidates would have performed better if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will find it difficult to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite vertiginous economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and widening the gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson said his office and local offices would be revamped.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, “the point of no return has already passed.”
Grammy Award Nominations: Jazz Singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to take note of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of this year's Grammy Awards with a major nomination in the "best new artist" category.
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skilful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding compared to the blazing success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the last few years of the Graymm electorate.
Elsewhere, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity” in the “instrumental album” category, a spin on a refreshing thrill of a recording that was one of last year’s prime favorites.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite of the hoarse voice of New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; which is also strongly inclined towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the savage Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, has earned some well-deserved recognition in the big ensemble category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" from his live octet was a fine example of the democratic hand of this bassist as leader.
Grammy Award Nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey Lead in Classical Categories
Classical nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes from musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, with five "yeses"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yeses".
Nominees with links to Southern California include Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles," a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto by Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also vying for an award.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the Classic Producer of the Year features five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; and "Schottery" of the Various Artists.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Far Away" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin's Orchestra
Composers in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute work is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he was soon writing the 15-minute work especially for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
“I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms from North Africa,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists nominated include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-solo nominees; these are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixes, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project was approved by the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics attacked the project by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
“A lot of good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha’is, you mention it,” Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
“I’m proud of it as an American citizen.”
"This shows that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, for the most part, people voting for or against the center, speaking time roughly equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” one speaker wrote.
“This is another planet of apes with Miss Liberty dead in the sand.”
“America has fallen.”
The planned Islamic centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of about 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet tall.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral high school.
Opponents can still appeal this bill to the City Council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That’s why it’s very special, even if it’s far from a truly ‘foreign’ life form,” said Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday’s online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers have found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“We wonder what is still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important when it comes to searching for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery “shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the ‘standard’ set of elements, which we deem absolutely necessary for life, might not be fixed,” said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute for Planetary and Space Science Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell wasn't on the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It was not a chance discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances might be able to substitute for one another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms have a hard time distinguishing these elements separately."
“But arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and sort of erases the work of our biochemical machine,” Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea, that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common in the early days of Earth's existence, she says; so the researchers hypothesized that early life forms might have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The Last Two Stolen Show Dogs Found in Compton
The other two show dogs on four robbed from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, Los Angeles County Sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs — two Welsh akitas and two Pembroke corgis — went missing Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late on Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Steve Whitmore told reporters.
“The good news is that the dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good shape.”
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is underway."
“We don’t want to say it,” Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached to provide a comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas — Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female — were safe and sound, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the Long Beach "AKC/Eukanuba" national championship, where they planned to introduce Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the couple's nearly a month-long canine exhibition tour stops.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton Spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs could get some fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is unclear whether a prize was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM awaits only the final green light from the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially praised the “pre-packaged” plan by creditors that would clear about $5 billion of the debt; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and television shows.
With Thursday’s decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, there is no longer any legal hurdle left before MGM to resurface under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will be a lightweight studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase concludes a $500 million credit facility to fund MGM's new operations and productions.
It is currently being licensed by the $75 million investment bank and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it could not afford to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Moelis and Cooper to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the $2 billion more that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially went bankrupt in the following weeks, the Moelis and Cooper companies received multi-million dollar rewards for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper companies, which raised $375,000 per month for their corporate leadership services, will receive a $4 million “success premium.”
Barber and Birnbaum plan to revive MGM’s production, which released only one film this year, and build an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released starting in 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio has to make a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, has attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Toys to Keep Your Gifts Budget Balanced
Although the top candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant breach in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic beads jumping ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers—Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us, and BJ’s Wholesale Club—to see the electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known of their kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and up) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when you squeeze them on the belly.
One pressure is equal to one note, and a second allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Be careful: once you start pushing, you can’t stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative wheel-locked articulated feet.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3+ years), with a backpack filled with questionnaire game cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve binder.
If you are suspicious when your child is holding your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
The Mobigo from VTech ($60, for 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years old), this is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3-7 year olds) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books, and comes with an SD card input for viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8+) is a set of five blocks just over the size of a matchbox, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, this is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based solely on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Club Penguin pet online, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 year olds) which includes a coin marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be roller skates or a Puffle toy pet.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and over) is the latest button-stacked micro-robots.
The fake beast moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to maintaining order in China
Tang Shenbin walked through a town square as an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nervous loads, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - imposing public order officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence - to convey some impression to a set of spectators.
"Stand upright!"
"Be sharp!"
Show them, he said, "what the pretty girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed their teens in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-coloured jackets and trousers, froze at your guard.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the ruler.
Four neat hats perfectly perched on top of hair tied by a striped knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they look average," Tang said, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a graduate degree.
Guangdong Province traded the grey-green uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the drop-eyes with the strong way:: In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the peddler packed up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to do a large imaging operation.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its urban street police with 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, curve and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have trouble catching the eye on China’s underground urban brigade
And for good reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media is portraying the news from a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and put online, outlined how to effectively defeat offenders without shedding blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon hawker was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game imbued with violence, available for download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
“Chengguan has marked the government,” China Daily, a national publication, said last year after yet another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real clean-up."
Skeptics say the approach is a long way off.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether women had real tasks or were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required female candidates, ages 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five facial features in the right order."
They should be above average in size, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
Officers said the work was too physically painful for women over the age of 25.
“It’s their image that’s important,” a certain district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they are suitable; it is about the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities."
The women of the Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city’s district management office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case of the requirement relating to the order of the features of the face.
That it means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, disabled or disfigured persons should not apply.
“We can’t let a lame person or a hump come and serve here,” Zheng said.
"It wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks mauled with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
“Do you think I look sexy in that uniform?” she asked disillusionedly.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old dimple colleague, says: “Our job is to present the image of the city.”
They are not opposed to having their mandate limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply chasing the sellers into the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team confronts a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many rolls or bowls of tofu as possible before escaping.
"Master Wang, you must go."
“We’ve told you several times before,” Xu said as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle cart bike.
The officers described their duties as monotonous rather than arduous.
“It’s pretty much the same thing every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate property from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after the spread of false rumors that chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police and chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were knocked over or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from Placid Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the sinister-faced policemen wrestled their way to their vehicle and set off at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 and over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not indict Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case involving a former campaign assistant and his efforts to get a lobbying job for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The ruling ends the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a potential Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Mr Ensign’s office said he was “very happy” with the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Department of Justice had "informed Senator Ensign that he is no longer being investigated and that he does not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there was significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, over the senator’s affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
As Mr. Hampton had recently been an employee of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law for one year from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to contradict the so-called lobbying revolving door ban.
“There appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the revolving door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of a government investigation.
Although the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecution after a number of high-level setbacks by its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop prosecution of the former senator.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the Chief Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that has received several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s lead lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call Monday from a Justice Department prosecutor and follow-up the next day, telling him the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Ensign’s team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, “had acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins declined to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutor's office.
“I’m not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Justice Department, except to say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Ensign’s parents’ payment of $96,000 to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "hammering" the Home Office on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as fourth-ranking Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Department of Justice's lead and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue her hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were tapping away in the rows of the courtroom.
They were sending horrific testimonial reports every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape case trial and the children attached to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines arguments for appeal, likely to occupy the courts for years to come.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial – as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists – have created a “circus atmosphere”, a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury was badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could prompt appeal judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I experienced it in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms is infringing on human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer for Hayes, Chief Counsel.
Trial judge Jon C. Bleue of the State Superior Court laconically rejected the claims in last week’s ruling, saying the media were “prudently controlled” and there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the issue.
Courts of appeal have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 judgment, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his ruling that there was a “carnival atmosphere at trial” because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have argued that appeal courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage courtroom media, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
“There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media” in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it has been arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue says some appeal judges may be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
Twitter's case is just one of many described by Hayes's lawyers, likely to be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defense lawyers also argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes was allegedly harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during jury selection.
Some jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and that he improperly pressured for a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate on a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They maintained that the computer media kept stoking the flames of the emotion of the case.
“The daily squabble of media tweets, cameras and journalists outside the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “was nothing like what had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their focus on Twitter system coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said the claim that snapshots were more incendiary than slower releases was a luddite view that would impoverish the Court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appeals courts were often drawn to arguments that social and technological change required court adaptation.
Mr. Hayes’s lawyers insist on this claim.
In their file, they make a reference to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling that reversed Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they made it clear that they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can civility bring cleavages closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a warning sign of genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the major issues that need to be addressed during the “lame duck” session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the committee on the president’s deficit was equally civilized, despite political differences that remain among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect transcending the ideological gap; but which, however, still divides the members.
This is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of mutual trial and testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That’s why Tuesday’s meeting and subsequent comments from participants unveiled a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, expenses, health care or fees, both sides remain miles apart.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed in tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
“This is inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions and then fade away.
That's good."
On certain issues, notably those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is hovering over a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "lame duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "blade duck" session will not necessarily lead to better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done are done, the psychology in the short term will come back to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to true cooperation.
“I consider most of what’s going on between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to them, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected representatives, suggesting that there are, at least today, few grounds or willingness to compromise on tax issues.
Galston foresees two phases in the fighting between the White House and Congressional Republicans.
The first will come in the form of partisan clashes next year, as Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care; followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
The one who will be judged at a loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would still be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more substantial election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked U.S. documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a “kleptocracy” and sends some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the U.S. embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out massive racketeers that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was drafted while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has been little clearance since.
Lujkov and his wife, Elena Baturina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the corruption charges over the years; and he has won several defamation lawsuits over these charges.
In September, he told a Russian television channel the following, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s thrown away, it’s anything.”
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information set out in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be to diplomats of a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it “dysfunctional” and to claim that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government,” according to the embassy note.
The criminal elements enjoy a “krysha” (term used in the criminal world/mafia that literally means “roof” or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor’s office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
“Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt detectives are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report indicates that the FSB brews money from the largest companies and that the police target the small ones.
A source, he said, “explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only do they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law.”
“That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high.”
The note points out that although the collection of money is extensive, the protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly see their business shut down under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption but he has admitted little progress.
The note from the embassy sends reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev is dependent on bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow's think tank Indem, said in a recent interview.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
“It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indeem, the costs of corruption in Russia as a whole would amount to more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least to most corrupt).
The release of the US embassy note, which was only made yesterday late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Lujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow’s failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by Larry King on CNN, Putin hypothesized that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to the statements that U.S. diplomats had leaked by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that this is our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect that it would be accomplished with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics.”
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Face the Past
In a poorly lit classroom with poor quality decrepit concrete walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School evoked the man who built it, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty to Anlong Veng is finally called into question.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum enabled victims to face the people who had participated in the regime publicly.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former Khmer Rouge member, sentenced to 35 years in prison the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Yev, better known as "Duch".
In the face of this evolving situation, anxiety increased among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their desire to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the United Pol Pot government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were leading the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the Khmer Rouge veterans have sunk into the black misery common to rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers have retained their local leadership positions in exchange for laying down arms, these are unskilled farmers at low grade and record.
“These people benefited from very little follow-up after the capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbued with the regime's agrarian utopian ideology."
“They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for our own needs.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused trouble here.
The court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, early next year.
The court's mandate is to prosecute senior officials and those primarily responsible for the crimes but it has not said whether it will continue beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, 64, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at Cambodia’s Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers were reportedly killed.
Recently, on a hot evening, Im Chaem was returning from work in the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is peaceful and stable,” she said.
“If there is more prosecution, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the documentation centre.
“The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces,” he said.
“We have to put these pieces together so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, Composed of 75 Pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history textbooks, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the youth of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
“They are suspicious because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful appeal here.
In the heights of the Dangrek Mountains, a path, overgrown with weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads up to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside mobile phone seller, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many of the inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot’s last resting place where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up stockpile of military-grade uranium
The Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component for nuclear weapons, as part of a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world.
The agreement was leaked in a joint statement released after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been conducted with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for a deal Wednesday to eliminate the remaining material of about 500 pounds, according to an official who referred to the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, hosted at Obama’s initiative; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to provide an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit of 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves to me that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the agreement a “very significant, important step” by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept high enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and low enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“It’s our product ... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We’re going to use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus got closer to the United States a few months ago; however, showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus’ research facilities with weakly enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
“Meticulous coordination and organization has been put in place to build trust,” leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Energy Department specializing in Reducing the Global Threat.
According to estimates by the James Martin Center for the Study of Non-Proliferation, Belarus this year had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
“While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improving bilateral relations; and indispensable to the progress of the country and its citizens,” she said.
The government has not objected to the CIA’s flights.
The government has not raised any objections to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cable) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed in order "to be able to demonstrate that they exercised adequate vigilance on foreign planes passing through Spain".
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights abuses, a meeting was held between former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had surprised Zapatero's government out of the picture" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to the theft of intelligence over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken unprepared," Aguirre said in a cable.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, informed the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (NIC) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
“These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information,” the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown its concern for "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007 during a luncheon between the US ambassador and the interior minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a rhetorical rhetoric".
The ambassador also expresses his concern for the PP's action in this case.
“Despite its broad pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that Zapatero’s government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” she said.
The parricide who went to confession complained in a network of the "overwhelming" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used when she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; both from Noia, the village of A Coruña from which she originated.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you have to know his love life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with industrialist Iván Túñez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, we found out she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to probe the labor market, the little one stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is understood that their idyll has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and vexed by the fact that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed like a good thing, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then, she talks about a mobile message that she had just received: "I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send the child to you."
Ella complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she alleges.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to show up at a workstation so as not to lose it".
She explains that if everything went well, she would have taken her eldest with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother,” she said.
In July, there is another post.
When she taped him, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and had supposedly been murdered on the 10th, died.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other."
“On one side he’s with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day.”
She's talking about a trip to Majorca.
“He’ll be there a few hours in the summer and so I’ll save some money from the babysitter.”
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
“Alberto says he sent you I don’t know what videos to the email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit.”
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He's advancing me money."
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Terror to the Galician (epigraph) ".
The last man who lived with her, watches, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything was over so she didn’t tell him the fact that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered yesterday the provincial penitentiary of Palma, coming from the judicial detainee center of Menorca.
The ex officio lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "and she did not intend to harm the minor either."
Before that she had confessed to having drowned Caesar in the bathtub and placed his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People’s Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies registered in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general elections because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation obtains in these elections normally doubles that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes at the general elections of 2008, while at the autonomous elections of 2006, they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the CPP received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend is maintained, which is desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this formation calculated the fact that, if there were a general election, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also gain four (it has now neither 10 MPs) and PSC would lose 9 MPs (it has neither more nor less).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - there are three now - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda holds, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal rallies, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both the nationalists and the popular agree that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority either to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful for this party to lose its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes from PSC, of which the mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
The people also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Aside from the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerien detained by agents of the General Information Commissariat of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell which, headed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaeda groups, among them "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last of which caused the death of the Tamil people.
The Ministry of the Interior gave great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with “Operation Kampai” was “weakened” the al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and “therefore, its operative capacity”.
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its “combatants” could cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, that is why the investigations involved, apart from Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days similar blows to the one recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerien Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), in Thailand another operation was carried out, with the capture of the Pakistanis Eh-Ze-Lan and the Si-Ki-Ki-Bun.
They were the ones who ran the cell implanted in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the conditions set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found connecting the detainees in Catalonia with the bombing of Bombay, even if the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia it was sent through a transfer agency a few miles of dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used later by the members of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have obtained a wealth of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which are summed up to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of adventures philo-sovereignist approaching his mandate as is the nationalist economic complicity that the directs.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty that he obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the nomination.
From a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists wish to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are done in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an investiture "we should eliminate all the sovereignist and independenceist discourses", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wants to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to weaken the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the investiture of Mas will be dealt with by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciudadanos) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says that the deaths were not due to the "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The heads of the geriatrics La Caritat of Olot (Girona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the interval that he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" for the dead, but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And aside from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not detecting the night nurse’s criminal activities in time, the great threat to La Caritat is now taking the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the victims’ parents are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that since that day he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrics - which he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only one indication of recklessness on the part of any person other than the accused".
The person already baptized as the "Angel of Death" confessed yesterday to 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused her death by injecting an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the staff of the center to medicines.
Insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the internees, used to kill them.
But the lab tests will clarify whether Vila is not lying by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Tribunal of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain available to justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet’s threat that “markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
The differentials of the peripherals closed to force and the shares of the European banks suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must also not underestimate the ECB’s ability to be wrong and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way that it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by closings of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded the finalization of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond-buying program will continue and even be given the signal to step up.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
As during their May meeting in which they claimed they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the auction of milkings at one year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only $500 million at 5.28% compared to $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the Allied Hole and Bank of Ireland figures have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to the ears of investors like Vivaldi’s four seasons.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that this will resolve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain asking for a Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has more than $40,000 billion in liquidity available, three times more than in March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to the markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "apart from being, appearing."
Courage, we can get away with it!
The president of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, because he considers it "null of right", the judicial council of El Enebro next 16, requested by five of its seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the company holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their litigation for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company for the companies does not appear to be willing to give in in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors at the meeting of shareholders of January 18 this year whose challenge is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunder within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the assembly.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the plaintiffs his five sons to try, through procedural arguing, by clearly defrauding the Law and abusing the right, to validate and correct the assembly radically void on January 18", according to his official spokes.
This argument will be the basis for, once the meeting takes place, to be contested considering that it is "of right nullity".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless seeks usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for challenge for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with Siemens secret weapon
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one considered the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last few seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without decreasing the skill as a driver of the champion, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from the high competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines for manufacturing plants around the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to replicate, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding defects and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi planes or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant has allowed Red Bull to create and execute “in a few hours, almost in real time” the modifications, changes and improvements detected during the races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the cars.
The CEO of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all the elements of the Red Bull cars except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be made from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a town 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered top secret.
The staff for this task is 580 people, including two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula 1 hero, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drinks brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the notoriety zero.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D progress in the case of race cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will count this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the redesigned store located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to implement 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openers were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering global pilot program that solves possible issues with HP’s warranty IT equipment.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, because large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," noted Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' a million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
In spite of this, it foresees a collapse of interest margins, which will be partially offset by increments in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, its task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will last for three years.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to public subsidies from FROB, is to gain a market share by capturing one million new private customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank - its great task to accomplish, because until now this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the private customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the bet on productivity, or what is the same thing, on austerity, with cost reduction as the objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks now dare to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima master plan, established four years ago, even though initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for one more year.
Customers who let out savings banks will be its main focus.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even though he believes that the liability war – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and credit unions pay for its issuances to obtain liquidity is already moving at the price of credit to compensate for the drop in margins.
“The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a credit pressure factor.”
"We haven't tightened the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the banking sector’s trend now “is to increase commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger dimensions will be requested."
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He says capital needs are “increasing enormously” and some Spanish financial entity could go red.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closing of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that one cannot issue, but unlike what happened in June, one can obtain short-term financing through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the credit unions
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings banks and again stressed the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the merger of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Funds (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been made, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of it has been done completely; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," said the leader.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is being carried out in the deadlines that have been set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain".
“The shift from 45 caisses with an average of 28,500 million assets volume to 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be compliant with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a series of rather unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remind that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and he attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a process of concentration "very important" and "goes at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector did well with the stress tests that the ECB underwent in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin opted to stay in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Market tensions have provoked a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private employment agencies or elimination of the 426 euros of aid to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins Chancellor Angela Merkel’s criticism of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another constraint on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if now it seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, nearly 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal rigour, fines to countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (fiscal rigour and fiscal stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The Central European country’s second blow was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
Since then it has been the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for reform of the EU treaties to make it possible to rescue a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat softened, has been approved, and in the months ahead we should be witnessing the EU reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not be too much in agreement, from that date onwards the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in default and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany tells us that we need to follow a strong growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we're being asked for is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring greater tranquility to us.
And let us know how to seize the opportunity that we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it in this form and his dual statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with big business and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, the path has been opened to the thesis that it is necessary to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don’t seem to move it.
And among the possibilities envisaged, we cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone too drunk of countries that are not serious.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us about it.
Sport and Law Fraud
The tricks similar to those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the willingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused a lot of ink to flow on the unsportsmanlike character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is known, just minutes before finishing the match (which their team already clearly won), both players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction during the next match of the playoff match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and different amounts of money to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that emerged in the related case is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his anthem displays nobility and honor and who in past occasions has condemned to a fine his players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by the more provocative and historical episode, by Mourinho, who adds to his de
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation, which contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say, whether these actions are committed as a fraud of law, because, indeed, they are actions respectful of the sport regulation, but seem to elude its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sporting mind.
One of the assets that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been endangered, that is to say, there has not been a violent game.
Another of these assets referred to with correct play is to prevent the team of the offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out secretly to try to avoid the sanction, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty from the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of benefit that offenders get from the intentional misconducts examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that you do not put the opponent at a disadvantage and you do not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action assumes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And that’s not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, climbing the ladder, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, of which strategic decisions that promote profit to the maximum of what the rules allow are still part.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), otherwise they chose instead the time in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without thwarting the penalty or running away from it.
Even though the boundary between genius and law fraud is blurred, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way of transmitting the director to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The calendar dictatorship is concentrating this year an avalanche of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December arrives also returns the group dinners before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which due to the crisis have resulted in an offensive price adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals of men, coincide the business.
To complete complicating accounting, this year's calendar (as New Year's Eve falls on Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying out of their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they are all asking for battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer’s representative, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
“They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he said.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a ladder with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey in various institutions of the center we see the collapse of applications for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the pretense of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the economic situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has assumed more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they said.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting an increase in turnover since the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, like the Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies inviting their employees again and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased a bit.
On the part of the Fecasarm patronage (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association), its vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That’s true, hope for the festivities hasn’t waned, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country".
WikiLeaks leaks confirm connection between Taliban and Pakistan
The contents of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirm the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program is causing in Washington.
Aside from the enlightening and tasty details that offer about the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, is "declining" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
The ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of the former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is short and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain guard.
“Pakistan has been hiring staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the falling educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said during a meeting with his US counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani degree of production of nuclear weapons.
An embassy dispatch in May, which calls communication with Pakistan "frustrating", argues that "transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are being eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence official for South Asia, noted that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups".
The Hunt for the WikiLeaks Leader
Obama will appoint a senior counter-terrorism official to prevent further infiltration.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All the aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have a certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, this is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
WikiLeaks’s creative lawyer, Mark Stephens, said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
The international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Interpol’s 188 countries have been instructed to identify or locate Assange “in order to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot issue an arrest warrant for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red notice appeal a free path to arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they find a bilateral extradition agreement.
The move outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder’s willingness to respond by videoconference to questions from Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
“This appears to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him – and in Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he does not remain silent.
On Monday he gave an indeterminate interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates who are spying on the UN by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has charged a senior anti-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s spokesman’s attempt to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance.”
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to back down on his statements after saying Assange should “be murdered.”
“Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something like that.”
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor and possible presidential candidate.
“Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to Carod supporters
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for solving yet another internal revolt within ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other currents extinct.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticism with nods that allow him to armor himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of ERC will be able to pronounce on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he said that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a "Bulgarian-style" result would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand from the president a little more than making his position available to the militancy, a gesture that is not worthwhile when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the National Council for a vote on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the latter's promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a safe fact.
The leader of ERC has admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash its laundry room with the family.
In this line, the article that the current councillor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he points out two.
The first, "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new figures that come from the sector adept of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as an operating mechanism.
Thus, he advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of Puigcercós’ team, which has already struggled in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive 2008 conclave tasked management with revising the assembly model in a specific statute reform congress.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time might be right to take it back and shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 executed in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two cut bodies in Valle de México.
During the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 deaths theoretically related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the stroke of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle in Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
Very early Thursday morning, the four landowners of jointly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal gunshots in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight gunshots as he was leaving his house to start the garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a gunshot to the head each in the colony San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shotgun in the forehead we found the corpse of a man on a lonely road from Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet struck with a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency bodies conducted a thorough search of the rest of the body's members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán have alerted to the discovery of a corpse that was in Peña Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound to the neck.
In the middle of the month it was reported the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, at the same time two death warning messages were discovered along with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan was located who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left aside.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots to the neck, the body of a woman was found dead in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman we detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the side of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with a blunt head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what happens with those who do not align".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next to it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, officers found a Bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of this country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its greenhouse gas emissions.
China is continuing its bid to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent before 2020, said Su Wei, China’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and reconvert its industry.
In fact, he explained, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nonetheless, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He noted that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and pilot programme support.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Act that recognizes the goals being addressed in reducing greenhouse gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with government and local governments to achieve energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction goals.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficient Use Program, which has been implemented for the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by economy lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific advisor on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than people think.
For example, he explained, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Likewise, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar one by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is lawful.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the Commission of National Order to demand what is lawful.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's taking of protests as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the deportation of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission of Order of Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on December 4 and 5, when a successor should be elected.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and has achieved its goal,” he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary "we savor it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that no doubt the council will be able to elect the best leader Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the succession "to the person determined by the council."
“I am completely calm and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five.”
He predicted that the revival recorded by the party in the elections last July 4 will be reflected on the next dispute, even if "this is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the moment, it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made "a lot of hopes regarding them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four-year rule, César Nava asked the PRI to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; let them start defending them; let them come out of the closet,” he said.
He said that the incumbent of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Audience, because in the country there is no gag, let alone censorship.
Obama promotes law on Twitter for undocumented students
“If you agree with the passing of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama met today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
“If you agree with the passing of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message maintains an open cybernetic link with a broader document that asks the public to immediately contact senators, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
“With a vote we hope to have soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,” he said.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the Bush-era extension of tax cuts and government funding continue.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agenda can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
“We all agree that we need to solve this tax problem before the end of the year.”
“I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would ask for a “debate-closing vote” for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, though most likely next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they stayed in that country for the last five years and they were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the help of a large number of Republicans, at a time when supporters of the project are lobbying intensely to ensure the passage of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nonetheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed his term with Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his stance so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put our finger on the wound
The second stage of Les Plaisirs de la langue was a walk in which participants showcased the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to sex).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in embarrassment," the Argentine writer gently launched to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what is the "wound", she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who took his breath away in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is opened in reality, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed with relief and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is the one who is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and the traps of the language must be very related to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a charming narrative that he titled Praise for the Invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous sorceress who touched clouds, turned people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turns to speak later America, the great news that had from the beginning its own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses.
“Cervantes, who invented us all, mocked the false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a proper way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that lacked even modesty.”
Nevertheless, he pointed out, "fools and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, we no longer know what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is called Cervantes’ tradition.
“It is because of his legacy that one is what one tells.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the FIL's invitation with her roundtable on the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican put her own on the great plague of social violence that her country goes through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes of trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "it must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times putting the finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing powers who prefer a world in black and white," he said.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three losses in the finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he was able to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast between them marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three losses in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to reach the decisive series three times, even if so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian ended up comforting himself with the sub-championship medal, he stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Closing 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team made a 2-2 equal match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty streak he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed by 11 meters.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any stats, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important", commented the helmsman when asked what his weak points in the finals would be.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we can't we were already prepared to run before, and I think that's the end.
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time frame, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the fate served us a bad lap, sometimes it's the emotions or the anguish we've got to hold this between us.
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining visas
Individuals must go to Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to report to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (VACs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain benefits for applicants, among which the following are mentioned:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for visa processing and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 in the case of visas with application (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for visas for merchants and investors.
Those who wish to renew their visas will not have to appear for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken from the CSA, applicants who wish to have a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there for less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants to the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. Space Agency has cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will release an astrobiological discovery on Thursday that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA Headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,” which has sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), with the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opposing
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is made possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled when in the Congress appeared an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, which declared itself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tonned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four MPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they do not have it, they will be enslaved again by both parties and in this way will end the opposing coalition.
“So far [the opposition coalition] has arrived, that’s what I’m looking at, because we’re excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipartisanship in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues so that they are more numerous, the Convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that now the Congress has turned into a 'loot' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they don't leave by cupular agreements out to 5 that will probably be 9 MPs, now to the five that see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform that they have made, that they have decided, we are out and we do not agree with this reform."
$200 million more for the "supplier"
The City of Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With it, the amount that was paid this second semester to the owner of the company of electrical equipment amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of supplier account".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the municipality would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, as a result, how many cheques will still be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, October 15, October 19, October 29 and November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Act foresees when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Noroeste had published a review of the checks that the City Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennium of the Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourism sector of Mazatlán has asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be taken care of and new activities must replace others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affected as tourists come to walk around and they see the disorder and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune you lose, elsewhere they didn’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and only do the corrective," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because of the fact that it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need and this type of fact underscores something that is notorious for everyone, the interview is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of Mazatlán’s tourist sites is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put in line together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive to add to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP asks for results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that MPs shoulder the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
The business sector in Mazatlán is calling for a dignified and free legislature to work between the parties and the government executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and facing major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies from PRI, 13 from PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that MPs shoulder the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope that MPs will actually exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to protect their own interests and they turn into a carnival masquerade of governors and leaders of parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask that they certify their commitment to build the necessary bridges that are making progress for the current Governor.
“We will ensure that they do a dignified and above all committed work with society and the sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their confidence vote in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, they generate stimulus for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate job creation.”
Regarding tourism activity, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that this is the second Secretariat of State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generates currency and investment and rivals directly agribusiness."
Apart from the fact that resources need to be classified to detonating tourism projects that help give certainty to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for King Mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is made up of no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they desire so much.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband has no job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plèbes' for sale on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests a year-long suit.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I told him 'we will see, my son', because he was very dear," Cayetana recalls with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, wears size 12; Isaías, 10, wears size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of athletic shoes, so a pair of size five-and-a-half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign We Are Looking for the King Mage, by donating a toy or money at the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The raids took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in locations allegedly used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged heads of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were the result of a long-standing investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Régie de police Memphremagog took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says is expected to solve the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated as the three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
“I stand with a party that created granite under your feet,” Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, as he was surrounded by lawmakers after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the proposed bill, which would detain for up to one year anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill, because he is attacking the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
The NDP’s immigration critic, Olivia Chow, dismissed criticism that her party was not strong enough on illegal immigrants.
“New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that’s what we’re doing through another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it’s targeting refugees and imprisoning children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians are massively telling MPs that they don’t tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a benchmark.”
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led to elections if it was rejected.
A Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that every MP who opposed it would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unity is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea does not date from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this issue as early as January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Stéphane Bergeron, the public safety critic, called the announcement a "bunny out of a hat" and a "bricolated solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over the possible future unity.
“You’ll see the result when we announce it,” he said.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people like you and me think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the École nationale d'administration publique.
To get out of this impasse, he suggests that Québec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
It also believes that Québec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing it to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the cards of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some amendments related to this file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently enacted the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several waterways remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several areas of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two homes were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another slippage would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain was expected by Thursday night, depending on the regions.
Areas north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
Since these precipitations must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in certain sectors, there is a fear of the overflow of several watercourses.
Flood warning warnings were issued Wednesday evening by the Civil Security of Quebec for the rivers Ouareau and the Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, at Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbinière, were the object of flood vigils and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In St. Calixtus, a temporary bridge was swept away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes has led to the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil security remains on alert and is closely monitoring the situation, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Centre de prévision des cruses du Québec issued warnings Wednesday of strong floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec City radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as his coarse language on the air.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some of the remarks contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not suitable for the programs broadcast during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion of suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of two individuals who committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
Moderators should provide solid information rather than misleading information.
With regard to suicide, host Stéphane Dupont had considered that suicide is a gesture of cowardice.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life’s problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'Dupont at noon' have addressed a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame was placed on him.
The latest litigation concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then engaged in a media face-to-face that had aroused a lot of reactions.
The host of CHOI said that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because it was not possible to know for sure that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
“I’ve already served my three-day suspension on that.”
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of gross language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the hours of great listening within three days.
A kung-fu king in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special background.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been living in the city since 2008 to develop his skills among professionals.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights all over the place, because for those who don't like the ground game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and clerk for the UPS company just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he said.
“Currently, I am preparing to go to China for the San Shu World Cup.”
“The fighters who finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category were invited.”
"I won the bronze medal in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“What’s interesting is that I’ve progressed in every competition.”
“At this pace, I’ll be first this time or next year!”
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punching and kicking, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
Duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous boxer from this form of combat is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to remember only one event in his career, he will surely answer his presence in the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," said the sympathetic guy.
"It's kind of the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real pro,” he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in over-the-counter contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it was a consortium formed by the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that obtained the most important, that of the stewardship of the project, for a sum of 295 million dollars without a call for tenders.
This consortium, called Énergie gestion, was formed in 2004 at the same time as Hydro-Québec chose to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Management Consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti québécois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing prices to rise.
“This is the new way to collude and knock out competition.”
“In other words, people, instead of doing it secretly, are now doing it openly,” MEP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he says it is difficult to see how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there was collusion for this contract.
“I’m starting to have my journey,” she said, arguing that the PQ had been “dishonest” and “lack of rigour.”
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is underway and is expected to continue until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; there was negotiation.
Thus, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devoir, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the Quebec business register makes it possible to count more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
Regarding the Energy Management consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay Territory responds to particular labour force dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s."
The big boss of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), gave an explanation that raised eyebrows about the fact that the stewardship contract of the project was granted over-the-counter.
"If you go to tenders and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
“You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say: we’re going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price.”
"But the idea is that it's not the price that matters, it's the competence of the people," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Énergie gestion consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has collected 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They totaled $449,783,344, including the contract to Energy Management of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau dismissed that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance" it, before specifying that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair trade brands and green certifications to guide their choices.
Worse, even if it bathes in a media universe where messages in favor of more responsible consumption abound, it deplores a lack of credible information, a lack that it even describes as a brake on its commitment, indicates the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatoire de la consommation responsable of the Université Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certifications affixed to the so-called fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, the Barometer indicates.
In the same vein, the discourse of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Information on responsible consumption, however, seems essential to stimulate this part of consumption currently driven by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information would calm the ardour of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers also say they are suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that they are trying to get into their hands.
On another note, consumers were nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61%, they also favored purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food products grown in their region, according to the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological conscience still seems to remain outside his car, the Barometer says: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers indicated that they used public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this large behavioral survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus and Parallel Corporation, agrees to collaborate, but only on a loan.
The Angus Development Corporation and the Parallel, who were hoping for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the film complex eXcentris on the boulevard Saint-Laurent by restoring its full cinematic vocation, did not get what they were asking for.
The government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected grant, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be less than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources from the State offices.
A first action plan and a request of $12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris dossier.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet’s counterproposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the state really needs to be ruled out.
Recall that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec was opposed to a direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministère de la Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
On the contrary, a number of stakeholders were calling for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, for ten years carried the author's cinema at arm's length in his premises of the complex after having financed its construction himself, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Treasury Board.
The lack of cinemas for independent films is striking in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
Angus Corporation and Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are conducting a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push for the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has continued to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27 by screening the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled Le Devoir and it is unknown what he and his group think of the downward proposals that are made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables leaked by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the U.S. considers the Canadians’ inferiority complex to the Americans, but they also betray the Canadians’ sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that not every Canadian voter has Canada-U.S. relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government get its budget passed in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp detail than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, either in the middle of the federal election campaign, tells how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the U.S. Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“A near-inherent Canadian inferiority complex may be conditioning Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday domestic issues rather than shift this election to the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, “the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about it.”
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less as the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.”
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Ottawa Chargé d'Affaires, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s survival during the confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, where Canada will show its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30-40 billion stimulus plan,” Breese wrote.
There is no mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramas broadcast on CBC send back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the kidnappings for the CIA's muscle interrogations.
Another cable relates that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed over a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let’s note that the minds are warming regarding the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for the mass leak should be “assassinated.”
Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that is almost one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to have adopted in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluorescent compact bulbs or, better, light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, the bulk of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be replaced.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the global car fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance another 5 Gt to stabilize by 2020 the rise of the climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to avoid that it becomes out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent light bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by two times more.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by manufacturer Philips this week - this company participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about compact fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants costing $2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast nervously awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay,” a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate responsibility and refrain from taking any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission let Wednesday's midnight deadline pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About 40 minutes before the deadline expired, the CIS president said on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The call for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp counts on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former rebel Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters practiced by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo’s complaints are upheld by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any link to the ex-rebels, said the delay in announcing the results was "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had been split in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the lead of the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% including the overseas departments), show the seasonally adjusted data (CVS) provisional published Thursday by the INSEE.
The number of unemployed stands at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% with the DOM.
Over a year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has deteriorated further, with the unemployment rate rising again to 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+0.9 points over three months, +0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the DOM.
In the third quarter, 637,000 youth aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
The elderly experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 points over three months as well as one year), or 482,000 people aged 50 years or more, and 6.6% with the DOM.
Only 25-49-year-olds benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points over three months, +0.1 points over a year) and 8.8% in all of France.
INSEE has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, leader of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône general council, was indicted and found dead at the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the context of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been indicted for misuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, confinement, active corruption, smuggling of influence and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, and not fantasies."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible chefs, it is something else to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP before his client's hearing.
Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, wanted, through his lawyers, to pass the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his close relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted Wednesday night and killed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the use of funds related to their operation, he was never aware of it, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the case.
“My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts that are being accused of.”
"The investigating magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were indicted and released late on Tuesday, with two of them placed under judicial control, said Deputy Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials of the city of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted for "theft and embezzlement of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity in embezzlement of public funds".
Finally, Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was indicted for "receipt of abuse of social property".
Among those confronted by Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently caught up in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of having been used to launder money from the great banditry.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several judicial investigations opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill of La Ciotat, which collects the waste of Aubagne as well as some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: Elysée exaggerated Syria mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", kept the opinion in breath in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice for dealing with their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not had as a counterpart the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the US justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they place in stark light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was not.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage cases".
The Elysee Councillor for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meets with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals detained by force in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “bear in the media the words ‘fundamental human rights,’ ‘innocence,’ ‘immediate liberation.’”
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more because the Iranians are asking you not to do it.”
For, having passed the attempts of discussions through discreet channels, "silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters in dilatory maneuvers".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is “a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230,000 euros of bail).
And he says that the Elysée is anticipating more hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains stranded in Iran.
The Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. demands extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris on the order of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking Iran’s clandestine networks for acquiring equipment for the nuclear program, Majid Khakavand’s enlargement is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee, he said, was not only "completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reverse the decision" judicial, he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of French intelligence services.
The Elysee adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian “is currently located in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy.”
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee does not spare its efforts, through communiqués and organized "leaks" in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation bears fruit since several press articles resonate with the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the media blitz of French officials".
What is the basis of so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then looks at the reasons that prompted the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort “aims to validate Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unmerited".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris seeks to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran”.
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: “Of course, we don’t know if the Syrians did anything.”
“But we thanked them anyway.”
“This should at least sow confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called “Cinderella” law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, to young people under the age of 16, representatives of the ministries of culture and family said.
“A lot of kids play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the ministerial official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who demand it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA designates the host countries
In the midst of turmoil over suspicions of corruption, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday appointed the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk taking precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the queen competition of FIFA will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 one will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who are part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
The backstage negotiations are likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC on Monday released a documentary that pins on three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
It would displease FIFA and embarrass British officials, who have engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the forefront.
The head of the government hopes to re-release the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the 2012 Olympics.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's coat of arms to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the two countries’ bleak economic and financial prospects could undermine their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a major outsider despite the shortcomings in its file (stades, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, appears as the logical favorites.
The world's leading economic power, home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be one step ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the event in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, ardently desired by FIFA, which would effectively render Asian chances for 2022 obsolete.
With Qatar, which launched the big game with futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weak TV rights paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of war for FIFA.
Second Mandate: The Evidence
De Gaulle was hesitant.
Mitterrand had made it appear that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One mandate at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not fit well with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then we have to act as if the doubt always existed.
In one direction as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
That he mentions before UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday night at the Elysée, the prospect of "two terms" has therefore sown a bit of fever.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far from it.
The president only recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he has mentioned the presidential election, in a humorous tone, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he told them in July 2009.
Rebellote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next stage."
His words of the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; they make him no less.
If there are any comments, it is for a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not Ségolène Royal’s entry into the competition that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
This is on the contrary because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are calling for a battle order earlier than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
“We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this,” the Prime Minister’s entourage immediately and cautiously reacted.
"If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," Raffarin said.
"He will always believe he can win," said Alain Juppé, obviously resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to keep buying government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) this year was to be an opportunity to clarify the modalities of exit from the crisis or, at least, to announce the halting of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations that are due to be completed at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis obliges, the Frankfurt issuing institute will probably not be able to afford to be so peremptory or else worsen a situation more than tense today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, praised the active role played by the ECB in resolving the debt crisis of states in Europe.
It declined to say whether it felt the central bank needed to do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...) ".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, showed no more dissent as to his intentions, only indicating that the program to buy government securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting.
The only certainty: the ECB will keep its main central rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have bought for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the anticipation of continued purchases (see page 29).
Neither do economists expect a noticeable change of course.
Although the ECB's over-three-month lending operations have already disappeared from its arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this arrangement to be extended by a few months.
“I can’t imagine she’s significantly changing her schedule.”
“Otherwise, it would be taking the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
- Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds to animate a dull market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a bump in the returns paid by the most fragile states," said a senior bond manager.
Because if interest rates fly away, states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes a round back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a bit yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said they heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "indecipherable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which he later denied.
On Tuesday, in any case, the gap with German long rates had reached a record high of 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy hedge contracts (CDS) had soared to 263 points, leading to some annoyance in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
To be clear, its problem is the lack of growth and the atony of tax revenues that goes with it, making the State run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecast from Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget currently under consideration in the Senate expects 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
“If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken,” said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating this for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short term or in the long term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those requested from other countries," said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
There remains the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would open a period that is not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde once again hammered him yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I think we have demonstrated it again on Sunday in the daytime and at night, are obviously solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although all relative, yesterday's relaxation on European government bond rates has brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet speak of a beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade the rating of Portugal's debt, the target most targeted by speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly on banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas estimate.
“Political time is much slower than market time.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, European countries are stepping up discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
And this also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support the euro area countries in the eye of the markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform far-eastern investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly preparing the ground for them.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
A U.S. official told Reuters yesterday that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries at the forefront, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are keen to avoid asking for international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms that are essential to restoring confidence in the long term.
Finally, European lenders are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardising the sovereign bond markets.
On his way to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had first advanced the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of about 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with, to date, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions were to get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and risk disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienne, have been added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows weakly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snowy episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments have been banned for heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend to take your vehicle only in case of necessity and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were planned Wednesday night to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) on Thursday asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris’ Roissy airport and 10% at Orly because of the upcoming snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions are raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, $23 billion is mentioned for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow on the markets a part of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The amending Finance Act 2010, which was discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, it reads in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is cited: "The proceeds of this tax are 117 million euros per year".
The second is a redevelopment of an office tax that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its output and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that yield?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We are far from the 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of capital allocation that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," the statement read.
In the SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment we create revenues (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after, it is explained."
"It will be entered into the budget and fired as it goes on."
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the promised 4 billion is still for absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat hectic parliamentary discussion.
First public session on 7 December.
Avengers and spies on diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file constituted by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what could have been read in any newspaper for months (except those Berlusconi owns), and Gaddafi's sinisterly caricatured profile has long been for sketch-matter cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should be composed only of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (nor does he know where to look for news about the inexisting), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same goes for the secret files.
The whistleblower is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, what do I know, editor at Liberation), who holds as true only what he recognizes.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since heads of state can telephone or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into espionage centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that any hacker could capture the most secrets of the world’s most powerful country is a major blow to the State Department’s prestige.
Therefore, the scandal does not put the victims as much into crisis as the “bureaus”.
But let us come to the deeper nature of what happened.
In the time of Orwell, one could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had proved completely since, being able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken, and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected as the citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to her.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to post any confidential information - it would be like publishing it on a poster glued to the corner.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to hope to maintain confidential reports over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state travelled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and confidential relations be maintained in the future?
I know well that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore novelistic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents moving discreetly in diligences to uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a heel.
The information will be kept as a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has restored a wired (telephone) telegraph.
Videotapes (analog) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now CDs (digital) only allow jumping from chapter to chapter, that is, in macro-portions.
With high-speed trains, you get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the commutes that it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the politics and communications techniques come back to horse-drawn cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the secret embassies.
Now it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: How France Bribes Its Promises of Financing
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the promises of fast-start or early-start financing made by developed countries.
And the big French masterminds are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion over three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU launched the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, big side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and valued: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at it in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being to the detriment of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a benchmark: international funding is maintained, and it adds <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million over three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France considers that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to spending in previous years or at the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
Concretely, the total amount of support from France to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment in terms of "new and additional" financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their calculation method.
Some, like France, consider that 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> lent is equivalent to 1 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> given.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that rely on more efficient technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to one euro that is given ... At most, it should be counted under its commitments only the cost of the loan for the lending country.
But France has nothing to do with such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts in <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to meet its commitment, France puts in only 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Nice pass trick!
In summary, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, it manages to make it seem that it is spending <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy made the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to all the climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machine that is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance the discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
So hope rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (ex-Movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have significant statistical value in the light of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem addressed", bought between July and September the foods usually consumed in four meals and a snack in a day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as treats, were reviewed by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that can act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, our investigation clearly shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven to be carcinogenic, as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemicals including a fungicide yet banned in France.
The same goes for Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even breadstick and chewing gum were filled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the richest with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this “contaminant cocktail” “is probably underestimated,” according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-The Greens (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
