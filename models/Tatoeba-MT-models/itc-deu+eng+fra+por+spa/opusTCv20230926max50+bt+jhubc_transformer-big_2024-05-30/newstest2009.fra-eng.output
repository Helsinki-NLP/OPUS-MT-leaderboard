At the end of the trades, the Prague stock exchange fell into the negative
After Tuesday morning’s crash, the Prague stock exchange rectified its losses.
Trades with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trades.
On Tuesday, at the start of trading, the Prague stock exchange resumed its fall the day before, when it was losing almost six percent.
This time, the fall is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
The market reaction to the result of the vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the stabilization plan for the U.S. financial sector, is thus also noticeable among us.
Falling shares in Asia
Asian stocks fell sharply on Tuesday, even though the indexes succeeded in clearing some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost four percent during trading, but later wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following the Chinese stock movement of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent as markets closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange were losing more than five percent, but eventually we managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"Hesitation about the U.S. bailout will affect financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk that other countries would be affected.
The bloodbath of U.S. stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the proposed financial system support, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (almost K<0xC4><0x8D> 12 trillion).
Legislators thus deny the call for support for President George Bush’s project.
According to Bush, the project should address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday suffered a bloodbath and major stock indices experienced their biggest drop in 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a drop of such magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress Gives Up: U.S. Government Can Inject $700 Billion Into Banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial aid to the US financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers took a decisive turn in talks on the adoption of a bailout in the form of $700 billion in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
However, success is not certain.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and put it to a vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, the chairman of the House banking and financial regulation committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, by Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to a vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout will be adopted should be a major first psychological factor to revive financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market aid can be effective, a "disillusionment" will follow.
Paulson: The plan needs to be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have resolved our divergent views on the form that the package of measures for market stabilization should take," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to her, the final vote could be held as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, lawmakers met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, in order to give the bottom of the government a final form.
The latter should buy back from financial corporations the unsold real estate assets that cause financial firms to lose considerable amounts and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to pursue this market recovery plan, but I think we are there," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on falling equity markets.
Democrat Senator Harry Reid says lawmakers are pushing for a final deal in Congress as early as Sunday.
They want to calm investors ahead of the start of trading in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the Congressional decision could influence Monday’s trading.
For the time being, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two Houses of Congress will vote, or whether the negotiations will remain blocked at the last moment by this or that problem.
Legislators hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount allocated to the system should be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be made available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the possibility of blocking the granting of the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed the progress in the negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress has the option of putting it in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
“All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Sen. Judd Gregg.
U.S. President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chair Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says lawmakers have agreed on accountability for the financial program, protection of taxpayers from losses, the relief agreement, the time-line plan.
The new law also provides for the limitation of such golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and it establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides aid for homeowners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new down payments in the case of mortgages it will buy back, while reducing debtors' monthly payments and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that it is not known what the mechanism and price of the purchase of the problem assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is not, according to Marek, so important.
“It’s much more important that the congressmen agree, this week, that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," Marek said.
A fight pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobile phones can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house an expensive high-end gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are stacked vinyl records in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you at least probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same goes for music on the go, i.e. compressed music, to put it simply - MP3 music.
Here too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, in the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would have a hard time supporting headphones bought for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also crucial.
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are functions unknown, of course, to most mobile phones.
No device today is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calls and sending SMS, it is able to play music and movies, record them, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take into account smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Given that no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are virtually witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The more functions you use, the shorter the interval between two reloads.
And playing music is one of the most important inflows of energy.
There are few mobile phones that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobiles, expect that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get yourself, to be sure, a second charger for work - this is valid even for more expensive devices.
This problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, as a result of a recharge, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing ones.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
It is obviously possible to record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobiles.
When it comes to drives, you don't need, except for the iPod, any software.
Simply fill in the music device from the computer via the USB connector.
Most mobiles and readers will create a media library themselves, categorized according to the performer's name, the album title, the style, or the user's judgment.
Some devices display only one index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a specific device, pay particular attention to the life of the battery, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen to it that for a limited time, for example taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3.
Virtually all mobile phones are capable of this today.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to play.
Everyone can play MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also manage to play music in WMA format.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods), on the other hand, is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit the corresponding operator’s (or another provider’s) web pages from your mobile phone and purchase the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a musical motive.
The supply of operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, to radio tubes quickly made.
The prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile phones on themselves.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just have to take the mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have earphones or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which practically all mobiles have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three or four thousand crowns, you can have an already very suitable walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped, also equipped with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy control.
Really anyone manages to command the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest ones (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the control to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an exchangeable memory card slot (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models in principle only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive get away with even 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the ease of the control is similar to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobile phones have the same user menu as separately sold MP3 players, is the one that has gone the farthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a longer battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
- Maybe.
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the European Commission' s final steps in the field of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there is no room for another operator, made a chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network is apparently no longer very lucky (in fact, now it would hardly find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable drop in prices, to which conventional operators had to subsequently react.
Yet, even before the arrival of troublemakers such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those we hear today were heard in Great Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could be a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to win more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in Czechia, among others.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be efficient, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
This is how in the world, virtual operators look like low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity move.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
“True men choose Mobilking — an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating the virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work also at home.
Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera Group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of enterprise customers, has not hidden, for long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already negotiated this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to make progress in the negotiations," said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
The future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
“Right now, we do not believe there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with others very specific.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of Telefonika O2's press department in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová said in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet recorded a viable and bilaterally advantageous project that could serve as a basis."
“It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time, we should have a concrete agreement now."
Instead, Vodafone is focusing on fulfilling requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of shared fees and infrastructure.
This is what we believe means the most contributions from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in line with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore a decrease in their profit.
What is the point of facilitating the emergence of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to understand themselves as thieves in fairs. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The biggest apparent pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, at the time of the creation of the U:fon, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s web pages.
Nowadays, the U:fon lends itself as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: “Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the market entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at this time, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not a priori presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS Department of External Relations in response to our question.
Such a statement would not be surprising on the part of representatives of operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one profits from its position in the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Especially as Kristián Chalupa adds: "Overseas, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a drop in the prices of mobile phone services."
However, pressure for an honest functioning of the market and a fall in prices is apparently not in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if it is really a coincidence, naturally arises.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all gas stations is probably due to chance and the hard fight of the competition.
"The Office has not identified any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and consequently none has an increased corresponding responsibility for its behaviour in the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably lacking even the telecoms regulator," Chaloupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant market position is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator logically has a monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are visibly proceeding in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Putting the responsibility back on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in communications, by means of which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes its hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the novelization of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, an expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications was not achieved, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
This the representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know very well, but their interests seem to lie elsewhere.
When no one's watching, it can work
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone price lists, but these are only partly public.
In most cases, it is about companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Customized mobile phone services are offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually only reach elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company does in front of the operator figure of a classic business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major customer, she gets special (and other) price offers.
What is problematic is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a resale.
"If what you are talking about were to happen, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions that we would be looking at and that could result in an end to the collaboration with the company in question," Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has not reached the heads of the mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, speaks out against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible benefits, and, at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But that is precisely what should seem strange to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another question arises at <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators sometimes tried more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, if not too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies have intervened in the developed countries, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they ended up with the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators treat this issue like a hot potato that you get rid of by passing it on to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But don't throw the sleeve after the blow.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear with us, the Czech mobile market may be back on track.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will hardly be able to remain impassive in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo singing, a choral interpretation and an instrumental version.
The singing was performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremia<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek are the authors of the anthem arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of the solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to make sure that both singers, as well as the choir, have a good diction, so that we understand the lyrics, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j was first played in 1834 on the plates of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka (Kermesse of the Sweaters), a Czech original piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip in their ticketing system on Wednesday
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravní podnik (Prague Transport Agency) will be recorded as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pockets.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a coupon for 30 days or 90 days (this one will be valid from January 1, 2009) and both have it registered on their smart card in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>rovstek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í Hole<0xC5><0xBE>í, Role<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy coupons online on the web pages of Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who start using the online store can permanently forget about the ticket offices in the subway stations, where they have hitherto had to impatiently trample in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon online and it will be registered on their Opencard in one of the thirteen M<0xC4><0x9B>stská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these points of contact, there is a ticket desk with trained staff, who will help the interested parties with the purchase via the internet and, in addition, will register the coupon they bought on their card," says project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Alongside libraries, it will also be possible to register electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the lobby of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recall the composting machines the tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
An ATM will control the coupon instead of the driver
The automatons that will operate from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
Namely in the peri-urban trains and the bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of the central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In integrated trains in Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ská integrovaná doprava (Prague Integrated Transport), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons," explained the ticket control Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of public transport prague.
The peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s checkout.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard in the place indicated on the side of the checkout.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the vouchers registered, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which the validity of their coupon expires, can rejoin the vending machines, initially used to register the coupons on the card.
It is here, on the screen of the device, that the information regarding the validity of their document will be displayed.
Sudetenland demands a referendum in the United States
The Sudeten Germans demanded in 1945 that <0xC5><0xA0>umava be integrated into the United States.
This stems from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knihovna (South Bohemian Scientific Library).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This stems, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knihovna.
Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov begged the American president in the letter not to allow "<0xC5><0xA1>umavská <0xC5><0xBE>upa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter, signed "People, whom the fate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava is at heart," reads.
Given that the rally in Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, inconsiderate attitude, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take in his hands the protectorate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state alien to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants," the letter reads.
The alleged reason the authors cannot sign the letter is fear of the desire for revenge of the “Czech oppressors”.
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, he would have only to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Germans of the Sudetenland of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to foresee that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to gain some sort of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein region capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would be profitable to them," Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>ebí<0xC4><0x8D>ek believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, movies, the Internet, and leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It wants above all to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also evidenced by the slogan "bloody" of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a pool of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
This must symbolize that one can pay with one’s life a moment of inattention.
The spots will haunt spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where we can commonly see images with drastic images of the victims of the accidents.
It believes that this will lead to a reduction in the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The sugar and whip strategy against drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Risks must be reminded to drivers," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
Signs signaling the danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static hazard warning panel is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers won't notice it anymore," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án said.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli Provisional Government, spoke in favor of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert said.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be made," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he later pointed out.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also supported Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was a prerequisite for a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
“I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan,” he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda (terrorist network), as well as that of the Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance bus is forbidden
In the context of the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move inside the bus during the journey.
"If the law is to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck who crossed paths with the coach.
The girl was unfortunately seated next to the driver in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus can have an accident or even brake abruptly, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is under its data sheet equipped with standing or not seats.
If this seating equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The Student Agency long-distance coaches do not have standing seats; this was confirmed in Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
“This is an issue that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got passengers to go to the toilet on the way as long as they have their own seats," he said.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no unequivocal legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The road transport law knows only the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," added spokesperson Hanzelka more ambiguously.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the director of the Department of Road Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law deals sufficiently with the issue.
"It all depends on whether the coach has in its approval the permission to propose standing seats.
It's all in there," he said.
The coaches are divided into urban, where there are standing seats and a limited maximum speed, long distance coaches with standing seats and a higher permitted speed and long distance coaches without standing seats with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Just like on a plane, an expert says.
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín, an expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) on transport safety, does not see the displacement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Neither is it certain when turbulence will occur and the flight attendant may hit her head.”
In the event that the bus braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
Same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by internal prescriptions," he said, adding that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer the services of stewards.
He hired two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their occupation to be a hazardous occupation.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I have the impression that it is a risky trade, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
It would also reduce costs," he said.
The safety concern is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of the Asian Alexei Litvine, which ensures, compared to SA, a very small number of lines.
"We have no hostesses, we have opposed them from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz a year ago.
A huge tragedy has happened
A young hostess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a blinker and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter trying to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he neared it by his right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the family of the girl, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but with regard to the financial compensation, it also counts on the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been in the works for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transportation, could clarify the trips of the stewards on board the coach.
"Now, it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99>ín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally jeopardize the safety of passengers," said spokesman Hanzelka, adding that the control of the safety of coaches is under the control of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
There was no shortage of words in the letter from the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
Through a merger of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial market institution of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could be constituted, according to the letter made public on Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "block of competence" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive start to other concentrations in the banking sector in the Länder.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is still under heavy pressure.
It was not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that, only recently, made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
For some time now, however, there has been talk - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some kind between the bank Deka, which knows the clients of the Sparkasse by their investment funds, and the WestLB.
Certainly the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas made known during the presentation of the figures of the semester at the end of August that he saw no meaning in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, whether it be the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and by the groupings of savings banks, has instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with the WestLB with a view to joint commercial activities.
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks, however, have only just begun, it is said in the financial square.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial centre, has come into play when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a time that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Rhineland Palatinate and Halbab.
Yet nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
As soon as the plans had been made public, the government of the Land of Hesse ruled against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Later, the other two houses did not join either.
The Bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate has been attached instead to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the regrouping of the Deka-Bank with the banks of the Länder.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the board of Hellaba, had spoken out against any merger business strategy with his bank.
Notwithstanding this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the grouping of the different institutions of the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the Bavarian state parliamentary election has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Baden-Württemberg state bank could come to fruition in the first place.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for new mergers were to increase, the potential partners would gradually escape it.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far withstood the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringen Savings and Transfers Group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, locked in any union with the WestLB at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB would remain strict.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of which business model the future capacity of the Länder banks should be secured had not so far been resolved by the German grouping of savings and transfer funds.
In the long run, a shredding of the WestLb could take place, a shredding which is obviously not desired here.
This is also what is mentioned in the letter of the steering committee in place: in any case, a "global solution" for the establishment would be aimed at.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the weekend of the Italians.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, near a five-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 beer festival visitors what deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna they came all the way to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nueva station, four buses take the departure tonight at 23:45, <0x60>destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel Brazilians exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And as noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it’s not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with faux fur and glasses with large silver frames.
For the past five years, they have been going to the beer festival, already three trips this year alone.
They go there at night, spend the day at the party, and come home at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian law of purity, health insurance and a head of the German-speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses drive at night on the Autostrada direction <0x60>Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better yet, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Brixen, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates are once again making a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, wear the yellow cap.
On the left is written <0x60>Beer Festival', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency <0x60>conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Secondly: ‘When the doors of the beer tent open, we run,’ shouts Marco in the early morning.
<0x60>Run!' Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
<0x60>Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we must distribute them in the room!'
The cup, cries Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the deposit!
<0x60>Show the security guards that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!"
Thirdly: ‘Tonight, being back here at ten and a half hours!’ Understood?
And that's it, it's off to the beer party.
Along the way, someone ties yellow hats to trees to find the way, signs and even an election poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the <0x60>weekend of the Italians'.
There are no precise figures; there are talk of 50,000 who are on their way through the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, 10 percent of the visitors would have come on purpose from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross which performs a statistic on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with almost 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the brewery Hofbräu.
Nights of insomnia for shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted just a few weeks ago.
How fortunate that the politician used the word ‘relatively’ and that he slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This indeed happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, is getting a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are being issued up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes as much from private banks as from publicly owned banks.
In the background, it is the daughter company Depfa that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which has not been possible since because of mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 per cent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.37 million, while the equity rate had also decreased slightly by 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Ongoing and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero compared with the same period last year, profits from the allocation of receivables and determined securities and the termination of provisions in credit operations fell by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And it is only thanks to the significant profits from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the Konzern companies that the gains deficit of about 16 percent was found to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated poorly on industrial real estate loans, which had then been subsidized to the bank Aareal.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa then became more intensively involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the state (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter company, the Hypo Real Estate must make amortizations that should have on the calculation of the gains and losses of the group an essential material effect that still remains rather vague.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had already been truncated to two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure investor since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the inter-bank market as it has no client deposits.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has once again dried up considerably, as banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs part of the total loans of the Depfa for a short-term refinancing facility each year – about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing need is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of business at present.
Other sources say the refinancing would be secured through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to the medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Establishment (Bafin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Group is now assured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank have only to hope for this.
However, given the dynamics and impossibility of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still at the gates of insolvency Sunday evening, this bailout at least provisional will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The share price collapsed 75 percent to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.30.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While debts in the first place have barely moved, the prices of secondary loans are declining.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former daughter company Württemberg Hypo and of course those that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of the Hypo Real Estate bank seemed to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the same institute that brought the crisis into the institution by the purchase of the bank Depfa.
As long as issuing institutions, governments and less-affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, a resorption of arrears can be assumed over time.
Or what no one dares to hope for right now – that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed rumors of partial nationalization, the likelihood that was approaching certainty has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should reserve nights of insomnia above all to long-term creditors on the decision whether they should part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn on to carry forward losses for the next few years on the next capital income tax of automatically drawn stock gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to show up for her first day at Tachibana Highschool, the girls start laughing: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean? I don't know.
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new exchange log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What I was excited about.
Already the way to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to the Highschool of Tachibana.
I had to find my way on my own, thankfully I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be set as strictly as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a round of the table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I did not have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I stood in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all did low masses, puffed up with laughter and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii."
I knew him from my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teens and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to the best, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all took out their bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something else than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look weird and taste completely new.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
All right, except maybe the candied salted plums, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read this in my mangas.
I’m curious if I can see it here too.
“Why Japan in particular?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading manga is what I’ve been preferring for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture there, at one point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats have feelings too.
A rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean it also feels fear?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves in the same way as us?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in that case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and approach the questions of feeling or in general of consciousness, we enter into hard-to-reach terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees, or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At the very least, then, for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the awareness of who we are, and the ability to foresee and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity might lie in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence being linked to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses us great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more readily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happened in studies of primate short-term memory, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: the two can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of the visualization.
But what does this mean for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its aftermath, such as the reactions of the body) takes over from the vivid memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, arise, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities arise in the body sensation regions of the cortex and brainstem, just as Jaak Pankseep does, however, focus more on the brainstem.
As this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could quite participate in cross-sectional sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe this is indemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in men and rats is likely to be felt as fear in both cases: how, however, could one check whether rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but what if it feels afraid?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Certainly, the nervous comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain stems, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem causing sensations?
And even if we could prove it for humans, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are likely to differ completely from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is made on the nervous plane to the extent that the same thing is measured in rats and in humans.
As I do not explore the language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist.
We could judge this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly bump myself against a wall.
I am a pragmatic emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We have to work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian League President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA is constantly watching us.
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in accordance with the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured the UEFA President in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division league were convicted in the previous season of compulsory relegation manipulation; in the end, the start of the league had to be delayed until the last minute.
Dennis Quaid outraged counterattack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her private life in an interview — and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her former adulterer Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counterattacks.
A Late Rose War for ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - seen and known by everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage’s failure: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
She would have learned of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it is told the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his call as an unfaithful husband fell clearly: it would be “Monstrous,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, “that Meg once again forgets the story of our relationship and manipulates it.”
It would be even more "regrettable" that "the pain and upheaval of divorce for every child is revived in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his response to the clawstroke: "In any case, my life goes on.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that is doing its best.”
Prices of air tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
The flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after a rise in prices in the first quarter, a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After prices in the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already decreased in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by a further 6.9 percent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was especially sharp in Paris and Rome, where travellers were due to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low price of the dollar which has led to a "decreasing travel enthusiasm of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand with a rise of 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was up in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, passengers in economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, very fuel-intensive, even increased up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, business class and first class however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights have even been halved according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be on the one hand a weakening economic growth, the company explains.
Demand would give way in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the elimination by airlines of unprofitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that reportedly filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV defeats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, SV Hamburg became first in the standings.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player only returned late in the game and his shot lifted failed against the frame of the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, it had come out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled in the locker room of the Hamburg Arena.
There wasn’t much going on in the locker rooms, the halftime was over and most of them had settled down in their place.
Rieger was for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
Implementation has been lacking.
“Not everything was very beautiful to see today,” later admitted Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard "would also have liked to be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 in the half-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful headstroke by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
“It was a bad win,” Marin Jol summed up.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121th anniversary this Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, the fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional leaderboards on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to take a step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the first League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as debauched Jansen of FC Bayern - is indeed forming slowly, but it is not yet shining.
“We need more charm and more dribbling,” Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, there is fear.
The first news of the failure of the bailout dropped the Dow Jones temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in one day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones recovered a bit.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock index was 10,579 points, with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq technology market index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The biggest losers in the Dow Jones were American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America, which lost about 12 percent.
No title could bring any more profits.
The shares of Goldman Sachs Bank fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffet had partnered with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid in one go, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial corporation that may be traded in correlation with price developments in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
Stock prices sucked into the vortex in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States are not addressing the concerns of investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The US Dow Jones index collapses despite the state's planned bailout of the financial market.
Dramatic falls in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The shares of the Bavarian real estate financier lost three-quarters of their value despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank reported a fall of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped sharply below the high psychological bar of 6,000 points and was trading at 5,839 points with a 3.7 percent deficit.
Around the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared the U.S. government’s heavy $700 billion bailout might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate is expected to follow October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also saw only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index fell by 3.2 percent at the moment, while the CAC 40 in Paris fell by 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after rising from 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng Index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism multinational also said the shares would not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers puzzled: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts worry that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to soon frozen fuel pipelines, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, Earth for example.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what has surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
There are also irregularities in speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the gravitational support anomaly.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still believes that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, matter that is also close to Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, particularly no visible light.
According to the scientists’ calculations, dark matter would still account for a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-release shooting, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are constantly in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was reported jointly by Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are in the process of checking their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and safe, announced the Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages' release remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the abduction, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the officer said.
All that remained was to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday shot dead six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be handed over by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom payment.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the story.
Abuse of a father-in-law "which led to suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse inflicted by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent conduct.
The Truro High Court ruled that he regularly tied up his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, as a child between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: “I feel responsible for his death.”
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied and bandaged her before forcing her to perform sexual acts while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law left for Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a regular volunteer at the National Trust, was haunted by the abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, that since 2006 she appeared “emotionally dead,” and “had lost all hope for life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the father-in-law of his daughter, who had also written a letter of confession that ended as follows: "I tied her up and bandaged her regularly".
“I didn’t abuse her sexually.
“I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You’re really weird as a fetishist, your victim certainly should have been terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
“This unpleasant saga ended with the victim’s suicide.
And what’s even more amazing is the fact that if she hadn’t done that gesture, her story would certainly never have ended in court.”
He added: "I emphasize in particular, as described by his father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would no doubt be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who forgot top-secret documents in June on a train will be sentenced by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC reported.
The Ministry of Defence man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of people from Whitehall.
"They may have thought that this case would have remained within the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, that is to say the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the tutelage of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee of the Secret Services.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda as well as the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies against the B&B bill.
British construction companies may have to pay an invoice of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million, to cover the bailout of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) Managing Director Adrian Coles said it is “irritating” to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken pots...
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will increase at the same time, will be charged, every year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC, that the 59 construction companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have been cautious... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay the first year’s interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the commercial committee of the construction companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is “irritating” to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously during the recovery of the real estate market now have to pay for much less cautious institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
“We need to look at all aspects of this case over the coming weeks, to assess options to be taken to prevent construction companies and their members from paying this salty bill,” Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, full-year interest will have to be paid, which could double.
Since construction companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases by up to five pence per liter
The people of Jersey must pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, by five pence per liter, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase following a two-penny increase in February, following a search by a consulting firm.
Retailers have to decide if they will in turn, increase the price to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had been varied for the last time, in 2002.
Former Bangladeshi PM denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a request for bail from former PM Sheikh Hasina, who risks being arrested when he returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to bail her because of her indictment for extorting from a businessman 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many charges brought against him.
Khaleda Zia, the longtime rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country's interim military government first give him full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free on her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s request saying it does not require bail as she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former leader of the Awami party said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June for treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Zhaleda Zia deny the allegations.
Concerns about the Afghan polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
Last week, the UN carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she said she was unable to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
A UN spokesperson said this happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB Loses ITV Judicial Battle
BSkyB lost its case following the Competition Commission's verdict, which would require it to reduce its stake in its rival transmitter ITV.
The Court of Appeal for Competition ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to effectively prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that BSkyB's purchase of ITV's shares raised doubts about ITV's actual independence, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate the
Virgin boss Richard Branson, a consumer group and regulator Ofcom were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB responded that forcing it to reduce its shares of ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just given up its voting rights.
A new investigation into the U.S. prosecutor's case.
The attorney general appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole thing arose from the account of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Accuser Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officers interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators, obstructing justice.
“Serious, potentially criminal conduct charges, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the December 2006 dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department said prosecutors were fired because of poor performance.
But it later emerged that dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to attribute these dismissals to a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others reportedly refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting prosecutions for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of Department of Justice officials have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these layoffs, and ended up "abdicating" his leadership role, "remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush aide Karl Rove, have been critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic will have to be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was “honored” to get this recognition.
The nine-minute-and-fifty-second song was the title track on Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The awards evening is presented by Coldplay, with this year’s selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly is one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, ranking 15th.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained on the English charts for nine years, and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, by his real name- has suffered from a health problem in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure his irregular heartbeat, after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a severe laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in his vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Soon Be For Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents don't know how to give directions to get to Extra Place, as they have never heard of it.
The street lies in East Village and runs north of First Street—not to be confused with Second Street—between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide by 120 long, it resembles a dusty driveway rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to feed Extra Place, and create a more seamless passage to the stores and boutiques, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood landlord committees, representatives from the city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal authorizing the building builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
“They could offer to rehabilitate it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to feed the small street and install seats, some of which would be used by a café to which the builder would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, that doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main interest is to re-make this abandoned driveway, and make it public,” she said, noting that it was the city that suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing further that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place bears this name since 1802, when the inheritance of Philip Minthorne's many children's large farm was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The back entrance to the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, has reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of the Ramones album Rocket to Russia.
“This place was beautiful,” said Danny Fields, the Ramones’ manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scrap metal, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had previously talked about the East Village’s evolution to luxury, objected to the idea of selling Extra Place, saying this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity--a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be put away in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Disputes: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac, dark by day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and shutters, full of newspapers from the past week flying along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs agile at the bottom of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the headquarters of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer, sits next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passers-by said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Field, on the other hand, said he believed some subordinates felt the appeal of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “have taken place in dark, wet, and disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California studies fellow and former director of the education department at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Thought. Why Middle Classes Must Be Able to Choose Their School."
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Obama’s campaign points out that “Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program supports, among many other topics, "bilingual transitional education" for those learning English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends classroom instruction in languages other than English, goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The majority of the students at this school are Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of students, consisting of many newcomers, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 state maths exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-language-arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than the one proposed by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, a constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, principal of Sixth Street, this school has established the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
Total immersion in the English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Ms. Mikels, opposed to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would not have had any chance to identify him."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us."
Shouldn’t Obama take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools that are mostly Hispanic students learning English?
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
Although he is in favour of the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently regarded this issue as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop polemicizing on the wording of laws in the English language.
"On the contrary," he said, "you have to make sure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should look carefully at the models of education that work, rather than scorn them or view them as insignificant.
Net Oil Fall as a result of the New Concerns of the World of Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people fear that the bailout for the financial markets will bring the economy back to life.
Crude oil futures trades fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel. The New York Mercantile Exchange, during sales this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street financial turmoil, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in the face of deep uncertainties in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were again worried despite the agreement on the bailout, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by congressional leaders.
The news was alleviated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial catastrophe, Citygroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said this weekend’s frantic negotiations, concluded with the bailout agreement, “seem to have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
"The prospects for global equity, interest rates and exchange markets have become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“When it comes to raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally and particularly in China.”
Analysts at the bank lowered their expectations for next year, given the drops in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, so they were forced to lower the forecast for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20 percent.
The Feast of the Second Determinant Time for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he’d seen it all.
He watched the second half, when the Jets turned a 0-0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played heavily in the dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor to an afternoon during which their relationship took a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when one corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from halftime.
"I didn't get out of my area," Favre said of all his passes at Coles.
“He’s a mediocre player.”
“We were communicating extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were wrestling, the defense defeated Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a missed shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted her.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball slip because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, might well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of that possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets retrieved the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal by taking a 34-0 lead.
It was the best the Jets could have scored in a while.
"Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said, 'Second half or third half?'
When told the two--the Jets dropped 21 points in the third half--Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpassing his world record.
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again proved worthy of his title as the century’s best cross-country runner, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 from an accommodating race on the flat, Gebrselassie broke by 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, played last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record for his superb career in which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, the 1600m of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps exaggeratedly in today's eyes - that air pollution might increase her asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees out, 55 in the finish- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into cross-country runners, have contributed to the decrease of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, he suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain shiny, but not rusty.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I went back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went well.
He has been blamed - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's African rival - for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, relying on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie's abilities as a cross-country runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. halfway.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
A little over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final comeback to detach from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone to win the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving on her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a clever strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a nice lead, then overtaking them about 18 miles and a half later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City Apart, Pride and the Trials of Dark Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first all-black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make nowadays." The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison."
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival held every year in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in a variety of ways, the city she describes- has become touristy thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tour guide published by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston recounted that the rural black population of Florida was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knows us so little, doesn't know what he's losing."
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious of the foreign eye.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59, a long-time resident and the city's oldest parishioner.
"It has to be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of black power takeover and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture - sometimes disdained, sometimes acclaimed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through sincere, dialect-filled books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a road that runs through often-forgotten central Florida, ending in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Bold as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was later divided into several private parts.
“After crossing the road on the left,” she writes, “you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he can barely read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used by people passing by.
So, in barely a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn’t really a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortalized, quoting the colorless songs performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who frequently returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in the city without warning, aboard a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many made fun of her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he adds further, swinging in his chair from the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in any grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy she offered to the world,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Officials in Orange County wanted a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's two-lane main street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race-mixing dispute drove hatred to the gates of the community.
“At that time, a bunch of young white people were throwing oranges or objects at people sitting on the side,” Franklin said.
"A lady has even died."
They threw a watermelon out of their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education as “insulting rather than glorifying my race.”
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember well - our master was kissed in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Eatonville Community Safeguard, a nonprofit group.
It lasted, she added, until the time when teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white teacher because he’s white – I mean there’s a cultural demarcation line here,” Nathiri said.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston--black writers, actors, and artists who have gone beyond prejudice, such as her, armed with joyful self-confidence and guidelines such as, "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston’s anonymous grave and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, reintroduced it to the American canons.
The highway project came just as Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of the highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival’s opening two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposal of the highway.
"The fiasco of the five-lane motorway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summed it up by stating that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents were beginning to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a historic city since 1998.
A monothematic library (renamed Hurston) opened in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, rebuilt.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, there are 90 percent of blacks.)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
Permission must be sought for most interviews, and certain things--such as the walls of the old church in Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields--should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weakness for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride emerged.
Young people in particular tend to regard Eatonville as Hurston regarded his entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bossy, mad and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
The voice of Franklin's 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, is genuine civic affection, and he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police forces, who need extra strength.
And even the youngest, like 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have correctly learned the description of Eatonville.
"Most people who pass through this area will think, 'Oh, this city hasn't compared to anything else,'" Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone speaks fluently about finance.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they’re in the eye of the cyclone.
Never could they think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst “work day at the office” since the 1929 crack.
Deliverers continue to sneak on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
Latinos still linger among residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke arranged on their shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to go and open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work at the end of the afternoon, as I was discovering at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people standing in line.
Not in front of the cashier's desks, or to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service desk, where regular customers ordered their checkbooks, tourists asked for directions for Macy's store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my “authorized personal banker,” were all queuing for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, as they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit unions, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and say they treat customers like their families.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $327, has resorted to the bankruptcy trustee, and as New Yorkers returned home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings of $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and the store employees in front of me, frightened of another potential debacle, transferred their money to a bank that seems to them reliable, the one that does the most bailout on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I was hearing a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone about Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its meager CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had in criticizing a colleague.
And Lyn, my building's uniform janitor, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries from my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money fund market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take risks.”
Muslim tombs desecrated while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who has abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating mosques striped in red.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to police, an organized action.
The offenders painted on several tombs Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, detectives believe this could have been done to disguise extremists' hatred of Muslim immigrants.
This incident could somehow be related to the election.
A spokesperson for the local Islamic community said she was “deeply shocked” at the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that is coming to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking about regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that garnered nearly 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, ran an anti-immigration campaign, some of whose slogans were even considered, according to critics, xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, led his campaign against the wearing of headscarves and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
The two parties tried to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter banned from traveling abroad.
The courts have banned the glamorous rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he had expressed to the authorities under his control his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent issued a travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter’s guilt for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford court hearing, but was represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson said: "Thursday, September 25 at the Ashford courthouse, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until March 25.
“Paul Gadd wasn’t there then.”
Glitter, 64, informed authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if he was to be registered on the sexual abuse accused list.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years imprisonment.
Kent police said they would not discuss Glitter’s particular cases or potential travel in the county.
A spokesperson for the Kent Police said: “The Kent Police will do whatever it takes to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"In our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices that are able to manage any potential risks, much more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the dearest intention of the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from controlling passports, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities denied him entry into their territory, and he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the court of limited jurisdiction in Uxbridge, West London, to register him on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from travel in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off-stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments unknown to the general public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen looks of artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, which gets bigger every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... captivating the public.
To capture moments of the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and character of their own.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera moments of the personality of flamenco stars.”
In 1997, Bauer began a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, recall classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dance or singing per se, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essential and magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are among the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has turned into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book of collection of portraits exhibited in the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people, getting to know them and being able to enter their lives for a more or less long moment.
I believe that in photography portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you do not know or that leave you only a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I still try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 rue de la Mata (parallel street to the Hercules People's Square) which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true audacity"
The novel takes place in places no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he is working, a novel that has as main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who has passed through the Amazon.
The winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies him "is a true audacity" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I would not do it, but I will do it and hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw parade in the city of the aqueduct a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of the participants’ voices, made a full room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself facing a fascinated audience that did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote of his rething to a very "man".
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books are life-changing. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure fun, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less similar" to vocabulary, because the writers were asked to "not want to" themselves.
Bad weather ruins the Pozoblanco fair
The flag festival that concluded the bullfights at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after horseback riders checked that the arena was impassable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The bad weather has taken a toll on this fair, since in the end two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bullfight.
José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista should have clashed in the arena of Castilblanco.
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was worn in triumph, after making arm movements facing the bull with taste and aesthetics.
That very afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the uncovered stands applauded more than his fight in itself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrested two occupants of a van and the latter two undertook the flight.
Its loading, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
Police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., according to information leaked by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Traffic Unit of Alava were carrying out a control of the vehicles on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the side, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hash bales and then transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials found that the license plate had been "forged" since it did not coincide with the one written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they blamed the detainee for a crime of falsification of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28, was detained to perform the various procedures and will be tried within hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesman for the California police patrol revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that at around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "full pressed the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back several times, she drove on her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop in the middle of the highway and exit her vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "he was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
“She looked disoriented,” that’s why officers took her to the drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the start, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought that Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 7.00 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear walked out of the Arizona clinic where she was hospitalized to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing favourable treatments to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the behavior of the political party that he will have to adopt in the Seville city council.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations be "transparent" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this type of case so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has “very strict ethical codes for all officials.”
" Sangre de Mayo ", Garci's daring bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Blood of Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film, "Blood of Mayo," will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a more than four-hour TV series for Telemadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garci claims to have realized with this filming "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2 in Madrid, something he always accepted when the story was based on national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Commune of Madrid constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decor and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that was mistaken as leader for the fight, since, the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Blood of Mayo" - because he was not able to shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he is used to rehearse before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, since it seems "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and the cinema to keep informed".
Many actors in "Blood of Mayo" rehearse in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three nominees that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Blood of May", "Seven French Billiards" and finally the winner, "Blind Sunflowers", are not representative of young Spanish cinema, "which deserves to be better known," he said.
With this movie Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize that you’re only working for prosperity, and now you’re just making one more movie,” Garci says after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the shoes of Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A dancer from Seville will pay tribute to a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three she will live in London with her family.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to play the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me.”
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban folk dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers,” she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with her who was his student.
"Matilde turns Tortola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me.”
The staging was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who played the role of the eternal comrade genre".
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of this woman who was exhibited in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it's these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows or values her work," Bayón says.
The show will start at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a recently married poet" in St. Stephen's Church in New York, the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to award their Nobel Prizes to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Li Ramón" (2006).
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia et Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after having traveled to the different Andalusian provinces, will go to the International Congress in New York.
In the same way, the Andalusian Ministry of Culture purchased eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets.
America Likes Less Without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in Absence of Malice, and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been touring since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels goes beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” Robert Redford said, “my life and my country were better because of his existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of film and homeland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are frightened, the esteem of Americans has fallen far, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, all that remains to human beings is admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the advocate of lost and defeated causes, such as the Anti-Drug Foundation created in honor of his eldest deceased following an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that has struggled to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He put us on the high bar,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who tries to break through the screen like Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious private life and away from goals.
This is still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal even though he did not miss the opportunities to not be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
“Of all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring and philanthropic grandfather,” he said.
Madrid in the race for the organization of the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could come true in 2016.
I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I’ve ever raced.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, these would be the subject of an eliminatory note.
But let’s look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
The mistakes begin with the removal of the bibs, which forces you to go ahead.
It’s not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for racing).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small size jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults took place from the barracks.
I think about 500 people will get pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, won't even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that I think didn't score the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, this one would not come to my mind.
So I believe that we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft introduced a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) in response to what was asked of him during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and she tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Awesome.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the essential instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
A change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary since it is the essential basis for understanding the hardware and software.
It holds the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your stepmother.
That's right. I'm sorry.
It will never disappear but we must see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed that idea.
People are paying less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who are half of the applications that come with the system?
Who can the most can the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer apps, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, congested month, less complex.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the restrooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage dispenser, a poster their request to use their own research tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week there was a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is delayed and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was wearing it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio was wearing one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as was Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the Muscle Gay Association's outfit.
And if we start to list all his apparitions, we could also mention that big mustache who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
It's not just a simple men's cotton body jersey, slim fit and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, by its unisex cut, by its distinctive logo and by the small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag that the most famous body jerseys have on their necks.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a pity to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new business in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but, at the same time, exciting day awaits us.
What is the basis of your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we are very inspired by it for our collections.
I really like walking around town and watching women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you are a very versatile woman, aren’t you?
I think so, but in the end it all comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to look in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you put on the clothes, that’s when you really put yourself in the character’s shoes.
As a result, everything is connected.
You were not long ago 30 years ago: has it been hard for you?
No, not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years make me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you'll be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me to, and moreover, I want to become a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Come to the movies, you wait for the different movies you made last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to come out.
I am a woman from the theater, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can’t wait for the movies ‘La última hora’ and ‘En busca de la tumba de Cristo’ to come out.
Let's see what you think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the catwalk to be a model.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in a charity parade in London for her women's advocacy association and the clothes we exhibited - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were auctioned off to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender-hearted person.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things are not true.
Besides, I'm fascinated by Naomi's good side.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to be a pear, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Alcohol drivers will have to install the ‘alcolock’ system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for blood alcohol, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle in a state of intoxication, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered as a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver by offering road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety but also the General Directorate of Road Safety and the Foundation Technological Institute for Automobile Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of intoxication, take back the car.
The alcoholock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow forward; or when the driver's level of alcohol is higher than the authorized level.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is at the expense of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of infractions during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This only applies to administrative penalties for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, the reform made by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some commercial and function vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install in school buses this system as it has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 17:40, the official scheduled time, the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez airport of Mexico City.
The sun was on the eve of sunset but its rays still required to put their hand as a visor to be able to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver in the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Ah, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... Are you from here or...?
- No, no sir, I'm Spanish but I lived here thinking two years.
- Oh, all right.
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are several waiting in the hangar of the airport near the red carpet and a military row consisting of 27 navy soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, while the Princess, with her hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual peep-toes; perhaps they had told her that a thunderstorm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing into the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny journalist from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The most prestigious award in fashion
There is surely no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is surely no living cartoonist more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of the new talents of fashion.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she cried almost with emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, made us end up in a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the extraordinary Chagals family as a neighbouring table, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having a big heart and making a good heart against bad luck, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a Mango garment and some ELAH adornments, which took her breath away, and arm in arm with her son Luis – a handsome man almost two meters high – she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rotchil ended the evening without jackets because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with trousers and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner transformed herself by wearing a sexy and black long dress, was moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of the rehearsals of the ballets and remembering the good old time.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the outbuildings of the palace, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man riding a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked beforehand that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to booksellers on September 30.
The wake-up call almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse when we think of the restless rhythm that current life imposes on us.
The desk is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
1001, not one more, not one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the bookstores directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places like work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run through your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk while they sleep.
The first time this happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
It is a benign disturbance of sleep that is called somnilloquia.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely there's more than one who talks at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (peeing in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, situations of stress or overexcitation.
In any case, it is an understudied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with cries, cries, long speeches...
In the event that sleep talk becomes very frequent, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep impairment that can be cured (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore look for quiet games and avoid programs or television series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleep talks appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless since he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is unusual), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You will not get anything, because while sleeping, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he is saying, but you will not know what he is dreaming of, so pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him overnight to learn his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don’t worry, this is nothing bad, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory on his field after a long period of hardship.
Without making a big match, the Yellows and Blacks created the greatest number of opportunities and managed to turn one for the win of the match.
The pace was not very fast during this meeting where the attackers had a hard time expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann who neared the skylight on a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern was going to take slightly the ascension and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Romain with the tip of the foot or Diebold came to tickle Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we were blocking in the middle of the field and we just left the stirring Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the Illhousiens goalkeeper will not be able to savor his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose great problems to an Illusian Eleven who just stepped back a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big scramble, the ball passed very close to the cross.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of the fishermen who strongly disrupted Monday the access of several Breton and Norman ports, the president of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the surge in diesel prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is awaited by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing blockages of nearly 10 km.
The marina at Quiberon was also blocked, but links to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not stopped.
A filter dam has been put in place on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination Monday by burning tires and pallets at dawn in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while protests were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Channel fronts, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers remained at the dock, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of merchant ships.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the important Total de Donges refinery in the evening.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave anything" and "do not want to move to Paris," announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the committee of fisheries of Lorient.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter but they estimate that the threshold of profitability of a boat is only reached with a diesel less than 0,30 euro per liter.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy and the Kid has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes saluted the film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft maker expects 215 aircraft delivered this year despite threats of recession looming over the global economy.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 deliveries forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado reaffirmed.
In the first half, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its business beyond its international life insurance and retirement business in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the matter.
AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to discuss possible divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG is considering to divest include its aerial leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these divestitures, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make cash to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders in due proportion.
Analysis Paris Session history Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange posted a historic drop Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq Index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 Index 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street plummeted after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bailout plan of the banks that was supposed to allow to regain some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favor, representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“It shows how much the market was counting on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come “too late.”
"If the project is indeed moribund ... then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the downfall of a financial institution" in the United States, said Ms. Piegza.
Following Washington Mutual’s bankruptcy on Friday, authorities arranged for the takeover of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has abruptly accelerated, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing "not only a US crisis, but a global crisis," the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.632% from 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year bond fell to 4.161% from 4.357% the day before.
Obama wins first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House was followed by another to know who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign HQs proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen said McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "brilliant" enough to stop him falling in polls five weeks into the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama was the winner for 39% of those polled, while 25% of them conceded victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his colleague, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts,” Clinton said at the weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has repeatedly highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while underlining the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama said he represents the future.
Without dismantling himself, he was concise and precise.
He stressed his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, while Obama has,” responded a Democrat ad this weekend blaming the Republican for not taking full measure of the impact of the crisis on the “street American.”
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election rally in North Carolina in a heavy rain.
He didn’t even pronounce the words “middle class” or “workers.”The financial defeat clearly benefits Obama, who is seen by Americans as the most capable of saving the economy at the brink.
“The coming week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final verdict of eight years of poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that he would still manage to cut taxes by 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street turmoil, the Illinois senator also pointed out that achieving the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wants to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Cautious, the two candidates sidestepped questions about the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) bailout plan adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents marched Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as polling stations in Minsk’s central square closed to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some admit they didn’t even vote: “What’s the point, since they’ll do what they want with my voice,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good appearance to foreign observers in order to regain language with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including banning visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and freezing certain assets, could be lifted if the elections were deemed clean by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the counting," said Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and with us, it is the executive branch.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, will recognize the validity of the election.
She points out that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
“Have you noticed that there was an election, you?” asks the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones that are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night falls on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
The Interview - Blood Became Safe Again
Héma-Québec was celebrating the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
And most importantly, he regained the public’s confidence that had been seriously shaken by the blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and the public's grumbling, the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that such a disaster should not occur again.
While Judge Krever was delayed in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee has fulfilled this mandate.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Services to supply all other provinces and the two territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began operations, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Thanks to efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground in the years that followed, we have regained the public's confidence," she said, before proudly stating that by the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile."
Since its inception on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were erupting in Europe, says the one that has held the fort since its founding in 1998.
“And we didn’t know at all if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when this is not known and serious illness can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, blood was refused to those who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Now, a few years ago, it was demonstrated beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which make it possible to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have helped shorten the silent period, which extends from the time the person was infected to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors may become infected unknowingly and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in every 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission occurs through a blood product.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to regain health," says the CEO of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary, noting that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
“The needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need to be recharged with red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which on average includes only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood.
Any healthy person 18 years of age and older who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a malaria country, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But the members of this donor network need to be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
“Today’s life is so unbridled, we rarely find time to spend an hour donating blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago the bankruptcy of our 1,000th cord blood sample and we plan to collect more than 1,000 per year.
We should start proposing it for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the Semi-Final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division playoffs, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 goal total) victory over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive quarter-final series goal total game at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a goalless first half on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals of the Montreal team.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first game of the round-robin series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still made it to the 5-4 semi-final round of goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the series details will be confirmed today.
In Brief - Kovalev's Victorious Goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win by the Canadian in the barrage shots against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian said.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to do too much in the first half," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation.”
Charest bets on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out starting elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon in Quebec City yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of today's by-election.
"Pushing the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the main lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of image mill.
On three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great resources as in electoral periods.
At a news briefing, the prime minister refused to rule out that he would trigger the election this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a workforce agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give a deadline, amounts of investment, or a specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, forestry, but especially the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's at home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it in us, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot in its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the press briefing.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
“There is a border line that hasn’t been agreed on for a very long time, and when the opportunity presents itself, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government,” he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open year-round due to the melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the Territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequistan MP for Ungava), have already begun consultations with some thirty communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the Liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Plant in Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Revolution tranquille and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party knew how to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In a press briefing, he invoked another reference, conservative one, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest noted that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"It remains between us, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, prompting loud applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
He points out that his schedule is, however, fulfilled, notably by a mission of the federation’s council to China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular demands recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and for them to have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad outlines of the Plan Nord were welcomed with skepticism.
The Pequistan leader, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Nord-du-Québec Development Policy that the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, renounced its application.
Had he done so, "we would have been more advanced today," commented Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (oh irony) in the Harper cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
The reproach of this woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
We have here a government that is the only one among all the Western countries involved who has not repatriated its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts that are being blamed on him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier die in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
As a reminder, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can enjoy a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper keeps brandishing and which sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Here comes the time when no morality exists anymore: one can arbitrarily mistreat, torture, imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a hitherto minority head of government (what will become of it after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Discourse of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of Canadian Barrick Gold Mining.
Pursuing Orwellian logic, he claims that the world’s largest gold company has filed a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small publisher without a penny in order to launch a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to frighten anyone who dares to look into the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before public opinion that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are normally held through the exchange of ideas and not with batons.
It was therefore enough for the mine to open its books, its files and to establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the financing of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both call for a "public" debate while scorning the opinions of that same public?
In the world of the vice-president, it seems that this word refers only to the well-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a gag lawsuit (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a notice against the authors of Noir Canada urging them to cease the use of this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s prosecution is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to be quoted from credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of repeated prosecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate prosecution makes it clear that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for academia, as it is for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been rocking Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the managers of the companies rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news just minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress toward an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done in a way that protects the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: If we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned into a sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect that would cause a new failure on the mood of investors.
The time limit we agreed was the opening of the markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election have been rather favorable to the agreement, without failing to express their dissatisfaction that we are forced to reach this extreme.
Democrat Senator Barack Obama has added some provisions to the deal, including one to allow homeowners to keep their homes and one on the salaries of the heads of state-rescued businesses.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on U.S. television.
Asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The broad outlines I’ve read [show] that it’s something we’re all going to have to digest and we’re going to be able to move forward with.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to redeem with taxpayer money the dubious, risky and unsold assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprimes) before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and leading to a liquidity freeze and the slump of banks and institutions.
It was a group of elected Republicans who overturned the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed that they have come out of this impasse since the Democrats accepted that some “toxic” assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to incur losses for five years under this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for a first tranche of $250 billion to be added to another $100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The additional $350 billion should be approved by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will be worth dividends in the event of a profit and that it can resell when the turmoil is over.
The federal government will have the option of delaying the seizure procedures for dwellings attached to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as setting limits on the remuneration and severance pay paid to the executives of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives as of today, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
Yesterday, in fact, votes continued to rise against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that benefits taxpayers.”
Host of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of skeptics," Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and to carefully consider the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three countries of Benelux announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was renounced to acquire its competitor in the middle of a shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, one recovers a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savers and households appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government seemed to be in the process of nationalising another bank that had been battered by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all the loans in progress at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than $41 billion (US $75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time his asset card, some will say his weakness.
Had he freed himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have him away from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
What a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of the freedom and breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate mark of quality.
For in him was projected a whole country in love with the self made man, the war fighter of the Pacific, wounded in combat, who in the early 50s studied dramatic art at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio of New York, before triumphing in the theater, in television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, paired with a sex symbol, although he was a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadowy areas of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the splinters of show-business, of which we will not have completely pierced the enigma.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman caused dizziness to moviegoers this weekend, as his big roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of ever-changing American seventh art parades through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Hot Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, reprised after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliant The Sting (The Scam), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar out of nine nominations.
That face through the ages, it was him.
He's back.
The times are moving through his path.
The young people know him mainly through the cult Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With a final role as a godfather of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against several film legends who left the profession early, Newman will have remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendors and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging its performances too supported.
The profession was not always tender for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles fell for a long time.
He played, however, less often the young first than the marginals: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect features reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true pudic sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, traced a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to an overdose dedicated to him his film Harry and Son in 1984, work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the disappeared actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the Hollywood drifts.
We will have seen many of his benette sit on jars of dressing, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, although gag at first.
The profits from these sales were nonetheless paid to his Foundation for Children in Trouble.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Model citizen, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag & amp; Company manufacture in their invoice factory?
Hearings on the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will soon begin on 8 October.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly significant damages. Other charges have been indicted against them, such as falsehood and use of falsehoods.
According to the prosecution, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and municipalities, about HUF 65 million in total, went on the one hand into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand into the pockets of some people.
Their method, which was also made public by the investigating authorities, was to get the money from the grants obtained by issuing expense bills, behind which no real benefit was provided and thus, the associations never met their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they procured invoice books at the Józsefváros market, while they made the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, this was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the deposition of the latter, he had to locate pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they realized the other invoices that they were going to introduce, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for drafting the files necessary to obtain the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, which would later be known as Együtt a Harmadik Evezredert, was full of errors in form and substance.
A guest house, located in Badacsonytomaj, had in reality only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice mentioned one hundred and thirty guests.
Invoice issuers with an overwhelming imagination also fell into excess when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither the name of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért nor that of the Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the prosecutor's office.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew right away that they were fake documents.
“Our company name and our tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp.”
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the invoice, a hundred people had stayed there, also did not fit, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have so much room.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices also did not inquire about the Budapest travel agencies, being part of their choice, but only organizing trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which is also contrary to the accounting practices of the agency.
In addition, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while services relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp on the order of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért was incorrect, since the services of the company do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, the employees of the hotel only issue printed invoices, while the false handwritten invoices were repaid.
The prosecution's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes in mentioning the carriage of goods by road as a service, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment advisory.
In addition, it was also for defects of forms, such as inadequate invoice types and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, of XXI.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó sports camp, which both deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time when (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Invoices deliberately established
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were required to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták group, has issued an invoice to the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Likewise, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület association.
There was no financial movement either, as the invoices issued were later cancelled, but the agencies avoided mentioning this in their accounts.
The next category of invoice-issuing companies is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the general manager of the company Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where he was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Ivan Kubatov also reportedly sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their countervalue.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies were operating, which the accused explains by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He used these companies anyway, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the acts of foundation of the companies, he prepared invoices to their names, to the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generación.
Kubatov has issued 15 invoices totalling HUF 14.2 million from Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor's office thought that 10% of the sums indicated on the invoices as well as the VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices that were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generación Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a grant application to the socialist party's public utility organization, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this subsidy for an amount of twice HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from being known, five fictitious invoices received from the company Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a portion of the defendants will report on the method of making the invoices, as they had done before the Prosecutor's Office previously.
What might be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confession is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to recount the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or else, possibly, the Socialists would have reached an agreement according to which in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vexed, as requests for his placement under house arrest, based on an alleviation of his conditions of detention, continually fall into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of economic crimes that cannot be repaired, walk freely or at least wait at their own home for the end of the procedure.
The Psychology of Overbidding: Why Are We Spending More Money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at New York University have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans do not want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they prefer to pay too high a price.
This research attempted to draw a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was playing the lottery, while the other group was taking part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) process, the researchers were analyzing the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the over bid of a third, the whole being under the brainstem, called the striatum, began to move intensively during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight in front of the violent striatum reaction.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
During these, three groups overbid a partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15, in reward.
While the third group received that $15 before the auction, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was on one on victory, while on the other on failure.
Proving the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the team of players "against failure" were willing to bet higher than those made by the control group and the group "for the victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped remove the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor in the Faculty of Economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when should we see a doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
There are an estimated one hundred thousand patients with hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven thousand are receiving treatment, which is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases engendered differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is recommended to get vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach ache and nausea.
Then a visible jaundice develops on the skin and on the white of the eye, the stool becomes lighter and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not aware of the virus, because the pathogenic gene sneakly destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms do not appear until after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users, and tattooed people.
There are currently 200 million people with chronic hepatitis C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your treating doctor immediately upon the observation of symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a sort of analgesic, which would already have contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing to what extent belief in God could influence the pain tolerance of the human being.
As part of this at least bizarre experience, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university participate.
More precisely, the experiment takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and scattering electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked participants in the experiment to look sustainedly at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experiment hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, focused on its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking at either religious-themed or more general-themed painting.
The Catholics said that at the sight of the Virgin Mary they felt like “safe,” like someone who is “cared for” and they “called down, and peace invaded them.”
In view of the painting of religious themes, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the experiment himself, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
"We should find an image that they react to very positively, such as a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, an Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
“The practice of faith is expected to change and in many cases, it actually changes our personality,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, it remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if the believers were shown a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the sight of a better quality Virgin Mary cause better results?
You are what you divulge about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found in the bottom of people's pockets just like the sky above their heads. It knows where they have spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what their interests are.
It is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
As for the skeptics who draw a parallel to Orwell’s vision of horror, they just don’t see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google's founders can meet their original goal that sounded like this: "Let's collect in one system all the information in the world!".
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of global upheaval work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all information.
To the question: what will be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What would work best for me?". However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, until the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages consulted by the interested parties are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have searched for, what they have clicked on.

What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who worry about seeing Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can elicit fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can elicit in Internet users a counter-reaction.
It is, however, a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing an identification.
Human rights-conscious Internet users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm in arm with the electronic legal protection body EFF, proved its right in court before the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will still not be able to be obliged by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information about this secret FBI request, of whatever nature.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had gained compared to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted on several years ago. But ultimately, it fails to obtain the search lists of private users, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
So Google’s judgment is quite contradictory: it is smeared by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they are attacking them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against the multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "wild ones" bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "connected corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as invading the world because of Windows, and this even if both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what the Web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, draws precisely behind it.
Indeed, Web 2.0 is about nothing but collaboration, the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the communication channels at our disposal, and while the size of these changes one by one, the main thing remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xangai, and he can even link these to other features, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link these to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also automatically keep their blogs in stock, in which more photos appear.
While we can take note of many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands at the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that fired one of its employees, just for the sincere opinions that this one has written on his blog.
The person who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how we can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of today's young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to bypass Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who, deliberately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the slightest. Google's online services, through the processing of text to image processing, to the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to the better profiles, which have our huge n' profiles and that our servers.
The public awaits, without really hiding, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense ad domains threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at an increasing speed cause serious migraines not only to Microsoft creators, but to many other computer programs.
However, critical observers find, beside all this, contradictions having disturbing effects: for example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the corporate kindergarten and after the company has deemed too expensive the Chinese government's daily multiple restoration, taken at any time.
According to one of the internal rules of the company, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is on is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that the project of scanning and archiving of books and magazines of Google is taking on so important dimensions that the society will soon find itself under the full-faced one-
The fact that Google mounts a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The famous Cory Doctorow novel, written with Orwellian halftones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a startling way only through Google data.
Two miners helped remove traces of <0xC3><0x93>zd’s double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to be questioned in the case of <0xC3><0x93>zd's double homicide. Based on well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime," - said the spokesman of the Borsod department police station.
The young people have acknowledged the facts they are being accused of, and for the time being, they are being accused of complicity.
The two minors, who according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, are defending themselves free.
Complicity in murder can lead to detention of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local young man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are manslaughter, committed with premeditation and out of interest.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and it is for this reason that he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, 9 years old.
According to MTI information, the young man premeditated his crime, which is evidenced by the weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden at the crime scene.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech kroner, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that, previously, the Czechs excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The cause of this exclusion is that the Warsaw stock exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to secede from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid to date for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague stock exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw stock exchange would be the new least good owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague stock exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by market specialists to be between CZK 5 billion and CZK 10 billion.
Based on an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent stakes, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday comments on the international financial crisis, which is getting worse by the day, the leading European newspapers are already talking about a "second September 11".
"The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president," accuses the Rome daily, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a hurry, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett evoked, it is more appropriate to speak of a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing every day, and thereafter, the whole world will pay the heavy price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, a real danger threatens, that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer, says the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states can still give a lifeline to their failing financial organizations, and with taxpayer money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to pay little attention to their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, the Viennese daily Der Standard said, adding that fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in their pockets, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent from one side to the other.
The "rescuers" should not immediately brandish a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch the money of the taxpayers, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
Smart Car Imitates the Flight of the Bumblebee
What better way to develop barrier-avoiding technologies than by imitating an existing barrier detector in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the starting strategic idea, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-robot control system, type BR23C, which it equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval in shape, which in reality, very much resembles our secure protective shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and technological public relations of the brand.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a primary role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which transforms it into an avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid the collision.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
“If this were not the case, the mini robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that the bees possess to avoid the other bees, in our case, only the rotary movement, the acceleration as well as the slowing down could be used as maneuvers available to the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and with a higher energy concentrate, making their lifespan longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not data processing, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism must process only a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don’t need a memory capacity of gigabytes, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards designing a technology for instant avoidance, which Nissan estimates will make its way into mass-produced cars within the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles in his path.
We even gave the priceless baby a name
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout, aimed at buying back dubious loans from banks, and to use in multiples, is ready.
In the first round, half of that money will be spent.
Reuters said in further debates until after midnight on Saturday, Congressional leaders agreed on the controversy that has been going on for days on end over the $700 billion bailout.
"We've taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairwoman of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which all that remains is to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born out of the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question, here, of the rescue of Wall Street, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. local Washington time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., according to Central European local time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill that responds to the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
Moreover, the program differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which mentioned that the $700 billion should be spent in one go, on the repurchase of securities on dubious loans.
From now on, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after Congress passes the law, probably on Monday. This first sum will be used by the Treasury Secretary to buy dubious loans from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion is dependent on a new Congressional decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase dubious receivables, securities relating to dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" receivables.
Competent departmental officials said the buybacks can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools causing the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast buyback of dubious receivables, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system leading to the collapse of one or another major financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank managers who find themselves in bad posture and waiting for state help can expect their severance pay, simply called the golden parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
Wage caps are mentioned only in specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat provides assistance to the business.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat purchases through an auction, they will levy a surplus gold parachute tax unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the repurchase of dubious receivables, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the amount paid to executives is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it is still necessary to add that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling applies only to new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in U.S. history that legal caps will be in place on appointments of directors general, said the chairman of the committee in charge of financial benefits of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the state acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks involved in the plan, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, since they can even win in the case as soon as the economy and with it the rescued banks fall back on their feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must introduce to Congress a proposal that will rule on how losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why American citizens have mandated us, this doesn’t protect taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
Her Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same people who are pressing for action that are responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to the month of August 2007 - informs the Hungarian Central Bureau of Statistics.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 percent compared to July 2008, while compared to a year earlier, they decreased by 3.9 percent.
As a result of fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices increased only to a lesser extent: by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry were only slightly higher than in July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was seen in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), with firstly, the manufacture of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 percent, then, the production of shoes with a monthly increase of 2.5 percent.
The higher prices of plastics and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemicals and chemicals manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the petroleum processing (1.4 percent), electrical machinery and appliances manufacturing (0.9 percent), and a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry recorded an increase, ranging from 0.2 percent to 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which account for a significant share of domestic industrial operations, prices rose 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the effect of the rise in gas prices imposed by the authorities since 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, it was the prices of the oil processing sector that saw the most significant increase (32.4 percent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price decreases occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5%), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3%).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
In the processing industry as a whole, prices increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 percent higher than the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and according to sector allocation, in August, the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 percent) was in the profit-on-investment initiating sectors.
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and material-producing sectors for further processing did not change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the sectors of energy production and materials for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was 6.8 percent, while in the profit-initiating sectors, a decrease of 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, while they suffered a decrease of 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro, and by 7.1 percent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that by January 12, the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
“Now it all depends on when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic are put into service.”
All the time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to check in before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations starting today in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will award the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank bailout
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, assured their support for the government’s $700 billion bailout, but there are politicians demanding the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury’s resignation.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they have concluded agreements in principle on the plan to bail out the banks.
This financing plan, aimed at thawing the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each more fit than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the economic issues coming out, Obama has again managed to get a little bit of advance, McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as collaborator right after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly vote on the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supports.
"Now is the time to act responsibly ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sector and the stability of the entire economy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He called McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all have a hard time swallowing it ... but doing nothing is not a possible way.”
The Republican senator said that in the proposal, the creation of a Treasury Board and the cap on senior executive severance pay are mentioned, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, president of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press review of the German linguistic territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that the voters have become more aware - this is what Der Spiegel evokes, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of the reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades, and now these same modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
This change of epoch is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday came to an end a process that was likely ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was picking up 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. at the time of the much-repeated Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents", implemented in the region consistently by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the rhythm. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of northern and eastern Germans in the developing region of Bavaria could not remain without consequences for the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of conventional citizens that have rather moved away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, the artisans, the holders of the baccalaureate and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, UHC support fell below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on reserve in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily newspaper deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that has set in after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian SP<0xC3><0x96> Socialists want to talk with the <0xC3><0x96>VP Conservatives.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from meddling in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> populist party is open to negotiations and the Greens are not yet ready to agree on the coalition.
Elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates organized on public television, party leaders barely let their cards glimpse.
SP<0xC3><0x96> President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to talk to the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer approach was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or the entry into the coalition is for the moment a completely open question. These points must absolutely be debated within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, is once again open to any proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of the reds and blacks, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities," Haider said.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began in Paris as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary, as one of the main spokespersons for the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz European People's Party MEP, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is a violation of the right that most affects Roma children and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil organisations, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the deputy group Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka warned that in addition to the distinctions observed during the hiring, the Roma disappear from the labor market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of low-quality elementary education, only a tiny fraction has the possibility of obtaining a higher education diploma."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as an elementary human right plays a key role when it comes to asserting other fundamental rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economies of EU member states.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma child starts school, the more likely he is to become a productive member of the labour market; by the taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"Through their European Union nationality, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and protected from low-quality, sectarian education." - underlined Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, a goal-oriented and action-oriented collaboration of the European Union is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. For this, compliance with the existing and preparing anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities that democracy provides, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - demanded Járóka.
In the name of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for all, the objective of the Equal Opportunities Summit in Europe, which has been held every year since last year's summit in Berlin, is to provide a single platform to support measures to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination, both at European level and at Member State level.
CSU: Grace for a Transition Period
It is in October that the decision on the fate of the deceased duo Huber-Beckstein will be made
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed.
The chairman of the party, Erwin Hube, and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their seats. The question is how long will the pardon last?
The fate of the tandem, which has suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the congress of the exceptional party, held the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, in any case, made it feel that they did not hold especially to their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the faction and the base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it's true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
But the Conservatives still count heavily in this southern region, of key importance for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the vice-president and the federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates tasting discussions with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the eventual Munich Free Governments, formed along with the values of the right.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Strober served as a coup possibility perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, then treated without mercy the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now the leaders of the CSU are putting all their energy into stabilizing, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now was pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role.The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some harsh remarks to the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be Chancellor again if they re-establish in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not negatively influence the Berlin Grand Coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the Social Democrats still lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition deputies entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been doing very well of opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term of office as president for the fourth time during the dubious elections.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically increasingly dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as undemocratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians did not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the Russian opposition, imported more and more.
The fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the campaign, emphasized positive changes rather than flaws, such as the ban on running for a third of opposition candidates, referred to prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
In spite of all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have regained their freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. Now, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, considers the two territories already independent.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backward, but the most important is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU," Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that "the power was afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to bring in even a single opponent".
The opposition is not planning to take action to protest the results, but is trying to convey its message about the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of worries on this side: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us in the wheels when it comes to broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of elderly people" - said Milinkevich as regards the most prominent, referring to the fact that in the current social regime of Luhansk.
"Because of the country's debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," said Milinkevitch.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never in the history of the Chigi Palace have there been any revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But as of today, this new measure is in force against the clever little ones, against whom he points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-lazy novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services," says the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta said.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complemented by the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of the employees was recorded, the secretary-general assures: "it is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution."
During a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration Publique
In Rome, the minister communicated that "in three months, the absences of sickness of public employees have decreased by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make public administration more efficient.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well beyond the inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees came together to challenge the Brunetta decree standards using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service today spreads the data regarding the decrease of absenteeism in the workplace because of illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the "active lazy" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive Public Administration employees gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in case of infirmity due to service, the extension of the hours of home permanence of the sick worker, during which the control visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister, are contested.
Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that there were about 1,200 white deaths.
These figures show the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic aspect, the Anmil is celebrating today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, which was institutionalized on the second Sunday in October.
"The disturbing data released by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuous associative effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of accident workers, assistance to the families of the victims and awareness of public opinion".
"Naturally indignant, everyone has struck their fist to put an end to such tragedies that, by their dimension, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not underestimate the alarm about social gravity, apply and improve legislative norms.
For his part, the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to end it quickly".
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but that does not prevent the number of white deaths is still impressive," said later the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
We do not want this "discount trend" to translate into a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes that the tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, not enough is done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
“According to us,” said Mercandelli, “more controls and inspections are needed, as well as more intervention on the training of workers, and this, right from the school.”
- He added- "there is still a need to make an effort in terms of communication and public awareness.
"But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "drift of assistance towards which the system is moving in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance," he added, "so that the fate of the one who has an accident, must not depend on the spontaneity or enlargement of the legislature."
Mp3 player pointed finger, they put at risk hearing.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a statement released in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
“From this scientific report, 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than an hour a day and a week, risk permanent loss of hearing.”
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones, may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We also need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
The scientists confirm that there is good reason for concern, and that the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit this data by using solutions such as reducing noise levels and duration of exposure.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for prolonged periods, risk permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years.
This concerns 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable fixed by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will finalise the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there," Alemanno stressed, "it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome that will be used by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council.
No overlap of roles, but only the will to have a corner where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March, it will finish its tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporal duration.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale.
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper prospect, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens, and will be used to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "we need a strategic reference draft, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit, ".
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but that will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital, but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to pass himself off as an independent wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
The attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
Obama is really bold: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and they do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an article: Once in the voting booth, we know very well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
Here emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
“Say what you want, we’ll see if we can cross Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the buttocks.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
In spite of this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush’s weak point.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
In the United States, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attachés, feeling less concerned about the credibility.
They do not feel as isolated as they once did.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on assembling the newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism, as it is understood by the general public, is not to be substantially reduced.
An obvious but complex pessimism pervades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and journalists from print newspapers are convinced that national-level journalism is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are making a transition to the Internet, perceived by many as the "assassin" of newspapers.
The “economic pressure” felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to getting into technology hoping it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest conundrum in American journalism lies between who runs the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of managers at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to "work safety".
Directors who expect to lose their jobs in the space of 3 years, are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we go to 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 thousand a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, after a certain number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “sick” during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REST IN GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl escalation investigation.
During his trial last week, he was granted house release, which was converted into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be allowed to travel from the provincial city to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the prosecutor did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence accusing him.
Elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion bailout approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms this by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its vigilant East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, precisely, which made itself felt despotically with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just one example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake foreshadows or already lets go: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been bred for some time, to the point that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category State-sovereign, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that obviously have close relations with foreign countries, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of people and families who live in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears global economically but politically, it is almost only national here.
Political internationalisation seems really out of the question, or rather, it has little to say: the obvious evidence is provided to us by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, is unable to decide any common political lines.
And so, it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all an affection of credits: when you go through a difficult period, it is only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose of in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the nation-state crisis is moreover in perfect harmony with the ever-greater importance that more recent economic developments tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of the ever more sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at one stroke, that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with the things rather unmaterial.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly possesses more maps than he who is not, that is, he who has the misfortune of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably called Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadows.
And in addition, something even deeper, in a sense, even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and of being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more foreign to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership, subterraneanly fuels a powerful and branched movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised "revolts" electoral or else, in the changes in the collective moods of the latter by recent times, from the right-wing conservative rise in Austria to Bavaria, to the fall of the Great Labourists.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say someone, have ever more difficulty, which does not date from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and potentially agitates in a depressing way.
In view of all this, talking about a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
Keeping your eyes wide open is not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with super glue and, in the future, step on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring barely 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to hold a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that allow to ensure the animal, a perfect adhesion.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it “gets easily detached from the wall,” said Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton School of Engineering.
WALK ON WALLS? – “This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” Liming Dai adds.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, given that carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair, which self-cleans dust during movement on a surface to ensure a perfect and constant adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juices.
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital medications, alter their absorption, amplifying or decreasing according to the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia, he raises a new alarm, putting patients at risk: just a glass of grapefruit juice and annum health.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized because it is held responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antistem and neurological drugs, up to toxic levels.
It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger deriving from this mix and to pay attention to what one drinks, if one takes medicines such as, for example, Diazepam or Methadone.
According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, said: "These findings are generally immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies, which will have to change the information notes of the drugs if necessary.
It is always appropriate to read the illustrative papers of the medicines you are taking, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert told Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron’s bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article published in the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked many controversies, and which was reproached to the economist for years, but which now has proved accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist" but also an "aggressive" divulger, particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism.
Open Office is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
Today is the release day of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to the public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various novelties: from the welcome screen, and the interface revised and become less austere, to others more important, such as the compatibility born for the latest operating system Apple Mac OS X.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some functions specific to some modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files in the graphic development module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that join the typical graphic of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the elaboration of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is in addition to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can be shipped home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a means to spread it in homes, it is precisely in the business, that the Open Office suite tries the great challenge, can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008, reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
Another case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl’s specimens are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation EPO was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, snatching the polka dot jersey from the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES QUESTIONS IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of migrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
The New York Times has devoted a long article to discussing the issue of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are both those where there is "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Northern League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
This trend was highlighted by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student housing market is not experiencing a crisis
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants union, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin have to support," explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia design office, "in these cities, the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase has even begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free, unregistered, no rent limit, sub-leases.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the taxation, are necessary to calm the prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from a minimum of 650 euros (Black Stripe area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), we ask about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
One can save only if one goes away in the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one it costs from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, it is necessary to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, in cities such as Perugia, where rents are often taken by extra-community students, there is a further anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, cities elect historic halls.
The historic cinemas close in favor of the Multiplexes.
“A city without movie theaters is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major urban centers of Italy, but also in the cities of province,
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the great multi-salas, and the death of consumption of the mono-salas in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems to us inevitable and indisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and full of memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we have shared a bit of a path and so many emotions" observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar lost as well as the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and who can tell the story of our cinema.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the cinemas of the main cities that have mostly paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romagna leads with 82 single-stage cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that confirms that the main responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the ANEC, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of credit in favor of merchants: the antecedent debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is disgraceful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to solve the situation through the signing of a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote single-room cinemas in historic centers and in the periphery.
Among the regulations foreseen, there are measures of tax facilitation in favor of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the area with limited traffic, and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
"This is an initiative that I like", observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by implementing other measures.
However, it is obvious that to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me, has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much of shared emotions, I turn to the other side so as not to see the panels blackened by dust.
Links between politician and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the City Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
The magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria have launched heavy accusations against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The levers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, namesake of the boss, already convicted of association of criminals of the mafia type, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral standards, and above all common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges - to enter officially inside the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and orientation of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional committee, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also a lot of politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest.”
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, after which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
As early as the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and again because of presumed conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the SVP at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a center-right coalition, after the May 2006 balloting.
He shouted to the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, of having manipulated the whole thing for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the prosecutors write, emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniformizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born from the waves, now the big ones are launched.
This is an oversized deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the world’s major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources that colossi like Chevron have set their eyes on, and now they are trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by sea swell operating systems.
That would be twice the amount that nuclear power plants produce.
And besides, there would be the currents and the tides..
Colossus on the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in Northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a real revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more of these companies, which have always been dedicated to traditional energy, are relying on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," a spokesperson for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit deliberated by the American Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that precisely in Alaska, the United States continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, who travel the path of energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested to date, although their details are not known, indicate, according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its infancy, due to the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears of environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
“And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the sludge up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure drives a turbine, which in turn powers a generator.
Energy is sent to shore through submarine cables.
At the moment, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and parking lot using six underwater turbines on New York’s East River.
The movement of water during the tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotary movement that powers a generator.
Verdant announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw on energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, deserves right now, the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coasts, invested $7.5 million in 2008 and forecasts investments up to $35 million in 2009.
