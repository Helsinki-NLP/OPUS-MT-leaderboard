Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned "that they will be taken for puppets"
Dismay among some of the members of the Assembly, now referred to as AM, by the suggestion that they should change their name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate arose from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the House of Representatives from all over the world fear being ridiculed.
A Labour Party member said his group was concerned that the new name "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don’t know Welsh, “twp” means “fool” and “pwp” means “poop.”
A member of the party Plaid Cymru stated that the group as a whole was "unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" regarding the name change, but noted that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed strong support for the name of the Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the issue of the AM title, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received a majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AM are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules for disabling AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what they should be called when discussing legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country’s name
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer at the price you have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells remain silent as Harlem churches continue to fight
“The elders I spoke to said that before there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“Today, neither one thing nor the other.”
He said he could understand that the bars had disappeared.
“People now socialize in other ways,” he said.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to."
As for churches, he fears that money from the sale of assets may not last as long as leaders expect, and “sooner or later they will go back to where they started.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the kind of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
“The overwhelming majority of the people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore they will accelerate the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of those churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of stores on 125th Street, a Harlem shopping street that was reluctant to hire and promote black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as father Johnson's customers made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who changed it to the larger carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin during the last months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the body that governs the parish and which is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing its concern that the latter "pretends to pass on the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some protesters complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures Boy While Fishing Lobsters in California
Police said a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while fishing for lobsters in California on the first day of the crustacean season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving for about half an hour with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, at which point he swam with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just excitement to catch a lobster, but that he soon realized that he was shouting "They worked me!
They worked on me!”
Hammel said he realized it when he got to the boy.
“I smiled at everyone who came out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The first responder, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they had spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to the upper torso.
Officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to those in the department stores full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK beauty market, which amounts to <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as sales in fashion and household products fall, the biggest runners with beauty products will be tested at 11 stores across the country, and then switch to others next year if successful.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product offering to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with exclusive zones similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are vegan-friendly, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions at two Sainsbury’s establishments; the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the second will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a shift that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive chairman of Sainsbury's, said the establishments would increasingly resemble shopping malls as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat outlets in hundreds of stores, as it bought both chains two years ago. This apparently boosted grocery sales and profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute the revenues of pharmacies in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It was commented that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the image of our beauty runners to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff that you can turn to for advice.
Our product range is designed to fit all needs and the attractive and convenient locations mean we are now a cosmetic destination that defies old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones walked away "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby retired from an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for his Truly home apparel and accessories brand.
His company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host used Instagram to announce her farewell.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones sparking as he retired from his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "furious" when the television golden girl admitted during a tense meeting held Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to devote to both Truly's homewear and accessories brand.
The business was even compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, turned to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved in the project stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow’s offices ready to sell.”
Experts believe that leaving the host of This Morning is among Britain’s most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, due to considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home textiles, and that it could further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents to three children and have had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host on ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we shouldn't comment on his business affairs."
It’s a difficult conversation, and then we fall in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said by putting on his voice as a “newscast presenter.”
“I gave up nothing.”
He said Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump considers a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three pesos after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at Saturday's United Nations General Assembly that the North sees no "corresponding response" by the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he stressed, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
“Things are going well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free the hostages and bringing the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual strategy when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheater, we would have about 200 people standing here,” Trump told the crowd.
An earthquake and tsunami devastate an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international aid, so it is a challenge," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national agency for disaster management, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could contribute their help.
Given the constant earthquakes Indonesia endures, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been built in Aceh, it is not common to find them on other coasts.
Although an alert had been issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren on Palu likely contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of cases, traveling between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia's deteriorated infrastructure, and lavished money on roads and railroads.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is plagued by a great lack of funds in the final straight to next year’s re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative way of life.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to flee their homes because of street clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the tie goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before firing a shot at the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced to the top left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga jumping in the air and entering the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position, to organize ourselves, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I came up to Kante and I said a touch without thinking too much and I just shot.”
Chelsea won 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning near the half-shift and rushing into Liverpool's field.
Kovacic made a wall in the center of the field.
He made a beautiful deep pass driving Hazard into the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up on the second stick scoring with a left-handed shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool face Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the national disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped among the debris of the buildings that fell in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday that caused waves of up to 6 meters, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered in debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Was Stabbed to Death
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked people in the area who saw or heard something to take a step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan stated, "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make an appeal to anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us who has seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to capture anything with the dashboard camera to contact us, as they could have key information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belonged to a neighbor in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was that morning.
The investigation continues as police say they are in the process of informing the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just attempted to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that they do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that they will not be able to enter again until within a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There was a woman on the scene crying.
He says, “It’s awful.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament becomes the last monument to be affected by the struggle to "rewrite history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatical and puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "funny" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster became the target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of 19th-century opinion, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to still deserve homage.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was about the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the mid-17th century conflict defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Pig kills a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
Last Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by his nickname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered in blood near a corral at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to put the vaccines to the pigs in a barn on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to another adjacent cortijo.
He said there was a large male in the barn with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing almost 250 kilos, attacked the farmer to the point of killing him.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and crushed,” the cousin, nicknamed “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence on the stage.
It seems that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, cases of pigs attacking humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 300 kilos cornered a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs aren't usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "shooter.
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... they have no intention of doing harm.
You just have to have the respect you need,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy, widespread rainfall to the southwestern U.S.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it flies over the cold waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a surge begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward, toward the East Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward, which will penetrate the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with the wave will create abundant and widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will approach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50–100 l/m2 of rainfall is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
We strongly advise against venturing into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form canyons that could become floating rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally cracked winds and dust.
The wave will bring locally heavy rainfall to parts of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause flow of minor debris and slippery roads.
These would be the first rains from the region's wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain spreads late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature swings in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This can lead to significant changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the U.S.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm beginning of October is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probabilities of above-average temperatures for the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people have followed on six television channels the passionate testimonies of Supreme Court nominated judge Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual schedule for a breaking news Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had played them while he was drunk and that he had tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company featured media audiences on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people who watch television from offices.
To get an idea, it is an audience similar to a football final or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long trial, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had $3.1 million, NBC $2.94 million, MSNBC $2.89 million, and CNN $2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was Friday's central figure on television.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement stating it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being slapped by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator on his way to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He remained staring down for several minutes while he was reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They told him, "You have the power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said his office made a statement Flake, before the elevator was closed, added that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All television and cable channels were broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination before the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee the following week, which a minority of Democrats urged.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May’s so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the other side’s tariffs was “totally absurd”.
Wayde Sims Killed: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspected shooter who killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU (Louisiana State University).
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on a charge of second-degree murder.
Officers broadcast the video of the clash between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the stage and claimed they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said they admitted to being the shooter who killed Wayde.
The defense said he was charged with a $350,000 bail.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Unit, the State Police Forensics Lab, and Southern University Police for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01-year-old was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season’s average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's passing.
“That’s what worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ash over Mexico City
The ashes thrown by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several bangs and tremors.
Social media footage showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clash between Catalan police and separatists ahead of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote on Catalonia’s secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists contained by riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them and created clouds of dark dust in the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
There were also later remarks on the same day with the police, who used the clubs to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "Neither Forgiveness nor Forgiveness" clashed with Unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries received in the protest, according to local media.
Tensions continue to rage in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters opted overwhelmingly for independence, although turnout was low and opponents of secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent confrontations.
Pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
The protest also took place, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence rally with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia’s independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying for joy when I was able to vote, but now we are in a bind,” he said.
Despite obtaining a narrow, albeit decisive, victory in the regional elections last December, this year the pro-independence Catalan parties struggled to maintain the momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in a self-imposed exile or detained pending trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections the following year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Car Hit a House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly attacked a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (summer time in Britain).
Police Investigation Inspector Bob Blemmings declared the grid and the building itself to have been damaged.
It is also possible that a bullet was fired at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
Ascended Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise one level by placing after the Hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still out of the league this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, from which they are separated by eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remain undefeated in the division for a sixth straight game; head coach Holt has not been defeated since replacing Kenny Miler.
Livingston misses opportunities in the face of weakened visitors
Holt's team had to advance well before the time they scored, as their control caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but his crossfire did not cross the threshold of the goal; then, Alan Lithgow's shot came out propelled by a header from Craig Halkett from the other side of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger visitors in stop-and-go plays.
And that’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston made a serve in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces to secure Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession but encountered an impenetrable defense that spared guard Liam Kelly much work.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers guard Allan McGregor halted Scott Pittman's shot with his feet, and Lithgow sent the ball out in another shot to Livingston's standing ball.
Many cross passes were made in the Livingston area that were continuously cleared, while two penalty requests were rejected: one for the hand and one for a Halkett inning to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Fantastic' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
"And unanimously, they were excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their upward trajectory.
His playing style and players have barely changed since he returned to the top tier, but part of the merit lies with Holt for the way he has propelled the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, proudly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga gave neither Connor Goldson nor Joe Worrall a single breath throughout the game.
The Rangers are lacking in inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's orders, this time they did not reach that level.
They missed the last pass. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. An entire warning call for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which seeks to settle relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city has the largest population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters came to see his president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division before a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Traffic Accident: Cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The crash comes months after another cyclist died in a runaway hit-and-run on Childers Street just over a mile from Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and they are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officers were wounded in an altercation in the high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the riots, in which eight inmates who are contained in a pavilion are implicated.
Officers were treated for minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Prison personnel specially trained to deal with a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin have been deployed.
Six staff members had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin hosts more than 500 prisoners, among them some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials had to go to jail to quell a riot in which staff were assaulted with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (dry-affected places could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is very likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and the last hour of Monday is expected to arrive with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained depression or tropical storm status within a 320-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended within a 64-kilometer radius of the Arizona border.
The National Meteorological Service's latest models predict 50 to 10 l/m2 of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 on the Mogul Border of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could reach up to 25 or 50 litres, with isolated totals of 100 l/m2 being possible.
For those who are out of danger from sudden flooding, Rosa's rain could be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-largest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on Mexico’s Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which will still have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with winds of a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heads north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is encountering cold water in the Pacific and thus losing strength.
For this reason it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday night.
It could rain very heavily in some areas of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall is expected to be between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwestern Sonoran, and up to 250 l/m2 can be encountered," reports weather.com.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continue to climb through Arizona and enter southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger from Rosa or what remains of it is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the Southwestern Desert of the U.S.," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause sudden waterfalls and debris flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Assault: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder to find a 16-year-old boy with gunshot wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 04:00 (summer time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to the Somerset police, three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 respectively were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
The officers asked for the help of anyone who had a recording of the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the pettiness and anger' of the Democratic Party
“To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered the pettiness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that on that day the "Americans" were witnesses to Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with a record of clean public service," he said, addressing the West Virginia crowd.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t do it, but I really do,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates.”
Trump has argued that the Democrats’ mission is to “oppose and hinder.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican aide told CNN.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami kills hundreds and numbers continue to rise
Authorities said Saturday that at least 384 people had died, many of them swept away by giant waves that broke off the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke into the ground at Luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were killed,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, homes, it razed everything it found,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many shops and destroyed buildings, twisted and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The riots continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, set at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantous" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications were "completely paralyzed and there is no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In a fan tape shared on social media, a man standing on the top floor of a building can be heard frantically screaming warning people on the street of the arrival of a tsunami.
In a matter of minutes the water crashes against the ledge carrying forward buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that caused the cut off of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Authorities say the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still in urgent need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has been reopened but only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's awful.
During the journey that the staff of World Vision traveled to reach the city of Palu, where the employees hide in canvas shelters erected in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, remarked Mr. Doseba.
“I was told that many houses were destroyed,” he said.
It's awful.
Even as the groups began the unpleasant task of starting disaster assistance, some complained that they were preventing foreign humanitarian workers with extensive knowledge and experience from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can flow only if the site of the disaster is declared a national catastrophic zone.
And that hasn’t happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open up to international aid, but that time has not yet arrived.”
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, family and friends of the missing clung to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that lightened the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled a child out of a sink.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa hotel’s collapse among the paragliding community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, in the messages only one gray mark was shown instead of two blue marks.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he added.
They steal $26,750 while charging a cashier at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
In the press release, investigating officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a cashier at the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's clerk" and stole a bag of money that he had to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects leave the scene, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identities, contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has long been known by the nickname Ye, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons," according to the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said that same year while talking about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, it’s us, it’s us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the one, the only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of the evil, of the confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also managed to put and remove the script and use capital letters.
AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians again as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students approaches.
López Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would “no longer use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly aid to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in AI.
According to Kai-Fu Lee, a former employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even if the U.S. lacks a formal strategy on AI.
Meanwhile, China had unveiled its plan the previous year: it aims to be No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Duplicating the research budget on AI would be a good start, given that other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the odds that the next AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-scoring American Othello player and subsequently served as an executive at Microsoft Research of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology competitions as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government scholarships, Lee says.
“It’s not China that’s taking the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired college geniuses to work in AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think they should offer residency cards to AI doctors,” he said.
The State Council of China published its Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China offers funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Center that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in motion for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country’s name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would settle a decades-long dispute with Greece and have blocked applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Advocates of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to gain admission to entities such as the EU or NATO from Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
“Today I saw vote for the future of the country, for Macedonia’s youth, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would abide by the outcome of the vote and make it final.
The change from nine would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission stated that at 1 p.m. no irregularities had been registered.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of registered voters deposited their vote.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the country's name change that would pave the way for its accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up for those who had boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads up and not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below the required.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma indicated that 57 percent of those polled planned to go to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May.
See: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses the entire defense of Brighton and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took charge of Brighton's 2-0 defence of Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy to score the goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a pass in midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He threw off one defender before overtaking several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first touch on the area to return the ball to Aguero, who struck Brighton guard Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero is going through some problems on the foot," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We’re talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky to have scored at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depth of Brighton's field in that play.
He sent a beautiful hollow pass on the right side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several taps before driving Sterling to the opposing pole.
The Blues put the ball in the goal before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to give the Rockies a party
With the Nationals out of the knockout fight, there weren't many reasons to force another title.
But an ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still knockout implications for the Rockies, who take a game advantage to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the national league's Western Division.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard position with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but continue to try to close their first division title.
“Although we didn’t play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be probably playing at the highest level I’ve played this year.
“Why don’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the starter on Sunday, but they are apparently inclined to have Scherzer be the one to pitch in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his 34th start, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will likely pitch on Sunday on his usual rest day.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the Supreme Court-elect Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the outcome in the midterm elections.
“We’ve done everything we’ve done in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I don’t compete, but I do, and that’s why I go everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using any necessary means, wickedness, and pettiness.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, over who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control and we’re never going to give it to them.”
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder.”
“And they’ve seen that for the past four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, leaning, disgusting, and lying.”
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee by quoting Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, which received strong public hype.
“Remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm... uh, what?
No, umm, no, wait... it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open.
He is not tolerant of those who express his opinion.
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, the truth is that I was not too surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs who are not well received, and all to say our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way because she resolutely confronted anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, casually issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday’s Nottingham East Labour meeting stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, the Friday night committee meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "kinder and gentler" policy was long forgotten, if ever started.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and judges itself on whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues with whom he believed he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to portray me and adopt positions with which he would never agree, either on national security or on the EU single market.
When I speak publicly, and it doesn’t really matter what I say, there is a tremendous uproar and attacks on social media censoring the center politics, telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour party.
And it doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how insult levels have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every move of "non-trust" or every change in the rules of selection, the match becomes more narrow-minded.
Over the past few years I’ve received a lot of advice that urges me to keep my head down, not to be so frank and that then “everything would be fine for me”.
I didn’t go into politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago while still in school, led by the negligence of the Thatcher government that had literally dropped my classroom, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and as a minister of government.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused by my political stances and that I do not agree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who promoted Friday’s motion, the only thing I would say is that as the country walks towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the party.
But, in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether or not they are members of the party: I am proud to serve them, and I promise that no threat or political expediency will deter me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr takes the lead
It is possible that the last two attempts altered the final result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this pleasant match of the Premier League of Tenent.
Now they lead the table and are the only undefeated team out of the ten.
Eventually it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, that led the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we have been tested in our matches and we are undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "You have to admit that Ayr took advantage of the opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute rehearsal, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers and Jason Baggot picked up a wrong pitch.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr with a penalty, before he, just in halftime, turned a solo shot, leaving the score 17-5 in favor of Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher and, from the restart, Ayr advanced further through a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with a Bruce Colvine rehearsal that was not consumed, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for scoring Climo when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson scored a practice from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he has done almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the pitch in the David Armstrong area and sent it to third-liner Gregor Henry to get the home team's fifth rehearsal.
The protagonist of Still Game begins a new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the catering industry after it is discovered that he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the definitive, and it seems Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a source in the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': interior Bolivia expects court to lead way to Pacific
The sailors watched over a naval headquarters covered with aircraft in La Paz.
Public buildings display a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are flooded with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
"Recovering it is a duty."
In sealess Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict remains alive, as does the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the IJC ruling on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate the concession to Bolivia of a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia the reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ICC ruling comes just six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," says Chilean international law expert Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have been delayed.
“The issue of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill that remained in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken an unusually swift decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile,” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using this issue for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong said his country would not pursue nuclear disarmament if it could not trust Washington.
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is “a utopia” that the continued US sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War succeed in bending the North.
In Washington they are reluctant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your hat collection or cover yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the runway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that amazed the public with the purest style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers brought their most amazing creations to the runway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide flap imitating feathers that flooded the models' heads.
Among other oversized accessories were watermelons, a magician's hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks...just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than couture.
One of the creations looked like a complete dive gear, with glasses and tube, and others a cone of melted ice.
If you’re a big fan of fashion, you’re in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the giant hats could reach the stores.
The disproportionate hats come right after the “Bomba”, the straw hat with a 60-centimeter flap that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that is behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought to the catwalk another great creation: a straw beach bag almost as large as the model dressed in a swimsuit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight piece of Jacquemus' La Riviera's spring summer 2019 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope the big hats and beach bags hit stores next summer, as the designer had such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scottish private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose, and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it hits him in the head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the results of this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest pass rates in private schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved an outstanding mark.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained honorary tuition in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding mark.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now taking the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and all kinds of programs.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Training in 2014 found that a lack of language skills accounts for 17% of the reasons why employers find it difficult to fill vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in a language for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those in developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the languages of instruction differ according to the school.
Some schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others opt for languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of their children, private schools always have several languages to choose from and teachers are specialists in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future holds.
We cannot deny that at this time, in a global business environment, that languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron debuts with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Team coach Like Walton has announced that James will play the opening game of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It remains to be decided how many minutes to play.
“It’s going to be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season.
At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season matches to be ready,” he said.
Trump's Elections Arrive in Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump’s five planned rallies next week, including stops in cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote paused for his candidate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump intends to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia to follow via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will likely address the issue of this week’s trial of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become strained over allegations of sexual misconduct and is holding a Senate confirmation vote for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November election with a new impetus.
Therefore, these five rallies that Trump will give next week aim to “energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible ahead of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could bring together supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, the latest in the polls.
“It’s not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come and support him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday’s individual matches
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating impulse pendulum is a completely invented sports concept but in which athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I guess we took that as a bit of momentum,” Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a bit of a wind in their favor and a lot to be encouraged about, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each has three points of four.
Spieth proved lethal from the tee to the green and is preaching with example.
Those guttural screams got louder as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points down after two.
In getting the putt that made them win the game in the 15th, he threw a similar scream, the kind of scream that says he believes the American team isn't out yet.
“You just have to focus and worry about your game,” Spieth said.
It’s the only thing left for these players.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple are four out of four and can’t be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they were also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That run, and the way its energy seems to flow to and from the crowd, confirms them as rivals hit on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to get a win when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Speaking of Europe is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first course ended up with the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close by the interactions between couples, the tips they give, the ones they don’t and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA has the endurance to fight, something that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulty climbing four points to the scoreboard at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, looking to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but could not cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they matched perfectly to defeat a swollen Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without grief or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and five in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning fourballs, reunited with his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes in a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They took a 2&1 win over the Spaniard John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and re-winned Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There have only been two times in Ryder Cup history where a team has come up with four points in the singles, although as the current holder of the trophy, Furyk's team only needs to tie to retain it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a Sunday counterattack seems out of his reach.
North Korea Says No to Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were increasing its mistrust of the United States and that the country would not surrender its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important steps to show its goodwill” last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test camps and committing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response from the U.S.," he added.
"Without confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will not be unilateral disarmament first on our part."
While Ri resumed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to “denuclearize” the Korean peninsula while Trump ensured North Korea’s security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first depose its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal of coercion, and even opposes the ‘declaration of an end to war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream for those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the other part of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to a standstill.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly it was inevitable to strike the United States with North Korean missiles after “evil president” Trump called Kim “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in taking disarmament measures, but said there is still much work to be done and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said there was no deadline for this, and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three or five months.”
China and Russia are discussing whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “compliance with the Security Council’s sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe full, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, just hours after North Korea denounced him for making "mafia-like demands".
At a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea vowed to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “corresponding measures.”
He noted that Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he requested were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more in order to combat the growth of the macho culture of studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
One academic found that students at the world’s number one university often don’t know the basics about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Muller Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you only telling me this now, in my senior year?’
He said no one had talked to him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basics about how acquiring good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to run the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
An hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficiency affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know this information, in the same way that we have a right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of the pride of staying up all night still exists, he says, and he adds that modern technology and the growing pressure for students that involved lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep and have a good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he points out. Even avoiding getting fat, since lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which makes him constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to go to bed, as well as for when they wake up. Likewise, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's team intended to record their first home win since the 4–1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left his team eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a low-inspiration Rangers lineup never gave the impression that he was going to tie.
While the Rangers descended to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and are only behind the Hibernian with a goal difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to deal with a head injury after the supposed launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that smashed Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same Livingston 11 who scored a point for the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way their organized set suffocated their opponents at all times.
It is possible that the Rangers dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's short first-half pass sent Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered this great opportunity.
A powerful free kick from Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense mate, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him to the second stick.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their playing in the offensive area.
Alfredo Morelos undoubtedly felt they should have kicked a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only fired two shots at the door in the first half, but Ibrox's former guard Liam Kelly barely had problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening in the 34th minute could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher snapped the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for a single finish.
Gerrard acted on the break by swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the left-hander made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor rose perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty when entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye again.
Almanaque: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and COUNTED... was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, Counter Geiger has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When these headphones are put on, the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals can be heard."
Evans: "Say, I'm sure it's snapping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Defective Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Defective Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer and re-inject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the lab so that they can "see" a protein common to several types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Berzofsky said.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump speech while wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
The result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was beaten at the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Sometimes I talk to a white man and he says, ‘How can Trump like him if he’s racist?’
If I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual assault lawsuits brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded West's critical footage to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They walked me through the backstage.
They said, “Don’t go out with that hat.”
I was intimidated!
And then they said I was just going to go away," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to bite?", saying that I would "wear my superman cap, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Prove it with love.”
His comments provoked anger in the audience at least twice and members of the SNL cast seemed to be embarrassed, he told Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave to the publication: "The whole studio was absolutely silent".
West had been appointed as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many perplexed with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West garnered the support of conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FACING THE MAFIA"
However, the host of an interview show, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "being who he is and that's completely wonderful".
“However, I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (either by buying their music or clothing or by supporting their ‘art’) who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like me,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the one to be officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charges for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of Magistrates on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor’s Office will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-handling role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles on screen mean that it seems that young people often have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels “quite strong” to address the issue.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. How did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that certain part of being a man?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "enough of horses and battlefields".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his meeting with his wife, Rose, to have been the best of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so in a way she provided me with my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the family estate land of Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in year-on-year terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV poses a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but they claim that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from GOP senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican Party senators on legislators’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the statements were being made by “ultra-right” websites and commentators.
"Lies, lies and more infamous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, the seat of the United States government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the posts was associated with the Waters department and disclosed information from a member of Waters' staff, Capitol Hill reported.
“This baseless allegation is totally false and a complete lie,” Waters said.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is totally false and a complete lie.”
Waters' statement prompted online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial was done with anger," Fleischer wrote.
“He doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they didn’t do, you shouldn’t get angry.
It should not be challenging.
You must not question the accuser’s motives.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to overtake Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“I’d be happy if it were true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his department had alerted "the law enforcement entities and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that we find the culprits and that they are held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team.”
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), the powerless spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in young films from a British point of view and it seems that this may apply to the return of the Johnny English parody and action comedy franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the ironic satire become about the matter of how obviously stupid we are in the new export opportunity of the nation?
Either way, Johnny English's incompetent, hoarse-eyed, rubber-faced character has renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comic creation designed for non-English-speaking film-going territories.
Naturally, it is the silly secret agent who, despite his freaking pretensions of flattering glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a bit of that type who contributed a single note on the subject of Fire chariots at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, in which chaos sowed in his wake.
There are a couple of good moments in the last release of Johnny English.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval suit of armor and the rotor blades make a brief bang against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps in, but gives the impression that humor has little force and is oddly superfluous, especially when such "serious" films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor is aimed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s extravagant misadventures are not as witty or focused as Atkinson’s silent movie jokes when he embodies the character of Bean.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker infiltrates Britain’s network of top-secret web spies and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the distress of the agent on duty, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the height of a pompous and conflicted prime minister, who already suffers a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but you can not do much with the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since all active spies have been compromised, she will have to get someone out of retirement.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives unofficial classes on how to become an undercover agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunite with his long-suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service mistakes return to action, bumping into Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous falcatrues: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; they create a riot that places them illegally aboard the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize himself with the interior of the house of Volta.
Evidently, all arrests come out of this last sequence, but in the kind and scandalous way that it is, it seems taken from a children's television program.
The result is quite regular.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help thinking: Can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to her talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they charge for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but pay for five.
Allegedly, the party wants employers to pass on the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by offering them an extra day off.
The employees would then enjoy a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would “adjust” to the party’s economic agenda and its plans to tip the country in favor of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four-day-a-week shifts as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party’s approach to balancing the pro-worker economy, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party does not currently support the ambition in its entirety.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week does not enter into the party’s politics and is not being considered by the party.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week’s Labour Party conference to bolster his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also involve the possibility that current shareholders of the water companies will not recover their entire investment, as a Labour government could make “deductions” because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector companies’ shares to employees, who pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed by at least a week the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question arises as to whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw his support.
On Sunday, in an interview broadcast, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I'd go to the hearing. I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the prosecution came out and asked him if he had done so.
He was firm, determined, resolute.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be immovable.
“My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is decided and I would make an explosive indictment,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know this: Brett has denied it outright," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people you mentioned couldn’t verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive poster of stars who will perform and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people march to the Great Lawn arena in Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the attending audience had to complete a number of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the Global Citizen 12 years after achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to call for action or is it just another case of so-called “cliticism,” people who think it makes a difference when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its followers, driving a set of different goals.
It claims that these actions have helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to influence the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor-executive society that has pledged to “help children develop to their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to history,” said Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition’s ambassador, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve mothers and children’s nutrition in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as with the great anti-apartheid and civil rights movements that precede us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to carry out a “blockade” to hinder Russia’s energy exports, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior announced
“In case it is necessary,” Washington can resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s engagement in Syria, especially where it operates at the behest of legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy in the same way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
In addition, according to the official, they have the ways and means to cope with it.
“The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies for dealing with Russia and Iran, taking into account that, in practice, they are the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to harness and replace fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia saying it “has only one tactic” with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace that of Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was established to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after the meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US stance got the reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” BDI chairman Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her candidacy for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully examine her presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” she said.
“After November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters do not believe he will run in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "likely" voters said the senator would not run for office, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk's Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats in connection with a possible run in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Quotes Track Palin’s Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) at Donald Trump’s No-Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans, "return different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what militia comrades and aviators, as well as other members of the army, have offered the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal in connection with a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court-friendly report in Washington to support an asylum seeker who defies policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff of the lawsuit of Sessions de Grace v. that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
Detiverona in Texas.
Lawyers from the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers for the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be adjudicated according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and said prohibition violates that principle,” the court’s friendly report said.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants harms the American economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they “provide labor”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence by criminal organizations.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby at the evacuation center in the downed city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, collecting their drowned belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued and strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake rocked the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was on a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife ask for help and then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Exercising Abuse with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in a US newspaper proclaiming the benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, referred to the payment supplement China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the US Congressional elections, which will be held on November 6, a fact that China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials coined in Reuters as a new phase of Washington’s growing campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to post advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in a growing trade war witnessing the levelling of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the US, China’s countervailing tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
In an opinion piece written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, it was stated that China "is intensifying this harassment campaign by spreading propaganda ads in the free American press."
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America’s cherished tradition of free speech and press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, at the newspaper stand at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese may have on China’s worrisome economic trajectory, given that the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He said "one of China's most important newspapers declined to publish" his article, although he did not confirm which newspaper it was.
Kavanaugh's Disaster Loses Women's Republican Vote in Half-term Elections
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, despite different sexual assault allegations, analysts warn of a violent backlash, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Reactions to these allegations were numerous and most Republicans positioned themselves to move forward with the vote.
“These things can’t be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last minute for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the moods of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, in the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, opponents of the "November Is Coming" flu protested in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, with control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will exceed any expectation,” Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
“He is already tall.
But it will be even more so, especially among the indecisive women voters from the neighborhoods outside or those who are between 18 and 29 years old, who although they do not like the President, do not usually go to the polls.
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent backlash if Republicans proceeded with confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
"This goes beyond the committee's vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench or not. The problem is how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats vote on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided between whether to believe the testimony of Ford or that of Kavanaugh, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents fully or probably believe Ford’s testimony, compared to 35% who support Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is most likely lying during his testimony, compared to 30% who think the same of Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations filed by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her intoxicated when she was 17.
On the contrary, Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court candidate showed her the genitals at a college party when she was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based on Solid, the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intention was to "take over the world".
“We have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or POD.
You can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company describes this as “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company contributes appropriate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers from around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook or Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would modify their business models overnight.
“We don’t need your permission.”
In a paper published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
A tribute to Bernard Vann, a clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergyman in the Church of England to be decorated with the Victoria Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were tasked with discovering a memorial in his honor at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the feat of his grandfather who earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the yoke of intense machine gun fire".
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and, with "great bravery", steered the line forward before rushing with a cannon and no one's help, and shooting down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something he could never live with, but a lesson still.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which led the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero is demonstrated by the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig Cuts MMA Fans at Best Time
Imagine that you take the whole night awake to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when the best part comes something prevents you.
The San Jose Cartel included 13 fights, six of them major, and was broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to see their faces, viewers in the UK were baffled when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some weren’t impressed after spending so many hours waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these children's drawings on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste".
“State regulations govern that content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., so it had to be switched to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, said in a statement.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that they will take UK viewers into account in future programming.
“I think we can fix it when we think about repetition,” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. there, we can’t fix it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
We are working to find a solution.
When the change occurred I started to receive many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical error.
No, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We'll limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six. We wanted to give our fans the maximum, but we got over it and
It gives me a lot of anger.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, claims that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he got to high school.
Invited to the first broadcast of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this show, is on sick leave.
As a guest on the first show led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that you liked boys and girls".
“To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what has driven me and given me the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to show that he was "someone" so that people would not be disappointed to discover his sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at Australia's Commonwealth Games to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was quite a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them has never been a problem.
“When you live so long in so little time” (at just 14 years old he first participated in an Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone your age who’d experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth caused Daley to completely change his perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But now I know there are things that are much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie.”
Her son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son for were tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him I wouldn’t be here to occupy that front row,” Daley said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that precise moment, at the moment of his death, that I realized that he was not really invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
The choice of Heather Small's song Proud is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied her during her preparation for the Olympics and still puts her hair to the tip.

A Mickelson in low form ended up on the Ryder Cup bench this Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must improve his technique so that it does not become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participated in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk's decision and was unable to participate in Saturday's fourballs or foursomes.
Instead of being the center of the action, as so many other times for America, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his moves.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the peak of his career, at the age of 48 he does not fit on the tight Le Golf National course, where high grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And as if that wasn't enough, Mickelson faces in Sunday's ninth game precise British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start off on the right foot, Mickelson’s performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his husband, though he could not say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role he was playing today, slapped me on the shoulder, passed my arm and told me I’d be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He had complete confidence in himself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams last and this week.
I didn’t think I’d play two games.
I thought I’d play more, but in the end that’s how things are and that’s how we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, I want to be there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup games ever played.
He could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a race that never reached the level of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangibles to the team.
“He’s a funny, sarcastic person, he’s witty and he likes to mess with people, he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he said.
"I like to see how well the youngest players have had with him this week.
It’s a lot more with a good player.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable lead in the last singles day of the Ryder Cup can easily become an awkward journey.
The Grand Dane debuted in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended up reaching the finish line with a minimum lead winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You still think that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; same as in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won by little," reflects Bjorn, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for all of them.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are in the scoreboard.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I will not tire of saying it, I am focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I am also very aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world.
Delighted with his players' performance on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we will face the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of the individual performances, and we also have to prove our worth.
It’s great to be with a partner next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you put your golfing skills to the test to the maximum.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, that they get the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he too must get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than his teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those last day turns, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but ending up as a loser after the European miracle at Medinah.
"I remember every one of the damn words," he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players for the final day.
“We have 12 important matches, but you would like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the momentum going in one direction, there’s a lot of pressure in those intermediate games.
We prepared our alignment with this in mind and put the players as we saw fit, we want to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
"I decided on this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn said of his selection for the singles.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The German Navy’s newest frigate should have been delivered in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it won’t arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and the increasing cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesperson for Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will feature a powerful cannon, with different anti-aerial and anti-ship missiles, as well as concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy younger frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and which will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be outdated when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but German media spoke of "crucial defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
Software flaws were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half the personnel needed on the former Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to have dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as the ships of similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total price of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has already reached the amazing amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the younger frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is making water.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships fit to deploy.
The officer claims that this problem is growing, as the old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
A new research that is being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bat Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to keep track of bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be created to create a detailed landscape-scale image of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating grasslands and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do traps with glue for flies, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out surveys periodically, inspections of children and, sometimes, even rescues.
The organization even has Scotland's only and first bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, Estate Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
“In Threave we have a great area for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats yet, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on the properties, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest can kill up to 400 females and young, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them, as well as destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"There's still a lot to learn about bats, and in the case of many of the species, we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo dismisses rape lawsuits and his lawyers prepare to sue German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the rape allegations against him false, claiming that the only thing people want is to make themselves known using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these allegations.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
The footballer allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to not say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after its publication, Ronaldo, 33, labeled the news fake in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
“No, not a thousand times.
What was said today is false,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“People want to be known by my name.
It's normal.
If you want to be famous just by saying my name, it’s part of my job.
I’m a happy and respectable man,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they describe as "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the area of privacy" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights infringements of recent years".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, kneeled down saying that he was 99% a gentleman, but that 1% had betrayed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had had sexual intercourse consented to by both parties.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt terrified by the reprisals and was concerned about the public mockery.
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to revoke the agreement while continuing to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Automakers to leave the UK
The United Kingdom would forever regret the loss of its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was worrying that Toyota UK had stated on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need to make a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that in the event that Brexit did not reach any agreement, the impact of delays at the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses of how production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s general manager at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is very tight, with parts from UK and EU suppliers arriving every 37 minutes for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and delays and shortages of parts could result.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid such border controls."
"It is essential to have an agreement. And we want it to be the best agreement, to enjoy the current success but also to make the most of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains.”
Toyota could not estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant's competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Burnaston’s 24-year employee and Unite union coordinator, said its members are increasingly concerned: “From experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said they had presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House said the high-risk meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant Secretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed by another week due to the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Russia’s aides and Trump, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is still no set date, it could be this week or be a week late, given everything that is going on in the supreme court.
We’ll see, but you know I like the press to be informed.”
Some journalists have questioned this claim, as Sanders has not held a press conference since September 10.
When the host Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders stated that the lack of briefing was not due to an aversion to the grandiloquence of reporters, although he added that she would not be the one to deny that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president gives more interviews than the previous president,” he said, though he did not cite any source to back up the data.
Sanders said: “If the press has the opportunity to ask directly the president of the United States, that’s far better than asking her questions.
You are witnessing how we have been doing this over the past few weeks, and that will replace a press conference where you can speak directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, press conferences alone are scarce.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a free and sometimes odd appearance before the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Secretary of Health to calm the spirits before Brexit
The Health Secretariat has addressed a letter to EU workers at Scotland’s NHS in which it expresses the country’s gratitude and communicates its desire for them to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a letter less than six months after the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has committed to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal situation.
This is a time of worry for everyone.
This is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the members of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Companions from the European Union and beyond bring unquestionable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores (31-27), Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State coach, told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he fainted when he reached the band line.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a stretcher for a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician informed Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He added that there are no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in a red shirt, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five innings in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised his total of the season to 18.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The stamp tax increase will apply to those people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on high-income people.
The stamp tax increase will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will be used to support the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases to rent, may be up to 3%.
The company expects the change to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-residents in the UK, which is driving up prices and making it harder for people who want to buy a home for the first time to access the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson applied for a cut in the property transmission tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping housing prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate percentages of tax revenues on moderate-priced homes to fix the “shame of the housing sector” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing-related reform proposals, including the control of rents and a ban on eviction where the tenant is not at fault.
It also wants to give the city councils greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
To do this, we need to fix the housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as easy for those people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy homes than for working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity of not having a roof remains too real.”
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northwestern club, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in the B team, and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden many times with my dad when I was a kid, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's head coach included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic states that he has not felt any concern about succeeding such consolidated figures in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Will success for me now depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly typical of a Premier League club," he said.
"It's not going to be an easy task to come by, but it's likely that I will only consider that I have achieved success here if I can return the club to the Premier League."
Ross has only spent three years as a coach after a period as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint as a coach at Hearts.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and managed to get St Mirren from being on the verge of descending to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to be more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a real crossroads," he recalled, about taking over Alloa.
“I really thought training was perfect for me, even more so than playing.
It sounds weird because I didn’t feel bad, I earned a reasonably good living and enjoyed some successes.
Playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and pressure from work, but I like training.
I’ve always loved training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heatwave increased consumption in more difficult British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw growth of 2.7 percent during July, but consumption in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent according to figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA commercial advisory board in charge of compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and the longer-than-expected stay of England in the World Cup caused a pattern similar to that of June to show in July, in which pubs enjoyed a 2.8 percent increase in consumption, although restaurants suffered even greater punishment.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant turnover during June worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specialized in drinks were the ones that obtained the best results with increases in consumption superior to the reductions experienced by the restaurants.
Pubs specializing in meals also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It’s like people just want to go out and drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, drink consumption increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and meal consumption decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, an employee of RSM’s leisure and hospitality analysis company, said: “These results represent a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a drop of 4.8 percent annually will be especially painful if added to this is the continued increase in costs.
The warm, long summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering business and the time will tell if the moderation of temperatures experienced during August will provide the much-needed respite for the sector.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Indicator for the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined profit of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is considered the industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "fake insta"
This news has caused an increase in the fear that sexual content will be published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "fake insta" accounts (in reference to the social photo-sharing network Instagram).
This has led to a growing fear that sexual content will be published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a softened “main” account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found a teenage girl who asked to be “raped.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that there are so many teenagers tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish athletics federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish athletics federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, in the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from its inclusion on the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very much looking forward to being the spokesperson for the athletes and I look forward to contributing and helping to drive the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games from a total of four Olympic gold medals and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what degree.
It was an exhausting job, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
“Thank you for your messages of encouragement.”
An advertisement of a breast milk extractor comparing women to cows divides public opinion on the networks
A breast milk extractor company has divided public opinion in the networks with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows that are being milked.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed “world’s first silent portable breastmilk extractor,” Elvie published an ironic ad in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom the new breastmilk extractor offers mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ugly cows to the rhythm of a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I move myself, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you didn't notice, they're not ugly, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Muxe, muxe, I’m feeding the babies, muxe, muxe, I’m milking my friends.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that this manifests the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, but in their case we stole their children days after giving birth.”
The Elvie milk extractor can be discreetly placed inside a maternal fastener (Elvie/mother)
Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why aren’t they used to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who stay with their babies?”
Another spectator added the following: “What an announcement with so little tact.”
Other viewers defended the ad, even one woman said the song seemed "very funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
Taking out my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit silly, but I interpreted it as a joke.
“It’s a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who draw their milk (often in their workplaces or in bathrooms) and feel like "cows".
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they have been dancing with the discreet pullers inserted into their fasteners.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who draw their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be discreetly fitted into a maternal bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallelism between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it entails while demonstrating in an entertaining way and close to the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This is not the first time that the Elvie extractor has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Walk Silently to a Camp on the Texas Border
The number of immigrant children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration making it difficult to allocate godparents for the children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“About 80% of people who are godparents or who are part of their household are in the country illegally, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
So we will continue to persecute those individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In order to prosecute children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require any of them to appear in court before one month after their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear by videoconferencing instead of in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be promptly deported.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape, according to shelter workers and system reports published over the past few months.
The lawyers said that these fears increase in larger centers such as the one in Tornillo, where there is a greater chance that the symptoms that a child is having a bad time go unnoticed due to its size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue "to fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "of all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem declared that the right conditions were in place for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "spread of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
“We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military actions would target jihadists, including soldiers from the al-Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra front, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for ensuring the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the body's work should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting, impeachment and scandals prematurely end his presidency.
It would be “the most dramatic end of a presidency.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, an increase of 1.7 million from four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the ratings of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the nights of major news.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” which is about a secretary of cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
It reminds me of a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
“He said, ‘Because you make me laugh,’” Mrs. Scovell said.
There is entertainment within the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the plots that emerge from Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it means something that goes beyond being an informed citizen to spend six hours watching a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward’s use of “anonymous” sources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skinned bomber jacket (“a lord garment full of arrogance over Trump’s arrogance,” said the Washington Post) and the implications of it.
I’m not going to look at Super Mario the same way.
“Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it’s giving you something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” a space that discusses the changes in characters and daily plot twists of Trump’s show (the N.F.L. conflict, praise for Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll be left behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back then and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Foreign money comes to mores to finance the candidacies to the House for the elections of the half of the legislature
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is receiving a large influx of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives in the race to occupy the same position.
This newly reorganized district on the outskirts of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who secured his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb stands against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping the new 17th District.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans had manipulated the constituency of the old districts in their favor.
The election race in the new 17th Congressional District unleashed a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after achieving a narrow victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which enjoyed wide following.
That post was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States valued the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support for China and then backed down.
Diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to order the return of the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama “for recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman in a statement made earlier this month.
However, only the possibility of imposing sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was disputed.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed holding a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the emigration of people to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, a symptom of the importance the administration attaches to it, diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new messages or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations as long as participants remained anonymous.
His accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak as long as his anonymity was preserved.
Studying History
The next negative case could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the case of possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s justice, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public archive.
Mr Mueller is also conducting his investigation to find out whether Mr Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to report to that body, just when he has to prepare for the election, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
There are many unknowns and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable, as is that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were determined to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy is accelerated or reversed.
Americans are facing several of these turning points at this time.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been carrying water to the neck ever since this newspaper reported that, last year, it suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for office.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that the Times information is not true.
“How are we going to respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial, or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-legislature elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which was the headquarters of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later he sent me to hang Shabbat candles on that table that included a swastika.

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal that same month, would place them in a very favorable position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for more important things.
“It was a good point for us, as Villarreal are a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game believing we could get something positive and we got a point.
We had a chance to win in the end, but in general, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were better.
Thursday is going to be another big European night.
We hope to be able to achieve the three points, but it will be difficult, because they got a good result in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we can fight to get a positive result.
“Last year was tough amidst everything that happened to my injuries and the changes made to the team, but there is an excellent atmosphere at the moment.
The team is good, the guys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the last season and succeed.”
Women are concerned about savings for their retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this Nationwide study said they commented with their partners on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about the issue.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they’re not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance department.
You can start with the next one.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not communicate your wishes to them well in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and family to agree on where and how to receive care, as those decisions can be a determining factor when determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you are not able to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of signing a power of attorney to manage your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your older father or mother has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down this information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.
“Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who attend to it?” asked Martin.

Man shot with air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after going out at night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m. (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not serious and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, killed at least 384 people, a figure expected to continue to rise.
Due to communications cut off, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closest to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake's epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Below we provide some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Célebes province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that lies along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regency, an administrative region less than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Celebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Fire Belt of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered over the past few years:
2004 – A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006 – A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009 – A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya Regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people recalled the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily toppled.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of a domestic violence crime, preventing a complaint of domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, they took her phone away.
Palin remains in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, in which he pleaded "not guilty, of course" when asked, the jail said.
Palin faces three Type A misdemeanor offenses, which means she could go to jail for up to a year and receive a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Type B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome he suffers after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people.
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are unavailable, and the death toll is expected to increase as the days go by.
The earthquake occurred just off Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social networks showing the moment of the impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply a rare death penalty to suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that resulted in the death of eight people, a sentence that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing the pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and caused them serious injuries “intentionally”, according to the notification of the intent to apply for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both offenses involve the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the document of the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov for 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "remarkable planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York has not prosecuted a death penalty case for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos that he viewed on his phone according to the indictment.
He also requested to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction with life imprisonment without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be Leading Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK's Independence Party stated that politicians had to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU).
Peter Bone, a British deputy, said the UK would have “leaved the EU” if Mr Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May’s challenge to reconcile her party’s divided ranks has come to light as Tories in favour of staying in the EU join an independent anti-Brexit protest held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the commitments of her Chequers plan between attacks by Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he keep fighting to try to get a deal with Brussels despite the negative response, to force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated at the concentration of Solihull's Leave Means Leave movement that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been counted on to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been given the job, we would be out of the EU by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must aborte the Chequers plan.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We don’t fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Tories member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march, from which she told reporters: “All I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is not popular with the public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel Chequers’ plan and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs May, he added: “Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage stated at the rally that it is necessary to make politicians “feel uncomfortable” if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray the Brexit decision and here we are meeting today to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the army of people of this country who have given us victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of remaining in the EU held a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners with the Tories Against Brexit message after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in a party application at the beginning of the conference.
“This is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frictionless border, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s an absolute farce.
“The concept of a good Brexit does not exist,” he said.
Warren plans to think seriously or run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a municipal session in a town in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been the focus of speculation that it will become Trump’s successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the city council format since Trump assumed the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that it takes a woman in the post of president.”
An arrest was made related to the deadly shooting of Sims, the LSU player
Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11:00 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man who was appearing in the images.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound to the head and eventually died as a result of it,” Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2-metre youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to achieve victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who was starting from pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel pitted first and let Hamilton run with traffic in the rear of the group, something that would prove decisive.
The Mercedes pitted one lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after several wheel-to-wheel maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly free the interior at the risk of falling behind after a double defensive maneuver in the third corner.
Max Verstappen departed from the last row of the starting grid and climbed up to seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks to which he retained his tyres to be able to go faster in the final part and overtake Kimi Raikkonen in fourth position.
He finally pitted on lap 44 but could not advance any positions in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and was a true gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places,” Hamilton said.
Inadequate body language
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein in an act held on Saturday for her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an event in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that people were "miserable, disgusting, and lying."
“The only thing that could have happened and the most beautiful thing that’s been happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the outrage, when you see people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying,” she said.
“When you see these posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn’t go.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make any leaks?
Remember your answer... have you filtered the document?: "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't go.
Wait a minute.
"No," he said, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“I asked for your confidentiality and I did what you asked me to do.”
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented during Saturday night's act: "I tell you that body language was not the right one.
He may not have leaked it, but he used the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was charged with sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and disgusting, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard drew for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to come back to beat Dundee 2–1 at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous victories for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal came in the 3:35th minute thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later from Beauvillier following an assist from David Rutherford.
In a hectic early period, Sullivan re-entered the home team into the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to score the tie goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were ahead on the scoreboard before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard tied the match again with a power play goal at the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and secured victory by their team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Aircraft Passengers Can Escape Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller considered a hero after dying to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
The death toll is 800 and there are many missing after a major earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area and many people are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the violently rocking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu airport.
He remained at his post to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said it was possible that this decision would save hundreds of lives, ABC News of Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take you to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“It breaks our hearts when we find out,” he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands and the country’s disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the rubble and many of them have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
“People are robbing the mini-markets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what it is they will find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says plane crash in Micronesia has now left one missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims there is a missing person after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew left the sinking plane without incident.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working jointly with authorities, hospitals and local investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that all were stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed in the lagoon before reaching the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had crossed the airstrip.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered with very little time.
“That’s extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to advance through the water reaching their waist to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who were working near the site on dock improvement tasks also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst writes chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office on Saturday repeated the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recompose the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said she had received location data from a number of mobile phones that showed Tellis was meeting Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting her earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When these data showed that his mobile phone was meeting Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was " lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“She was wiped out of her life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be seen for sentencing by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the genre’s negative perception by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol-based group, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and the fight against social problems.
They want to get back to their roots and get combative hip hop back to being popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York City childcare worker sues a couple after a "racist" message
A New York City childcare worker is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from her mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist and likens the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, showed her anguish when she discovered that childcaregiver Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOON, OTHER BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
Upon realizing her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the caregiver who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipina according to the New York Post's announcement.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her day's work and sent home on an Uber.
Now Maurice will sue the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for which it was initially hired even if there was no contract between them.
“Look, I want to show you that these things are not done,” he told the Post on Friday, adding later, “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism by stating that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid that they could not trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent him a message that I didn’t intend to send him.
It's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it was due to a mistake?
Is your baby just born?
“Come on!”
After comparing the lawsuit to "extortion", Plasco said his wife had just given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Did you go for someone like that?”
That’s not very ethical,” added the investment banker.
While the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear as may be concluded in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to get into the skin of a person who first reads it before it's published.
It’s really fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
After claiming that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of his work being rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bitter" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom he describes as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he eventually achieved.
“He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous,” he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who got something: you’re proud even if you didn’t really do it yourself.
I think I felt Paddington’s success a bit that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone
After landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
“Nad would call regularly to say that he was very bad, that he wasn’t expected to survive.
“Then I got Nad’s call to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors had given her to keep her heart beating were slowly being consumed and leaving her body.
He had died a while before and now he was dying.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in that moment of mourning for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane along with the other passengers, without noticing the ordeal she was suffering.
“No one detected it,” he said.
My head was down and I was crying all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Postcards of grieving women to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been placing cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want anyone to feel like I do every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile would illuminate any room.”
However, he left the job before dying and was "in a very deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented, "I have continued concern that a side effect will occur."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
“Christmas Day went to the bottom (when the kids opened their gifts, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything).”
He claimed that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: "It tore the family apart.
He discarded us.
We have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), it is possible that we could get a little unity,” Mr. Flake commented on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be “erasing” due to the paralysis of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
His reluctance is due to a question of deadlines.
Five weeks to the midterm elections (November 6). If, as expected, the Republicans get bad results, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the top court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI releases the report?
The Senate currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors drops under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean defectors bound for South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said 1,127 defections occurred during the past year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people passing through the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors were finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the north and south (which technically continue to be at war) have improved significantly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed roughly to work to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility whatsoever that we will unilaterally disarm first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says she's not fit to go to the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit by nature to enter the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman ever behaved that way, they would call her hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost screaming and talking as he described his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated reputation murder" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she believed Kavanaugh's statement showed she could not access the Supreme Court because it showed she had prejudice against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh if he is confirmed in the position and if the Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
“What I have to say is this: If you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then you’re not fit to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the courtroom where you are currently,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the Patient Protection and Accessible Health Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh shied away from questions about whether certain Supreme Court decisions would be overturned.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the courtroom and even above that expect us to say, 'Look how well!'"
Women need to exercise it.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and you cannot drive it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that weird, right?”
He went on to say, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then, he continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest recollections in one of my early jobs in a male-dominated office, in which I began to weep with anger impossible to describe, was that an older woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a distant superior who had always provoked a slight fear, and drove me down the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They believe that you are sad and that they will comfort you if they come to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was picked up on an out-of-wedlock adventure on a ship called Monkey Business and removed from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," he laughed at me 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
It was called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because the campaign was advanced, he was delayed in raising funds, so he swore he would not enter the race for the presidency unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of those who supported her had contributed $1,000 to the male candidates would only contribute $250.
“What do you think, I have a discount?” he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not present a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported her, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters rather than delegates and of anger at the existing sexism) she was left speechless.
“You’d think she’d had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled of how the press reacted to her.
“You would think that Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"Cryed?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War for Beijing Can Be Positive
The initial bombings of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening and, although the war is far from over, a distancing between the countries could prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200 billion, taxing half of the items that come to the United States from China.
Beijing counterattacked each time in the same way, most recently raising tariffs from five percent to ten percent by $60 billion on U.S. goods.
China has vowed to imitate U.S. measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will mute in the short term.
To get Washington to back down, it would be necessary to yield to its demands, but to publicly bow to the United States would be much more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to start an economic crisis in the two countries is actually much more dangerous than previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is 'ready' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the refugees’ voluntary return and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the necessary conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate any help it could receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located just outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive loss to the United States in Europe and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was the one who offered the most battle during the tournament, threw the ball into the water in hole 16 of par 3, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all of his series, becoming one of only four players to score a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst-ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The top-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the European player with the most wins in the tournament, with 25.5 points.
“I don’t cry often, but today I can’t help it.
It was a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to be able to win the cup.
The important thing is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passed the testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in Sunday's singles match.
"It's amazing how proud I feel today to be able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that boy play," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
It is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, winner of 14 majors, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to stay on the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, the Europeans were in trouble.
We fight.
I took my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be a captain.
It's to take off the hat.
They were superior.”
Red tide information: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the most recent report by the Florida Wildlife and Fisheries Conservation Commission, there is a general reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the commission, increasingly uneven outcropping conditions are being observed in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which may mean that concentrations are decreasing.
The Red Tide extends approximately 210 km from the coast from the northern counties of Pinellas to the southern counties of Lee.
Concentrations can be found 16 km off the coast of Hillsboro, but in fewer places compared to last week.
The Red Tide was also found in Pasco County.
Mid-level concentrations have been reported on the coast or off the coast of Pinellas County last week, background and elevated concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background and elevated concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, background and mid-level concentrations in Charlotte County, background and elevated concentrations on or off the coast of the county.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, cases of respiratory irritation continue to occur.
No such cases have been reported in Northwest Florida over the past week.
