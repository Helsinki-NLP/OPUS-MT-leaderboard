UKIP survivors who reject those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirable.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to line up behind chronic hypochondria intolerant people who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one who's using the specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing crazies, hardly exists.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a dishwasher does not constitute evidence.
Yes, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You don’t know anything about my personal situation or identity either, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate on charges of homophobia.
Farage’s phrase surprised a lot, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to make it through.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don’t like it when the media talks about what you don’t like.
It is so rarely talked about because unlike Farage and his crazy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
In the end, the situation is as bad in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis that is coming the period of austerity will not have arranged anything.
Expecting nearly 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland, the ''TIG OF EUROPE'', was praised a few years ago.
We knew the rest!
This starts reading the article again.
There is an attempt to make people believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a "NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE" is taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients not something to '' pave '' for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 80s of the twentieth century, irlance was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal Considering a constant perimeter, without the newy countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is sure in view of recent events.
Lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the taxes actually paid by the multinationals.
If we believe a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only small and medium-sized enterprises pay the full price.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new cars (and chere) at every street corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily traffic jams since homecoming.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will catch fire soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a crash on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once patched up.
Then it would be entirely the other pilot's fault.
Did Ryanair make passengers pay extra for the additional fear they were given?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can go for it.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to the place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the base fare just have to blame themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air traffic controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your compensation dreams.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrianized, and literally crowded.
People don’t come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the Salon de la revue at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of strangers spending .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, crowded with 50% of tourists.
<0x40>AloeFalse!
The only argument that I think is admissible is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy at duty-free.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
There remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows prices to be lowered.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed, with exceptions, by employees.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs has the slightest power to reform the Labour Code.
As they shut it down.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies who wish to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal biblio is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
And this is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he tenaciously defended against fascism
the way of life he tenaciously defended against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter’s estate was, against his will, used to pay the inheritance expenses?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others not terrible.
I'm sure his estate would want his share of the cake, if you'll pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Neither do I.
But for 5 years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to the other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss a “deal” with the Nazis and he cleverly won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium, and, in the end, the whole world, can thank God for having had during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the helm and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to raise the money of the inheritance fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them collect the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A relaunch of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, infrastructure works being by definition poorly renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they reflect the real evil of the French:
Return to Principles.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either solidarily we come to his aid, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to the smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who lives on the income from his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate between those who invest for a return at the time of retirement and those who live on their annuities.
A property to rent or even two for a couple on top, it's vice
The little genius of Finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great works, but at a time of lack of great infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so no new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of degrowth arises in response to a recession that is only a savage and therefore brutal degrowth.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is crying: insulation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc.
A tax that favors high incomes and renters.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a galloping man.
Samsung's profits are undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple’s mid-September introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have appealed to buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple, and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them options, functionality and price prevail.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a “better platform.”
Is there a "better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in the interest of all of us.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it’s not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who according to one of them fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course on Parisian bobos) could tell us of which author(s) they fight ideas on gender and indicate us the works they intend to fight precisely.
Or do they just attack the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, John, I like you, and you're a smart, cultured person.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holofernes, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I do not have her vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the "background", since you refer to it, this topic does not interest me, and sincerely I do not see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
<0x40>Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holofernes does it.
Who is afraid of the world?
What are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and <0x40> give us elements of answer.
The first invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We can see how much these studies touch the most intimate in their home.
We are obviously no longer in the debate of ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
<0x40>: As a debate of ideas, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the sole exposition of their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me very rigorous.
But, as I was explaining to our umpfrontist friend, this is the whole difference between having an informed opinion and a mere opinion.
I am not sure if the nuance is understood.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I was satisfied with the "Second Sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed itself when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a bit for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud really encircled the Victoria and NSW coast, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Flash special blood moon.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey make Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it back its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with it, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne, so of course I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week with Perseid meteor showers and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think that there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne really isn’t the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds over the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a tax on this eclipse.
Anyone who watches this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like your last before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when it ends up (forcefully) disappearing?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Beautiful photo of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
There is nothing about the inequalities between the incomes of labour and capital.
Nothing about tax evasion.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hyperlink to the original documents so that we can form an opinion.
Go and see the results of the miracle revenues: in Spain, exports are at the lowest level in five years.
In Greece, the stock market is collapsing.
Yet these seem to be the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of Economy tells us that these claims are unfounded.
What happens if the Ministry of Finance makes a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who have reaped the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage when presenting the invoice to the state budget?
The next one in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
The State is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifespan of its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered unproductive, it contributes to the financing of tangible and intangible investments that guarantee future growth and therefore future revenues.
A few elements of answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
The medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these questions politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money on drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Since the Liberals want our health care system to look like the United States, you should inquire about how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame doctors, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize corporate profits and "research."
So read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the global prices of drugs present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is over-the-counter or only on prescription.
It is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalation for oncological pain, despite laws that curb it and expensive permits required.
While manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy with alternatives such as marijuana, those who come up with a version that offers good quality products in known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for the doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a person in charge of this hospital.
We can't hold patents on grass...
If social science “researchers” were doing research instead of politics and networking, we might be using their “work.”
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
To compare is to make pedagogy not research.
We can not say "the search is completed, it must be applied" and then in the same jet "we must experiment at all costs".
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why are you asking us to apply it?
Can it be explained to me how a “researcher” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator let's make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is the use of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a willingness to self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to remove sophists and ideologues from training, and to remove sophists and ideologues from training that practitioners teach to practitioners.
Reread the paragraph on internships (which is unfortunately not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of the practices in force, and that does not allow to advance the system ".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be hoped that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their place in modern teacher training.
Theorists of education must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
To give more weight to the theorists of education would be to destroy it definitively.
Your analogy is totally foul: if I would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would much less like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, David Cameron’s Conservative MP in charge of fighting copyright infringement
Why not just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If I ever start to feel guilty about violating copyright, I'll just have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement <0x3D> vol.
It is the same since they must cite their sources correctly.
Obtaining a license often costs nothing.
No, it's copyright infringement.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without the proper license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can still debate pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, but it won't become true.
This is copyright infringement.
Come on, say it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Apparently you don’t mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in homework, an almost perfect definition of what reasonable use should be, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson <0x23>1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they abandon all intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions that they have passed a click.
Maybe if they share the headphones of their mp3 walker with a buddy on the school bus, they should be evicted for breaking the law in such a way.
Oh, if we could export this resource that we are so full of, the whistleblower who says that everything is going wrong....
If it is a PS member who says so, then we must believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are of age to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continually assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down are speeches like yours.
<0x40>gus I have always worked in a private company.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the dummy bosses I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
<0x40>gus, if we compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small - What do French bosses expect to do the same??
Is the state holding hands with them?
This state they accuse of imperity?
<0x40> Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet on your part!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so harsh?
Pat, I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is confronted with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who are slumping and undermining while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
It's terrible.
But they have solutions: suppression of the Labour Code, employers’ charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their suppression!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see from where I’m from, Last hasn’t really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than transform.
That doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of them.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that.
I tried to get them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But Labour is going to get us out of trouble, isn't it?
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing stopping people in the UK from creating a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally overturned.
And there’s better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as we were told during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
So we can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Perhaps it is because the management of the Dutch is on good tracks while that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
“She was a fighting girl.”
God, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that the fact of being "beating" is a quality superior to many others, the concern for others, intelligence, listening, for example, the fact of being "beating" has nothing to do with the fact of surviving a disease: cancerous "beatings", which are nonetheless dead, I know of some levers.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, we'll start again too.
I’m not telling you that’s the condition to manage, I’m telling you it helps.
It has nothing to do with any merit.
When it comes to the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
Insinuating, even for a moment, that one can have merit in getting out of a disease or that one can demerit in not getting out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that lets go, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
Sorry to think otherwise, if, having a strong moral makes it probably easier to accept heavy treatments and prepare for them, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not refuse them out of fear..
Someone who is successful in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to rely on the "Lord" it is something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real dirt, you get stripped down to the point where you just become a zombie.
Personally I caught two, dirt, fat, and if I "fought" as these fine psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of clenching your teeth, suffering hell and taking the blows.
I believed that the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on? What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “rapidly” and then swept under the rug.
Is that the story we told back then?
The Communist turned nationalist who triggered three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left out: 1.
How could NATO bombing be legal under THE LOWEST rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed that same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, it would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The West used a smokescreen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was soon recognized by Western states that then lied end-to-end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term because he did not understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in politics at the time.
In the end, the Guardian shouldn’t call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
To my knowledge there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be “the smallest and coldest planet to feature detectable water molecules,” according to a study conducted by Dr. Framing’s team.
method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat coming.
Thank you, Passeur de science, for delighting us, often, in these experimental prowesses that are realized in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Probably by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in case of an earthquake.
Radon, for example.
A gas a priori odorless for man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments at his disposal.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely a few hours with an earthquake, especially chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on arte telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to make recognize the validity of their work that concerned the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more particularly to their modification before an earthquake.
I’m not a scientist, but their hypotheses convinced me.
Where are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this trail?
We should learn to listen to nature again.
If one examines things calmly and rigorously, one publishes it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we come across the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely in a circle.
I don't understand why anyone would think Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When we listen to the LBC program we can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and he's always trying to distract with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He could not name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just underscores how the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of crap, doesn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in “Have I Got News For You.”
Because he's a celebrity and people have been instilled in the adoration of celebrities.
The people of London voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the rating of popularity of the Tories will break the ceiling I am sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be a joke.
That's exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend, who was smarter than he was.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
Americans have had one as president.
The French really and always disinterested themselves in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the “Solomon” and the “strait of scrap” speak, as sadly as the dead who remained there.
It is understandable that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruiser, Australia, must always be there from the bottom since the battle of Savo) do not want to go back.
We actually passed in front of the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the eco-friendly side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerozene consumes to achieve the goal totally discredits the concept..
Just browse the list of sponsors than philanthropists.
An operation of com more neither to do nor to do.
The cow, it makes you want too much!!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your recital makes me revisit, identifying me a bit in the passage (I also learned to navigate with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Keep making us look back, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!

I think that the red hat that protested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Region of Brittany and the City of Brest.
More seriously it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of any kind should not devote a penny of our taxes to finance the dreams of some even as friendly adventurers as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian line-up of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they are still in the team.
Bisevac is Lyon's defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or before in the 70s and 80s and has coached many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a striker in Velez's big team, which, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also counted sizes such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the loyal teammate of Arsene Wen).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
We said he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was related to Blackburn *frisson*
Now, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, and then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not a holder.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone is not the flag of today's real Albania.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to the neighboring countries.
How can one have felt an “explosion of joy” when two towers collapse knowing that women, men and no doubt children are inside?
How??
What bothers me a little in this "testimony" is that the only fact that I have been able, even once, to spontaneously rejoice in the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to me of a personality "border line" whose "testimonies" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Probably in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to do real and apocalyptic harm to the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch of powerful.
It's great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims gnawed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
The classic Schadenfreude.
We suspected a little.
The “Christian/White/Gaulish” West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, and hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general misery, social and cultural underdevelopment of today’s Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers-that-be and the fascistic nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
As we have understood before, it must not cause the Muslims to back down.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose this is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, moist and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes out, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of about to die.
In Britain, if you’re lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, don't be so grumpy about the clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to outside germs, that can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a feverishness that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and many other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my holiday recommendations for you.
Yes, those dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child surcharges, it is the amount collected by the State that essentially comes from deciles 8 to 10.
But with regard to the number of households whose taxes have increased as a result of this measure , it is mainly Deciles 4 and 5 ( median incomes ) which are concerned according to Figure 2 .
The elimination of the half part concerning especially widows is not discussed at all in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros it is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to be fixed.
Well, we're not on straw, of course, but dreamers
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy we will not cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let’s continue like this and you’ll encourage those 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I say it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the OCI recycled to the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from raising as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money has been surpassed, money is used only to make money, that is to say, to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are one of the richest 20%.
Probably also of the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth of which part is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or else it is better to lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if you have social housing .
The utopias of the head-cutters in the Khmer Rouge happily lived.
I recently did two AirBnBs in Norway.
It's all right.
In one of the two we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face the slightest hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, store behind you, and leave.
From now on, this will be my first choice when I travel.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some kind of homeowner’s insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six o'clock too late.
I love airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky” No, it’s not true.
You're just really out of luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
On his discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly quick.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel, and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm planning on paying a down payment and a month's rent all at once but I'm a little afraid of sending <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Support the troops,” the Bu$herie sang in all tones...
Innocuous weapons.
I am sure that it will please the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to anything other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically altered by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the author’s style: “looking for weapons of mass destruction.
Well, we're in agreement.
Do you think it's time to weaken the military to strengthen education?
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if they were "made" to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And don't make us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But it is not seen since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office at the college / high school to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in short, except that the employer pays neither the computer, nor the internet connection, nor the supplies.
Besides, it's so hiding at 5pm a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the CAPES with math, come, we're waiting for you.
What do you mean you don't want to hang out with badly educated chiards whose parents spit on you calling you a cumshot?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Kurdish population can thrive better.
The Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in sales, in London, earning three times nothing and yet it was a position for which a diploma was needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 more per year and we didn’t even apply for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, do not worry if you do not find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well, or that you like to do.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I would still be paying off my student loan
I don’t like working in a company so I hope to eventually move on to either the public service or academia.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of biased career pathways such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political science, that is, what is called unemployed diplomas.
I have one of those degrees and I finished production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma but, as the above article says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting salary was lower, but we rise quickly because in the real world what counts is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate engineering studies / artistic tracks have lasted for years.
Scientists can’t solve every problem, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in a way that results.
Letters, philosophy and art are two-stage sectors?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about diplomas like media study or whatever the hidden track you've been in.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture like literature, art, etc., and who value them.
Wouldn’t a real territorial policy be better to unclog Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the bottom of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise make 80km round trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-muros and the small belt already have many means of public transport otherwise more convenient (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as they already exist in northern European cities, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by the 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They also benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for ONE bike hanging device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delano<0xC3><0xAB>....
Okay, it's not okay at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other users of public transport not respect scooters before the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that stand out are: 1/ it's hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that ride super fast and get the fuck out of the survival of the bikes 2/ it takes full of pollution in the head (the bikes are for me)
The bike paths are apartheid, it is necessary to cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in Greater Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bicycle in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% of cycling trips is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, according to what OR reports, the EELV deputies seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racketeering begins, it would be better to find out who really hides behind this massacre.
Note: This is not Russia.
I’m not sure I like the way the world evolves.
That sounds awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint had actually been filed.
In addition, they should file complaints first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for the security of the airspace, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident foreseeable?
Other planes had been shot down previously, Ukraine was launching in the area of air strikes against the rebels and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat, or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents for airlines to pay for overflight rights to the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls defending their usurping government/the ultranationalists of Western Ukraine – and wanting to demonstrate in bulk that Putin shot down MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA’s supply of weapons to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far, investigators haven't said anything like that.
Calling yourself Ricardo and being such a Beotian in eco, it's distressing!
To call yourself Polar is to lose the north is joyful.
A single question of Béotien: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can’t help but notice that those who most virulently criticize Piketty’s book haven’t read it!
It's easy to read, it took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from labor, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today is similar to that of the early 20th century before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that brought down the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumed after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual’s ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Second, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is right, it can be debated without having read the book, the main thing of which is to argue one-way in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his block summarized by the press wrong?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this one that seems to me pure fumigation.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Isn’t humanity enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age when most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere – not even in the working-class neighborhoods of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn’t where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “colored perverts”?
You should not have any “airtime” on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely outrageous.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are enrolled and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
He is, and always has been, for her to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide her own marriage.
However, he is unusual in Pakistan, since he believes that women are equal to men.
What she was saying is that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at age 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Rather disappointed by this entry in terms of season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who visibly has a bit of trouble finding her character as Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons which are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange’s show singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven’t watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I would rather have suddenly than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is certain, apart from extraordinary Jessica Lange, it is above all the risks of staging and editing that surprised me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the asepticization of today's productions.
It escapes me a little to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
No, it's just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series apart from the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too scattered despite a few excellent episodes.
I don’t see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it’s going to end like 24 hours a day.
Everybody does what they want, huh?
It’s because I say “I won’t look again” that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view, nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let’s talk about less tax hikes, please – cuts instead in state spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to sabotage spending failed.
Trigger controversy over relatively small expenditure items, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than about the change of direction that voters seem to be calling out of their wishes and throughout this time certain, in each camp, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditures.
“Debt” is assets held primarily by financial institutions in this country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem in the government appropriating a third of my income (before we even talk about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to make good use of it.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to wind turbines that are almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you come to a figure that makes the luxurious-looking figure look more ridiculous on the tax limbs.
Your first <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns <0xC2><0xA3>35,000 a year will pay around <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 would pay around <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (a fifth), etc., and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 pays around <0xC2><0xA3>70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car sticker, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken at the source before local taxes and car stickers.
I get paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But don’t pretend to believe that money is falling from the sky, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of tax are going.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for work door-to-door prove this?
Even if 20% of the unemployed do not seek, that means that 80% seek and do not find.
As I am unemployed myself, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs increases my chances.
Actually I haven't heard from Pôle Emploi in months, does that mean that the agents are more busy with control operations than really bringing in job ads?
I don't see the point.
Because it is not for the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then Pole Employment needs to be done.
How is this a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed perform their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks the users of a means of transport, a head of service or are the employees of their work, etc.
Nobody cries scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights at the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I am not an expert in law.
The signing and control takes over currently, while statutorily Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, they are the ones who pay the contributions.
Politicians and French non-employees grant themselves rights they do not actually have!
That's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance participates in the valorization of wage-labour.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In reality we need to have a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit of banning this year the Hajj in Mecca to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have been denied their visa application because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during Hajj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense but apparently those “who know” decided that you could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
Nobody's coming out.
Only health workers can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they get the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Last week alone, people were infected after having contact with people in West Africa despite having taken “all necessary precautions”.
We can stop the spread of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let's forbid them from offering to fly to those countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to spot people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be quarantined immediately.
That he succeeds in passing the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is capable of erecting as a dogma the image of God characterized by the totality of the functioning cortex of the planet.
It is still far from that conception.
It's only been 20 years since information appeared as humanity's given bonus, while religion, coming from the cerebellum, directs our actions since maybe Lucy.
What is the point of becoming yet another Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to adhere to it.
Those who criticize would not set foot in the Church anyway, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
<0x40>louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe this will reach more people...
<0x40>Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envision it pre-existed in Christ.
Hillel said, “Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is commentary: go and study!”
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "advance justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step: Incarnation and Resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain the hero who overturned moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated then converted by force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming soon.
It doesn't make up.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth <0xC2><0xA3>30.
If you’re interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Obviously not at work.
The joy tabs of the IT department block all cool sites.
Hello, is that <0xC2><0xA3>30 then 20% off, or does the <0xC2><0xA3>30 include the 20% off?
Note: The PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
I bought it on Steam, so no refunds.
It's time to buy a new video card
This is a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn’t use it myself.
Amazon <0xC2><0xA3>30 for PC, <0xC2><0xA3>35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, <0xC2><0xA3>44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll erase it from your library if they decide to crack down on people who buy it there while they're out of the area.
This is the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
Thus, was France of 1940 a “putrid earth”?
So say, this Nobel prize looks like a poisonous gift to me.
We must love the France of 40, that of the "strange defeat"?
When one sees who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature one wonders if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we do not even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano to his credit, if they don't already know him!
For your part, keep on hanging out with Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep their chances.
So let's see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hi, you ugly ones.
Since I drove one in Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me all the way here.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like the awful Superman III computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Festival.
It was boring.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people out there, there weren’t just CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a buddy's grandfather's house to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner’s chance I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope that if I reach the age of 95 I will be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you are moving a bit away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits quests for jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
It immediately reports arms trafficking.
Either we have our eyes wide open like Meddeb and Ta<0xC3><0xAF>a or Boubaker or we have our eyes wide closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you are making a monumental counter-sense: all the authorities, organizations or associations, representative, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Whoever says no word consents.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is in my view the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the destruction of French society.
If there is no doubt, I should say so.
Who does not say consent, but consent to what?
Consent to proximity to ISIS or condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, “revenge” the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the thought of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't give a damn about Scotland because they don't have a seat there.
They can do whatever they want with impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that losing Labour seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good thing in the long run for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMISE" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs hold their leaders to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's what's important.
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Waxing the 8% pumps at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on issues that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists, and it worked for her.
Yet he is still in the running for prime minister in 2015 since winning the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each drive to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "The Lives of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I’m waiting for the next post: Amazon makes YOUR book based on YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's so cheerful.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I still read pirated files, books in the public domain or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a spyware.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, it's without regret.
I am amazed at the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general public bookstore, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are undoubtedly insignificant.

It is the data published by Kobo that is, neither identifying readers nor authors.
But Kobo has all that information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of acid schizophrenic kids.
It is even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
Interestingly, some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey does not want to shoot itself in the foot, unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it is actually shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is unclear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious retaliatory warning there or whether it was simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic engagement is about Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
Reading Indian Punchline is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to detail rather than to the c**lings swayed by the mainstream media. The short article you link to is important and should be read with realistic observations/warnings coming from Iran about Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980 in mind.
Who are these “moderates” who are seriously fighting the horrific secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy is pushing the world to the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent “moderates” to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending others’ children to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one on my mind.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it “must”?
Do you realize that neither criminals nor victims have the slightest chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my friend.
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the CUP triumvirate that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I in revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a sparse place in Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the sophistry of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek contact with the real in vain.
So many clichés without arguments.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the womb of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may have simply a child desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterile heterosexual couples, too.
As for the children!
What a shame to refer to them as future psychological imbalances.
One day they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to make a living and to pay for this lady’s retirement (?)
The GPA is undoubtedly a provisional "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It's not from today.
Many women have borne and brought into the world children who were not of their husbands.
This is still the case, this is how we are made...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "merchandising" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics are not also commodification of the bodies?!
Anecdotally, farewell...
It is certainly more elegant to make a maid grow in a distant country via the internet and Pay Pal than to assume its responsibilities and or avoid the scandal in another century near your home without shouting it at that time on all the roofs! ...
These practices were not done in the name of the church!
There are not only Christians and believers who reject these practices...
However, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late 1970s in the Midlands I only saw this from afar.

But if you liked that and you listened to the music - that music today still touches you as much.
I don’t know why there are so many scornful comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they’re posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article about football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of reporting that truly reflects the reality of Northern England’s culture.
No wonder Paul Mason understood the social and political context, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it was vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can check it out if you’re in the London area in November: 99psoul will again play soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at the Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here is a little well written and well thought out article.
Your criticism really needs to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped Newsnight.

Business is becoming more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
<0x40>Jonathan: Netanyahu is not looking for peace as he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (in fact, this was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, laid them on the rock and went into the water.
An Israeli stole it from him.
The Israeli representative stood up in anger and shouted, “What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not lower their guard.
That this displeases the anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the aim sought...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And this has always been the case since politics became globalized.
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it certainly endures!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What relationship of power led to the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a balance of power today!
Do you doubt it?!!!...
Besides, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyst bilveses written not others.
This proves that you don’t understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It’s just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it’s a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of realizing that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a novice populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross their arms and to ignore the whole political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles/videos that he posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I guess) it's not enough to get involved in the political process.
I'm not saying I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think being politically active in presenting its demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are windshields that will change their minds if they really risk losing the election), but it's annoying to see all these young people's condescending responses that say taking the Jesus-doing idiotic vote is going to be better than taking it.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be nice if people debated what he actually says rather than just labeling him as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you, sir.
The vote thing was completely distorted.
The pointlessness of slipping a ballot box into an ballot box every five years annoys me deeply since my vote really counts for nothing.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MPs who are accountable locally to their voters.
Also, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his (written by others).
He is clever enough to have his own words and ideas, even if these are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label of “pseudo-chomskyist bilvesses”.
I am quite convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that’s what the Guardian could do, for Suzanne to do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the nods added to the edit!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by the mainstream media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This "sling" reveals above all in my eyes that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the meetings of history where trade historians have become a minority and where exchanges of specialists have become impoverished to the benefit of ready-to-think condensed Sciences Po type for press files.
For my part I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They develop both very rational reasonings, but this rationality rests on these scapegoats which are the keystone of their thinking.
I believe rather that for Foucault the State was indispensable as the culprit.
This is part of a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
One solves the problem of the relationship to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and / or / libertarian slope (of both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire for the eradication of the State, the first knowing how to seek the State's help for its markets) in the sense of at least State / not at all State in Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
Its thinking is built on the guilt of the state: without that guilt it does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position taken against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
Nor any support at all.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its god of that time, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet poses a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty that the mechanism of adhesion represents in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-left humanities researchers who can’t stand the fact that we don’t stick to their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows” that I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You have not had the pleasure to hear our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where in Russia was it that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I can't remember the last time I saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same of white people.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them saying violently anti-White.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians are mostly biased against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are most likely to be exploited by their employers or face high levels of crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of Australians on the Chinese and Aborigines.
It’s really weird that a stranger tells me that I can’t stand the Chinese, when I’ve met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), I haven’t kept bad memories of them, all the people are worth it and, in fact, the ones in London were very nice that’s the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise you don't remember who you meet, all the people are worth it, how to remember who was who.
Do you know what's weird?
Let you and the other Russian here talk about the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the so-called White.
How many Chinese men are with white women, by comparison?
None, because there's a good chance that the parents of these white women would physically assault them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
Yet, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
<0x40>Marabout: Sorry, but the judiciary is frankly brand right.
When it comes to the judiciary union, it only represents 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
That of the political vision of the observer as well as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It remains then the obligatory tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including the prosecutor's office, forces a distinction to be made between error and the bias of magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice were not divided between these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics that implicitly reveal that it starts from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the nuisance power conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area considered is that of the plundering* of heirs committed through scams to the procedure* by succession genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million every year while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the French notariat's quasi-impunity*.
For the understanding of their mechanism, part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the said statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, is that the judicial institution has produced, during numerous disputes between genealogist and heirs reluctant to be robbed in this way, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria an elaborate form of lying?
Totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment to scam the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, custom built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never before a normal wheelchair, with wheels and bulky tires, could not.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson might invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks epic.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog poop on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the off-road tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a handicapped with a penchant for longboarding.
There are hills here that they would like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so “you see”.
The all-terrain tricycle seems to me particularly useful.
Not all people with disabilities are poor.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to make high prices for things that they know we need.
We can’t really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately this is just a draft, it is not planned to manufacture it.
I'm glad the "long-distance" wheelchair isn't on the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive shelling of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-old children have lived their whole lives under Israeli blockade!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation also, since this blockade inflicts a “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
“Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market.”
Ah, that's not the tongue of wood, rather concrete and armed lady...
References are there to support an argument or a fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There is a black market, and it is recognized.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for any person who has a heart and moral sense.
The U.S. has a well-guarded territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (backed by who you know) excluded him!
Remember also that after lifting it, Morsi had re-established the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built upside down by the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've given it some thought.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the non-profit sharing economy.
Many are just looking for one-night stands on Couchsurfing.
So it’s getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted homeowners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this?
“What is it that she leases on?”
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The verb “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you didn't notice.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers permission to practice a commercial activity (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would still be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...
Where are you going to tie him up?
Marine Le Pen is right.
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
Increasing wealth in the hands of the wealthiest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who is defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be closed!
Capitalism is not going to get poorer.
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our food therefore our food, with the structures of care therefore our health, with our debts therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said: "my enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance".
That was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild banker as Minister of Economy, in order to better defend the interests of the banksters, the only ones responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else competing?
What do you call it? Turn your jacket down, lower your pants?
Primary and populist reaction
We don’t really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where'd you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that neither side seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee soon left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was stormy at the beginning of the day; I do not know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this point.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick Wikipedia search:
A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two battlecruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after having ceased firing, and a race-persecution began.
The Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he approached he saw that it was only a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, bent and badly damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his spotlight at the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Good Hope must have escaped and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Worried about reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.
So, if this is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had sank, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in confusion they fled to take advantage of their lead.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several voices were raised at the UMP to ask that it be inscribed in the law that an elected person definitively condemned is therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect elected officials of the left of course.
Nooon, this is a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSE A REGISTRATION AT THE WALL OF THE CONSOLS OF THE MAGISTRATES
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicards whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to amaze those who will take advantage of their immovability to hinder the actions of real politicians, who are really trying to make things happen, not the beautiful talkers whose immobility is commensurate with their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little signs "money for justice" they came from the province and did not differentiate between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing, even far-right unions targeted personalities on its side and led a juridical-media war against them.
Your affirmations are totally free.
If, currently, the right is paying for the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that fall under it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice, but all those who have been the object of his attention have not been treated with favor.
On the other hand, it must also be remembered that the union of the judiciary, which is on the left, is not the only union of magistrates and that it is a minority.
The fact that a minister is so committed to supporting the unions shows how helpful they can be.
<0x40>MCR The union you are citing may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellery, it is not a secret.
The question now arises whether the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than instructing.
<0x40>gus - You should be satisfied, SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
<0x40>Pivoine: you forget that the magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and incarcerate the all-one.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most glory-hungry asshole realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I’d be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fills stadiums around the world.
Others later sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all have competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everyone else participated in contests in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens to most of the stars who don’t participate in the contests anyway.
Few are those who, after one tube, manage to make others.
Anyway, most singers/bands can at best hope for three albums and one best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
Her celebrity comes in part from her marriage to a footballer who breathes by the mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it’s more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar thrillers who smoke weed in their father’s garage and swing three chords on an elementary school-level poem will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before even releasing an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns rather quickly to racism, because sacralistic ethnologists present these distant people as infinitely superstitious and tainted with ritual bigotry, while most of their practices are strictly equivalent to our own, daily considerations and inspired ones.
Unless you are misinterpreting it in the opposite direction.
Or, rather than say that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Mariannes and Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It's ephemeral deco to fill the void.
That's all.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the sense of sacredness still lives on.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw at the nettles interpretations not at all scientific that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative criticism of the disciplines to make us laugh a little?
Because what is true of archaeology is also true of the interpretations of other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasures are constantly discovered, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is fascinating.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have technical and scientific means so efficient that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can always be called into question by other discoveries!
We are in the midst of (and old) controversy about shamanism advanced by the prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The shamans of prehistory", especially the increased reissue of the scientific controversy, published by La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could do it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't go on with three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn’t watch a musical about it, but it would be too gay!
We could have expected that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mike.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays true, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own peril.
Rather than make fun of those childish ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go away, then.
If these childish ass jokes shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article about anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
However we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests under no circumstances those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers it would have released the safety because at the time or another vehicle (tow truck for example) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew it was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (TV right, pub, money ...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I agree with that opinion, too.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at restart a chance to beat the English who led then...
This is my blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to get all your fuckin' shit out of here.
No, just don't.
There have been a lot of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant history of the possibility of victory of one driver at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out with safety because it's the FIA.
Shade of size.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of an image allows the FIA to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner waves a green flag in the middle of the intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the commissioners clearly waved a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are more under the regime of the yellow flag.
Some comments show a bleak lack of understanding of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the regime of yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the green flag agitated.
This is the usual procedure.
The commissary post just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal pace.
Sensationalism sells the pub.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid that in the end it’s just about the money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having sex life, the advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with news that you really don’t need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
“When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear” It should be “derailing,” not “coughing.”
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “derailing”.
I wonder if all the people who are freaking out that Ebola might start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist.
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and solidly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
That made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media talks about most things with this upside down optimism.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without coming to hysteria) so that the government can make us drift when it needs it.
I think it makes perfect sense that if we have to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it itself invented.
Isn’t there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing through fear?
Congratulations on this post, and for being of this world almost 35 years later.
It must have been awful at first, given the context of the 1980s and 1990s.
I am bluffing, living with the certainty of spending there for years.....
Perfectly useless testimony.
As always when it comes to science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot be used as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
<0x40>trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatric mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony of no importance.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (<0x3D> here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of the new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
What do you base your research on, then?
About ghosts?
Do you put fantasy theories and facts on the same level (<0x3D> giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the dummy word adored by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
<0x40>Jim: There are plenty of meaningless buzzwords among psychics.
Cyrulnik gave us the “resilience” trick.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he has crafted a reliable scale of measurement to quantify this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's *not* a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
Why, then?
It was a great series and it seems that those who come out of it are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can work miracles.
But how are they going to make the kids hang?
The only solution that comes to mind is the pee-poop humor, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's series.
The kids were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's series?
The UKIP works for the Mysterons.
Keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the threads and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain of rebroadcasting the old.
The series has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years since we have one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-rate commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And in addition, the half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I’m probably a “sad” 60-year-old, but I don’t watch this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the Mosque of the Esplanades!!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all Israeli excavations under and around the Esplanade Mosque for several decades have not allowed anything to be found.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is somewhere else.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not wanted for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, stands out in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham nearly sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remind it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the 2-state plan, and has scuttled it continuously!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize His own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: “Praise be to God!”
To brag about tourism in Israel, we are often shown young nayads half-naked, languid on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what the advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
It is a pity that the Reuters photographer did not take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to enter the Temple Mount and who prefer to stone the Jewish faithful below, praying at the Lamentation Wall.
<0x40>Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is with good reason, it is not the newspaper or the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end up in tears.
The only way to end this system is through revolution.
Since the economy seems to be falling apart, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater remuneration to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of whining and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not screwed up with impunity.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case, it's sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where the social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this cannot end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it's been going on.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that’s exactly what the Investor-State Dispute Settlement Mechanism (ISDS) proposed in the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable damage this deal will have on our lives.
So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated behind your back. It's not until recently that we've started talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement
Didn’t Churchill say “blood, sweat and tears”?
These are great benefits, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the eighteenth century there were trade unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (at last, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe herself the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of a nation, having this little relic is comforting.
Even if it's more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still miss the union of married men, single men, married women, single men, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don't write French correctly, I'll syndicate.
You are warned, it will be your fault.
Protected professions with trade unions have already suffered enough for the defence of category interests, which has created a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh at the fear of risk on the part of a public servant.
One can very well imagine a system guaranteeing a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster assured.
And with the carts getting ready, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance in fact...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was alluding to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here commented...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble of the 1946 constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of enterprises.
This is absolutely essential with the emergence of information power.
And yet you opened, presumably read and then commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off review”.
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, this is Joffrey's wedding I watched, and I can tell you that some of them have been seasoned well.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (though misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, of the pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, oddly enough, the show ends with a victory from the least worst baker; no one has been like, “Boom, here’s my fucking cake now eat it and bow down to your master!”
Perhaps the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside finally had an effect on them?
In previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept out of the way.
And there’s also this idea of “playing safety, there’s always next week” that disappears last week.
I love cooking, but I can’t imagine doing that.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us great entertainment and pushes us to try new things.
Forward to GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to tinker with one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to choose, I don’t know how they could choose a winner.
In Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the somewhat dry base (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green icing on Richard's mill didn't make me want to, anyway Richard had already lost by then).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time allotted.
There is also cancer lurking, with solar wind blows.
Clearly, everything is succeeding right now.
A bad time to pass for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to "hunt" ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore fewer UVs and “cancers”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV rays.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans they have the interest to allow us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to warm ourselves (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and lets UVAs and most UVBs pass through.
Do you know that you do not have to be condescending and treat your interlocutor as a remainder when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to show pedagogy.
Not to mention that I am a habituated melanoma, UV only accelerates its development.
They do not provoke him.
Proof: Not all tanned people necessarily have melanomas.
Either, when a doctor tells you to avoid the sun and live in the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for any human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And more importantly, can we switch it to the mixer?
or switch it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested have established that everything can be folded if you apply enough strength and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those interested have established that anything can be bent if sufficient force is applied to it.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
Specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every conversation.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth folding joke I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and we can hardly see how it could return to it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm........................................
Most likely, it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed properly and is therefore stuck with the installed factory test code.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of an FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
Ah the article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the manufacturers produce in "industrial" We put forward super u but all the brands and meme the small business are concerned How to eat good, bio avac 1650<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> (average salary in france)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to put their priorities wherever they want.
Food is one of them.
Go without grudges, I kiss you
We call bobos, or rather boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from realities.
It is the total unbundling thought-reason.
They are experts in gesturing, for example claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffling, joining in this the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and trumpeting so do not be surprised to often encounter criticism about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecules are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
This is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we took an interest in environmentally friendly products.
The boboécolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the green because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look this giraffe in the face.
She is so badly made that she vaguely looks like a female nude.
Shut up, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
This is *art*.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
This is not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are realistic reproductions of dogs smoking while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is more than just representing the real.
If you’re just looking for that, a camera will do the trick.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the picture speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still room for savings: riding activities, the number of Republican guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer on active duty.
Honesty obliges us to say that France is decreasing its numbers, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local communities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
<0x40>edmond: that's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
Let all those who have had little or no contact with the military thing dare to come and say here, eyes in the eye, that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
Applying the same potion to the public service as a whole will make public finances a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why La Défense can feel a little burdened!
Yes, the savings that everyone agrees that they have to be made, it has to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls moan at the murder when it happens at home, the poor darlings.
It should be done but above all that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself with each closure of posts, maternity wards, hospitals and barracks.
Everyone is for savings, of course.
It’s odd, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn’t rejoice at savings in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It’s depressing to scroll down your Facebook feed and see that 80% of your friends have started their statuses with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they're gonna make a movie out of it.
It will surely be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus going to work and realizes only there that his skirt has gotten back into his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and grind his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle over who will have the rights?
I don’t have the “internet”.
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
Oh, my God, I have to watch this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really just demonstrated that he is at the very top of the cosmic universe that satirical journalism is!
I'm in reverse!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter for them to finally have enlightenment and discover the incredible fulgurance and insurmountable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, my God, that was really bad.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until further notice we are being confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play truffle at every meeting to save the planet.
We, citizens, decide to take matters into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted to the energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away....
Translate: Wind farms and solar farms are the Round points of tomorrow.
All financed by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear discourse.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the sector is not fully controlled, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided of course that we drastically reduce our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to the production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity from renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittency.
Replacing nuclear power with renewable wind or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am a State Doctor in Physical Sciences 1981 more I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I did not say it is you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany nothing in fact nothing you did not respond to what I said and like all right people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and inefficient means of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the water vapour greenhouse gases of less effect than the CO2 it is true recall two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes into water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a “South Asian giant”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
Not surprisingly, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a South Asian giant...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora’s box full of corruption and mafia.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Athletico de Kolkata winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to IPL cricket and now to football, how could we ever compete with our “noisy neighbors”?
The race to the low-cost launcher is paid in cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect is manifested only with too cold a helium.
So maybe we are not in a defect of design, but of implementation...
unlike arianespace which is a private company, it seems well that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay for the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more unfortunate since many media outlets are looping back only the titles of articles – and many readers are retaining only those titles.
All in all this creates a false impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project when it is only a launcher problem.
