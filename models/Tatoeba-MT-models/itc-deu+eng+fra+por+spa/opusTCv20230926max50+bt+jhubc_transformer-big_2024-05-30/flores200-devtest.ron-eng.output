At the end of 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC shopping television channel.
Ring also reached a conciliation agreement in a lawsuit with the competing security company, ADT Corporation.
Even if an experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola mortality, so far it has not been clearly demonstrated that there are adequate drugs to treat an existing infection.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicated that it had fewer benefits in preventing death than desired.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a benchmark, meaning that scientists used it as a basis and compared the other three treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee’s letter and accepts the Olympic family’s absolute need to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and the sport they play, can be better served by implementing significant changes in our organization than by withdrawing certification.
USA Gymnastics supports the conduct of an independent investigation that can shed light on how abuses of the proportions so boldly described by Larry Nassar’s abusers have been able to go unnoticed for so long, and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal – to make sports gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dream in a safe environment with positive and permissive atmosphere.

This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered with feathers, an already widespread hypothesis, but provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say the feathers of this animal were brownish-brown on the top, with a light or orange color on the bottom.
The discovery also provides insight into how bird feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed spindle, called a rachis, but show other characteristic elements of feathers — beards and chins — the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development that arose after the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for impression. The researchers have suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not chicken fluff.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the fluff of a puppy.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 people.
The governor’s office said nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected an alleged Daesh militant (ISIL) of being responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system has been shown to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
Brightness and rotation are used in combination to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in magnetic inversions.

He added that “they should not, however, be required to assume obligations that go beyond their level of development, responsibility and capabilities.”
The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
No one can guarantee at this time that any intervention in Iraq will stop sectarian war, rising violence or a slide into chaos.
The report opens with a plea for open debate and consensus-building in the United States on Middle East policy.
The report is extremely critical of almost every aspect of the current policy of the executive towards Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first of 78 recommendations he made was to launch new diplomatic action before the end of this year to secure Iraq’s borders against hostile intervention and restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces produced between the galaxy’s dark matter and the Milky Way’s dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory says that dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of aura and is composed of a lot of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
“In an interview, he said the new variant is ‘very disturbing and worrying because of the very high mortality rate.’”
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were medical staff at the hospital.
Over the course of a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire TB group appears to still be low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at one time in South Africa.

"All cave entrances, which have been called 'The Seven Sisters', have a diameter between 100 and 250 meters (328 - 820 feet)."
Infrared images show that temperature differences between night and day indicate the likelihood that they are caves.
“They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of some large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is compatible with the hypothesis that they would represent deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushind of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeological Team and the University of Northern Arizona at Flagsta.
In France, voting has traditionally been a little technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin and place in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating which candidate they have chosen.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, he leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers confirm that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except for those of duly numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send their representatives to witness at all stages of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

The UN peacekeepers, who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, are blamed for the spread of the disease, whose outbreak erupted near the troops' camp.
According to the process, the waste from the UN camp was not properly sanitized, causing bacterial contamination of the tributary of the Artibonite River, one of the largest in Haiti.
Before the arrival of the troops, Haiti had had no problems with the disease since the 1800s.

The first event he took part in was the slalom, where in the first attempt he did not reach the finish. 36 of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In the other race, the giant slalom finished tenth in the women's group with a total time of 4:41.30, with 2:11.60 minutes behind the first arrival, Australian Claudia Loesch, and with 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-placed competitor, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four seated women’s skiers failed to finish their lap, and 45 of the 117 giant slalom skiers failed to secure a place in the competition.
Police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
“Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: ‘We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop.’”
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the charges appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit her, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road he had had the accident was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She was detained pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered as her image was widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have ruled that publishing the photos can be harmful.
“Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that ‘journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about suspects.’”
The Crown Prosecutor’s Office, which is charged with prosecuting, told journalists it would not comment further until at least the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants drawn on the basis of the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims that after signing the agreement, it will have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
Hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by rangers, the test being monitored and its effectiveness subject to evaluation.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sports Hunters Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited, based on the hunting program of the Sports Hunters Association.
According to Mick O’Flynn, Executive Director for Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation benefited from comprehensive safety and training training.
Martelly took the oath yesterday before a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), made up of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth postcode in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to direct the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some that should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns in four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MECI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported another 34 overheating incidents, which the company said were “not serious.”
“The ministry responded by saying that Apple’s postponement is ‘truly regrettable.’”
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Alert Center said there were no indications of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists hostage from Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographers.
Later, photos took the place of an elderly woman who needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began in his spare time to research premature labor.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua said government investigators had recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to the Moon.
"Tommy Dreamer said that 'The moon was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. The moon died on the night with two months. A unique moment, as she was. A strong woman."."
“Dustin Runnels, dubbed ‘Golden Powder,’ commented that ‘The moon has been as eccentric as me... maybe even more... I love it and will miss it... I hope it’s in a better place.’”
Out of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that, in her view, Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
Thirty-four percent of respondents agree with this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympics was to swim at the Commonwealth Games, in the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as in three relay events, but his physical condition was questioned because of his complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to control the pain, which were forbidden during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
Several people checked the discovery before the beginning of February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the earth’s water supply, alongside organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his rule earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to travel shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on the use of satellites, unlike older ground-based radar systems, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and transmit more accurate information to pilots.
There are no additional means of transport available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and public transport-related parking and facilities are not available in the area.
Fears about the lack of means of transport brought into question the possibility of organizing the party with closed doors, in the absence of the team’s supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to the reproduction between the endemic Darwin cactus, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in a multitude of patterns. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into thin threads that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated in the form of sheets.
It can be made so thin, that sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, form a ball of them.
The moisture present on the hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewerage system.
Debris from the sewage systems was found in the houses in the mining towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used in common.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you do it through a satellite.
The space satellite receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and sight.
It takes a huge, 100-foot-high rocket to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has given us was to provide us with much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them we have several medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free pet cats) that eat much more of the numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the niche concept; each cat has its own role to fulfill, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called packs.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals with surprisingly similar behavior to lions (but not to other large cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
Completely athletic, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, make long-distance jumps, and shoot with a force five times greater than that of a strong man.
Tigers fall into the same group (genus Panthera) with lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the roar of a full lion’s voice, but rather a sentence of sharp, screaming words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents or birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) with the help of smell, sniffing the ground to find them.
Thanks to their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and can move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the environment in which they are located, then throwing themselves on the prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move over a mountain chain or river or if they move to a new island, from which they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from that in which they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we will no longer be able to say they are the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale (i.e. they expel it from the lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis. In addition, they make shade.
We make our houses from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaur was the top predator of his time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than 70 blade-sharp teeth, along with an additional set in his mouth, meaning that nothing in his path escaped well.
We don't know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue. His food included turtles, large fish, other mosasaur species, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; not even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could have handled it.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called parsley.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting in their chairs, rich men liked to have banquets where they sat on one side while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not include dishes that arrived in Europe, America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an internal sanctuary in which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were also built.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard; the shops were just the counters that went straight into the street.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so the wood was very expensive.
In the Scandinavian saga it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while traveling further west, he found Green Land and named it Greenland.
However, no matter what discoveries he made, Eskimo tribes were already living in those places at the time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in population, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watched the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a map of a treasure.
"On the back of the declaration of independence you can read the words: 'The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776.' The text appears inverted, at the bottom of the document."
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is still known that, in its early days, the large parchment document (measuring 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) had been kept rolled.
Therefore, the marking was probably made simply for labeling.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
"He was led by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked alongside the invaders instead of fighting them."
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being dubbed 'Operation Dragoon.'"
Within two weeks, American forces along with the Free French had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of great people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, i.e. civil, being related to the Latin civis, i.e. citizen, and civitas, i.e. city or city-state; it also defines in a way the size of society.
State cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilizing culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural footprint, and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations themselves.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to implement its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and states treated the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, ranked second in the world's most successful teams and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
There are nearly 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
“Because of the groups of islands that Japan has, it is often said that Japan is geographically an ‘archipelago.’”
The beginning of Taiwan came a long time ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1984–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Window.
Most buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photo format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is also produced today but, more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
The format of 35 mm, somewhat confusing, is actually 36 mm in width by 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing to twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore declared to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism, while maintaining some order in an image.
According to it, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to each other, despite differences in language and customs.
His ubiquitous power affected everyone, from the king to the common mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether the principle was really respected.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, interrupting the provision of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international law provisions, enshrined in several international agreements signed in the last two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unbridled submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with only four cents in his pocket, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former job boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different periods of time; each stage of China or each family holding power represented a distinct dynasty.
The periods between consecutive dynasties were also marked by divided provinces. The best-known interval of this kind was the Three Kingdoms Period, over the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were bitter wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, with thousands dying fighting to occupy the throne in the grand palace at Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist to a republican, nationalist system, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of class-based armed hierarchy, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things that went beyond the worldly. He used to go often to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira", located on Mount Noor (light).
The cave itself, which has survived over time, allows us to form a living picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know its existence. Once inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also called the Giza Necropolis, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the highest), several smaller tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, caves and temples were built to honor the wives and members of Khufu's family.
"The marking 'feature up' looks like a V, and the marking 'feature down' looks like a staple or square missing the bottom side."
Upwards means you have to start from the top and push the bow; downwards means you have to start from the frog (i.e. the part from which you grab the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A bow feature up usually generates a softer sound, while a down feature is stronger and more determined.
Do not hesitate to mark your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for the bow features are there for musical reasons and should normally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, four) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a mob of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and howling threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage's windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd lifted the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen's eyes.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in conquering the state of the Philippines were paid for by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to bear much of the expenses and interest associated with bonds placed on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which events unfold is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the epoch in European history spanning the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a related logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has “effects” on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of machines, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of the machines.
A large number of car owners lead to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography has shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography have emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, have been better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris is considered the fashion capital in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread around 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its status was in decline during the 12th century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silk and spices more prized than what the Byzantine markets offered.
This was the moment when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the tenth and eleventh centuries and in the fourteenth century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years old.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advances of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture made to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often ecological, system that uses preserved seeds from the same ecological region alongside crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still happening in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel pushed aside by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of members.
Characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of the characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, as a result of negligence, misery or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
"Such children are called 'untamed' or wild. Some wild children have been kidnapped by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to his or her rejection by the parents, due to severe intellectual or physical deficiencies."
Wild children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or fleeing home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffold goes a little further.
The scaffolding or construction site method is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are included in the software, having the role of interrogating, providing clues and explaining procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on his own.
Children are placed in family care for numerous reasons, ranging from negligence to abuse, even going as far as extortion.
There should not be children who grow up in an environment where they are deprived of food, love and education, but there are.
We perceive the family care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe accommodation, caring caregivers, sound education and reliable healthcare.
It is assumed that family care will cover the needs of children who were not covered in the house where they had previously been.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the other Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of addressing types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continuous relationships” were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it can be observed whether a person is lying by the correct interpretation of facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his “President’s Speech,” showed how people who can’t understand speech because of brain damage still manage to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination make that in each generation the direction of variation is dominated by one or the other of the two genetic backgrounds.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to satisfy its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were leaf proteins and legumes, but they are hard to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
Unlike these, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
“Given all this, it shouldn’t surprise us if our ancestors solved the ‘protein problem’ in a way similar to the chimpanzees in the savannah today.”
Sleep disruption is the procedure by which you intentionally wake up during your normal period of sleep to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a conscious state without fully waking up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking liquids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one’s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, to which the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga have been added.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process and culture led to the separation of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to take forty years and will be fought seriously, by “delegated” armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans became useless almost overnight, however, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army were put in motion creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other multilateral and bilateral international treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one side of the ocean to the other.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to their homes for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing grounds, usually in the care of herdsmen who were often children or adolescents, similar to well-known ewes. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
Wagonway roads have been built in England since the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks arranged in parallel, they allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and draw heavier loads than they could on the slightly more irregular roads of that time.
The rails were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place. However, gradually, it was concluded that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal strip on top.
This became a widespread practice, but iron led to faster wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans began to walk upright 2 million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning the right man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually go upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have already gone bipedal seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to some extent reduce future suffering.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not want only a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological progress, and the problems are greater now because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printery, a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 children were made, known as Dunlap posters.
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 remaining Dunlap posters are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don’t think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds can still see many dinosaur-like features.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of the two values, respectively 0 or 1, and the name of these numbers is binary digits or bits, in the jargon of computer science.
Internal poisoning may not be obvious immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication for internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of drugs or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "cockroach" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term has its origins in the ancient resemblance to bedbugs, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Both killer cockroaches and bedbugs are nests, adapted to life in the nest or the home of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which means it is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a child is neither in their interest nor in that of the child.
These couples can choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one, however, experimentation and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have mostly used classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted on all aspects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not mere responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase’s experiment was one of the most important evidence in favor of the DNA hypothesis being genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments marking either the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline-like cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism organized around nature exploration attracts people interested in visiting natural environments to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example would be visiting, photographing and learning more about Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from the small settlements in the countryside to their jobs, passing by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a private car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has dislocated the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has sustained human evolution over the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or the collapse of bridges are rarely encountered in developed countries.
Why do transport systems give rise to such discontent, why do they fail every day? Is it because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something worse happening?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult, because drivers’ behavior cannot be predicted with absolute accuracy.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to remain within reasonably constant limits; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily avoid enemies and find food and mates for mating much more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeris.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; namely that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, some six miles wide.
No less than 20 percent of the water that runs into the oceans from the planet’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, accumulating water from thousands of smaller waters.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never exceeded in size and technical skill of construction.
Ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by the majority of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known since ancient times some fundamental chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, because they can be found in nature in native state and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, issued a theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air and fire.
He reminded us rather of the four states of matter, (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he had theorized and that it transforms into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys can also include small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions could fit at the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing media emerged, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to get their hands on a sharpener.
You can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something new appears.
The fission bomb works according to the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy carriage up the hill. Breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with a small or no impulse.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The bark is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker in higher relief areas.
It may be more maria in the nearby part, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
The content theories are focused on identifying the elements that attract people’s attention or make them enjoy themselves.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with development to maturity.
These theories study what makes some people want to do what they do and what in their environment can make certain things do or not do.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's Pyramid of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead former colleagues. One extreme is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities and empowering people.
On the other side of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals who believe they have to change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to ruptures between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group to which they belong.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The “Invisible Team” is the management team to which each of the members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each of the members.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When in the functional departments of an organization all available resources are used efficiently, creativity and ingenuity can manifest freely.
As a result, the process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to get organizations to achieve higher performance.
The data in neurobiology are physical evidence that underlies a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. As such, it allows the narrowing of the research area and its definition with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the structures and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models that help us understand the processes that take place in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important part of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and adapting intelligence to machines.
AI research involves manufacturing machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, but a few software applications for personal computers and video games have also been used.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The technology offers the solution with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while in class.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the site is redesigned, and previous versions are maintained online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve the student’s written expression. While students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Since students often represent the most critical audience, the blog author begins to make efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
"Blogging also 'obliges students to be more aware of the world around them'. The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to expand their study far beyond the usual school day.
Proper use of blogs “can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of those written by others, as well as outline their own perspectives on certain issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the undefiled natural beauty of Muskoka District and more.
These and many more highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider Canadian par excellence.
Large portions further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that have the gift of surprising many: the number of African Americans living in the U.S. is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true self-contained continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her real marital status.
It is good to wear the ring, but do not look expensive.
Women must bear in mind that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and it is not unusual to be pursued, grasped, etc.
Be determined when you reject a man and don’t be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, it still doesn’t mean it’s OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans and sailors, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755, following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given by the Spanish merchants who had established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the Old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of all kinds of coins, but it’s all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the settlement's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, for visits outside the city an informational effort is required to understand at what stage the fighting is still being carried out in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for the climbing of the Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest trips in the footsteps of African mountain gorillas.
For the trip through Goma you can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) price of a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Along with its relative inaccessibility, 'Timbuktu' has come to be used metaphorically in the sense of exotic, remote places."
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates’ PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has a more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting another type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the country’s national parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It could also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a number of South African parks or all South African national parks.
The name of the Hong Kong territory is given by the island of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists regard as the central point.
The exhibition of buildings that contribute to Hong Kong’s horizon has been likened to a bright bar chart that is highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon, on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the developed urban part of Hong Kong Island is crammed on recovered land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that British settlers have seized and therefore for those looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last redoubts of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/swamp.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has become a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengali tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (over the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses connecting districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 Nu) or Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River extends over the Oyapock River to link the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two strips of 3.50 meters wide.
The free height of passage under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for circulation until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully functional in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest group of indigenous people living in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region also housed other groups of indigenous tribes, such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
"Paraguay, formerly called the 'Giant Province of the Indies', originated in the 16th century after the Spanish conquerors met its indigenous groups."
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous specificity and identity.
Argentina is renowned as having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo games, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is established as the equivalent of 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley face to face with the FIC West store.
British liras will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although they will probably receive the British and American currency; contact the owners early to find out what means of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the country, so you need to change them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo lies south of the equator, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures frequently reach above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below the freezing point, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no particularly 'rainy' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and do not need to be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meter from bears and wolves, respectively 25 yards/meter from other wildlife!
No matter how docile it may seem, the bison, dwarf, bear and almost all other large animals can attack man.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept the right distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so it is good to give them their space.
In addition, be careful that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be advisable to avoid strong-smelling foods and keep clean at the campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval confrontation of sad memory in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the murder of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is located between two ports. The most famous of these are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district), on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where you can swim safely, and most have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide palette of shops arranged along the shore.
The main local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can find many French wines, but the New Zealand or Australian ones would do better.
Local tap water is drinkable, but if you are afraid you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino comes full eyes with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. Fruit juices are peppered in price, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, observe all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April to the north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be found outside this period.
Sharks exist, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks frighten people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep your booking if you need time to think about the offer or to acquire other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you’ll have to arrive early to catch a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main scenes is over, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, pay attention to the location of the cabin, since sailing through the ice makes an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the requirement to obtain their visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent here by customers and the money spent by them. Usually there are no windows and clocks, and the exits can hardly be found.
They usually have special offers for food, drink and entertainment, to keep the good mood and guests to stay on the premises.
However, drunkenness affects judgment, and good players know how important it is to stay lucid.
Those who will drive to high latitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On frozen and snowy roads, friction is low and you can’t drive like on dry asphalt.
During the blizzard, in a very short interval, enough snow may fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or viscous snow or condensation, or the formation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Probably safaris are the main tourist attraction of Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to land trips undertaken to see the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially those in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow good viewing of them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will be able to see them better using binoculars.
“A walking safari (also called a ‘bush walk’, ‘safari hike’, or ‘on foot’) consists of hiking, either a few hours or a few days.”
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations on the territory of Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your airline tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may be faced with a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, cancellation policies for coronavirus reasons were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, with regular tickets costing around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow, even if they do not exist in the room.
If you don’t have an iron at your disposal or don’t like to wear socks, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one at hand.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters differ in their level of efficiency, and if you’re worried, consider buying water in closed bottles from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with at home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritation, or in severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person using physical force, are not generally considered harmful.
Duty-free shopping offers you the opportunity to purchase goods in certain places exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers planning to visit high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable sums, especially when it comes to products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The portion between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult traffic conditions across the entire stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often crossing through isolated and unplanned areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes and dangerous curves predominate.
The speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is all the more important to strictly adhere to them.
However, rather bizarrely, the mobile phone service is much more powerful here than along many other portions of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common, with apples being used throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, peanuts and other nuts. Often, popular cakes go very well with a cup of hard coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a food based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
“A curry can be ‘dry’ or ‘liquid’ depending on the amount of liquid.”
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without other qualifications, however, the term tends to indicate food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, the Javanese cuisine is characterized by a series of dishes seasoned with simplicity, the predominant tastes preferred by Javanese being peanuts, chili pepper, sugar (especially javanese coconut sugar) and various flavored spices.
The stairs support the rider's feet, hanging on either side of the seat.
These provide the rider with better stability, but can pose safety issues because a rider’s legs may get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from the saddle, but remains with a leg hanging from the ladder, the horse can drag him after when he runs. To minimize this risk, a number of precautionary measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear heeled riding boots and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the ladder straps to detach from the saddle if pulled back by a rider who falls from the saddle.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s most sought-after climbing spot, known as South America’s Yosemite, with a variety of walls and high granite peaks.
The summits offer breathtaking views from their summit. Climbers from all over the world continually trace new routes between walls with unlimited potential.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, which consist of sliding down the snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
“Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called ‘ski bums’ in English, who organize entire holidays around skiing in a certain place.”
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have cave paintings that represent skiers since before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called skiing in unmarked areas, touring skiing or hiking on skis.
It is a related activity, but usually does not involve alpine skiing or climbing, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrain and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you’ll be able to cover distances slightly longer than walking – but very rarely will you be able to reach typical cross-country speeds without a heavy backpack on the neat slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean going through visa and passport control procedures repeatedly.
In this sense, the Schengen area is organized in a way as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to do so at passport checkpoints.
Similarly, those with a Schengen visa do not have to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money and documents to obtain.
There is no universal definition that establishes which items produced are antiques. Some tax agencies consider antiques goods older than 100 years.
The definition varies by geographic location, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Crafts can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced objects.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of income among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many who have other trades.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population were involved in the large-scale rearing of reindeer, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as burden animals.
Today, many Sámi have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sámi area.
“Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word ‘gypsy’ is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population.”
If the country you are visiting is the subject of a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
An example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
Opinions are often presented superficially, generally and too simplified, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
“Extreme weather conditions” is a generic term used for any type of hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and are of several kinds, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as storms, tornadoes, sea thunderstorms and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to be aware of the risks of severe weather affecting the area, as it could disrupt their travel plans.
It is indicated that anyone planning to travel to a country that can be considered a war zone should have professional training.
An Internet search for “hostile environmental course” will probably provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually take between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are quite numerous, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning to undergo a sex change operation in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The opening of governments to the possibility of issuing passports that do not state the sex (X) or updated documents to match the desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies as much.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who haven’t had surgery yet shouldn’t expect to go through scans without affecting their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the flow of return to the ocean from the waves breaking on the beach, often to a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there a rapid current to deep waters can form.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in an attempt to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is not more difficult than normal.
Try to head for a position where you are not caught again, and depending on the skills you have and whether or not someone has seen you, you may want to wait to be saved.
The shock of returning home manifests itself faster than the cultural shock (it persists less from the euphoria of the honeymoon), has a longer duration and can be more severe.
Travellers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes face special difficulties in readapting to their native culture.
If you returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost yourself from the habits of your native culture.
When you had just gone abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, being aware that visiting a new country requires a process of adaptation.
The world doesn’t always expect patience and understanding to be necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the entire area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
The noise made by tourists and sellers is usually constantly heard. The sound and lights show seems to be detached from a story book.
The sphinx is used as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The southern region of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsula Mountains merge to give rise to this plateau, then separate again to form the 360-kilometre chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel Chain, lies the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m.
In isolated places, with no signal on the phone, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot take the place of a cell phone, because you have to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including recreational craft, as well as by expeditions that require remote transmission of data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider may give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular alternative for people planning a year off is to combine travel with study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before attending a university, without jeopardizing their educational progress.
In many cases, enrolling in one year of off-campus courses abroad can even increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programs.
“Finland is a wonderful place for canoeing. ‘Land of a Thousand Lakes’ also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.”
In archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boat riding is the national recreational activity of Finland, with one boat every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is from 1 to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go on land trips on board a ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009)
Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is by no means close to the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and antipathies towards other things that are manifested in so many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often delivery time is essential in terms of documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they have sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to make it pass faster was to be sent as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and here you intervene.
The obvious way to fly first class or business is to pay a big pile of money for this privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: in general, you can expect business class to pay up to four times the normal economic rate, and in first class up to eleven times more!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts for business class seats or class I seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, in which context they charge fares according to requirements.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from an inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and its own currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
The economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Christianity-Orthodoxism.
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second port after Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed and modern commercial center, located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with glass facade buildings and modern shopping centers, are equipped with traditional 18th century red tile roofs, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the church yard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves above tombs.
It is worth spending half an hour strolling through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which has become outside the country’s borders following an enthusiastic review of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north you can visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place known all over the world for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that, in principle, you visit the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who survived internment there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
You are asked to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by drawing and scratching existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the panels are made only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport, along with other services.
Periodic subway announcements are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automatic system in different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known as self-centered, rude and arrogant.
“Although it is often just a stereotype not in line with reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as well as possible, as someone who is ‘bien élevé’ (well raised). It will help you deal with it much more easily.”
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a minimum of courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and altitude levels.
The region also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare wildlife such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, laughter, wild cat and mountain rooster can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women should wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer covers for women who come unprepared, but if you bring yours, especially one in bright colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel at ease wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any spices available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always start with capital letters, even inside the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or adjective being used in a nounized form.
The pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most being pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters you need to pay more attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel after them.
Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means darling, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about the grammar of the Persian language and better understand the phrases.
Obviously, those who know a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may draw the premature conclusion that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated today and remain open as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, it is usually found in cities or on campuses, and is more easily accessible than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas that have favorable weather conditions.
The view of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen blossoms.
In Japan, the first parties dedicated to the cherry blossom were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the imperial court aristocracy.
Plants don’t look any better than in their natural environment, so don’t be tempted to pick even “only one” of them.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can orient yourself easily and buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
"But being in the 'upper tropics', just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to face both the heat (always), and the strong sun (when it's clear, less often)."
There are also several buses going north to Hebron, the place where, according to tradition, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were buried, along with their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take is going to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland navigable waters can be a good theme for organizing a holiday.
For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or take a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important celebrations of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions relating to this feast have been adopted by both non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake, outdoors, to see the sunrise.
For this tradition there are of course explanations in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening in Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the distance from the mainland, the mammals were unable to make the journey, the result being that the giant tortoise is the main animal grazing in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not, therefore, often a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars as well.
Japanese work culture has a stronger hierarchical and more formal character than that to which Westerners are accustomed.
Costumes are the standard clothing in the business environment, and co-workers address each other using the last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is an essential element, with an emphasis on group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often need to get superiors’ approval for all decisions they make, and they expect them to follow superiors’ instructions without question.
