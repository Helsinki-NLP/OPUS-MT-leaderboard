Members of the Assembly of Wales fear "passing for Hammers"
There is consternation on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) about the suggestion that its title be changed to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
Some members of this assembly, coming from all political backgrounds, fear that this will make them fall into ridicule.
A Labour MP said the group is concerned that "the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrement".
Plaid’s AM said the group as a whole was “unhappy” and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP said the group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a pronunciation similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave its assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which recorded widespread support for the proposal to designate the Assembly as the "Welsh Parliament".
On the issue of the title of the MPs, the Commission favoured "Deputies of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to gather consensus could be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of MPs and the configuration of the commission system.
When debating legislation, AMs will have the final say on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a complaint about its territory, having repeatedly objected to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no more than the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin’s bells are silent at a time when Harlem churches are fighting for survival
“In a historical perspective, the seniors I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“Today there is neither one nor the other.”
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understood.
“People socialize differently today,” he said.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly head.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of assets may not last as long as the leaders hope, and that, sooner or later, everything will return exactly to its starting point.
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuaries.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so this will hasten the day when these churches will all close, as it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later taken over by a black congregation that held its services in the immediate vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promoting black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, the parishioners of Father Johnson ordered the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the chime "the bells of the poor."
The expert who rang the chime in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved into the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather stated that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has taken place in St. Martin’s in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that it would "procure to pass on the costs", despite the fact that it was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Teen at Lobster Dive in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunting dive in California on the first day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour as he heard the boy scream for help, then rowed towards him with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but later realized the boy was yelling "I've been bitten!"
I've been bitten!
The entire area of the collarbone was torn apart, Hammel described what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper trunk.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style cosmetics sections supported by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion clothing and household items decline, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out in more stores next year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from supermarkets seeking ways to use exhibition space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty catalog with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees ranges will also gain more space with branded areas similar to those of stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products obey vegan precepts, something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and the shift from food shopping habits to small daily quantities in local stores have led to supermarkets now having to work harder to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, executive chairman of Sainsbury's, said the stores would increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also installed a number of Habitats, as it acquired both chains two years ago, and says this has boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from health-product stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 outlets to Lloyds Pharmacy for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more enjoyable environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit every need. On the other hand, the inviting environment and the practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby quit <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was “furious” after TV host Holly Willoughby abandoned an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of Truly household items and accessories.
The business of both had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was leaving the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons star Den Peter Jones livid by abandoning the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was “furious” when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting last Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) meant she would no longer have time to dedicate herself to her Truly brand of household items and accessories.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, was announcing on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his holiday homes abroad.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It would mean resolving your future in the long run and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely amazed.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There’s a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at headquarters in Marlow.”
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning hostess, who is among Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions, given the sheer investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to apparel and household items, and the potential for additional launch delays.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couples go on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we do not intend to comment on your business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
The U.S. president jokingly mentioned criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider “unworthy of a president” and for revealing such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump claimed, in his feigned voice of “newspaper pivot.”
"I didn't give in at all."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, noting that it would be a major step in North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations for denuclearisation are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the US to the first steps toward disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is pursuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
“It’s going very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the remains of U.S. military personnel.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been evicted, it was not declared a national catastrophe, a prerequisite for the channelling of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been clear that they are not asking for international aid, so it becomes a bit difficult," said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organising a team to head to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly seen on other coastlines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, despite the validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who made decrepit infrastructure improvement a centerpiece of his election campaign, has spent huge sums on roads and railroads.
However, funding shortages plagued Mr. Joko’s executive as he faces re-election next year.
The president is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes a long shot for the tie goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, with his team losing 1-0.
He taped to his left before making a shot towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed for the top right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to reach that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are advancing as much as possible, so I was just gaining as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I gave him a touch and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won 1-0 at halftime after scoring a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In that play, the blues forward gave Mateo Kovacic a heel pass back before taking off near midfield and sprinting towards Liverpool’s area.
Kovacic made a quick pass to midfield.
He then made a nice shot that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the big area.
He overcame the defenders and scored the goal against the net of the second beam with a left footed shot by Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster response agency said earlier on Sunday.
There are reports that describe a large number of people trapped in the debris of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the debris of the buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old victim was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man being detained on suspicion of murder.
The police urged the population of the area that they may have witnessed something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to everyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious being contacted.
I would also like to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images from deck cameras, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us as they may have information crucial to the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim headed to the scene to inquire about the location where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, with police saying they are now informing the victim’s close relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just attempted to access his apartment, but has been told by police that entrances or exits from the building are prohibited.
When he was told what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being informed that they will only be able to return to their homes in hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene bathed in tears.
He repeatedly says, “It’s so horrible.”
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the immediately outside area.
A number of police officers were stationed inside the cordon to guard the apartment building.
We ask anyone with information to contact DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament became the latest monument swallowed up by the contest of "historical revisionism"
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, reminiscent of the Taliban’s perpetration of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current debate over the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell at the Palace of Westminster would become a target to be shot down.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of historiography about a figure that many still believe to be worthy of tribute.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes an entirely precise description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety representing one side of that division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and commemoration."
Pig killer attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with an artery cut and covered in blood, near a slum in the market in Liupanshui, in Guizhou province, reads the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door to an open neighboring slum.
In that pocilga, he said, was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 227-pound pig had attacked the farmer to the death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and crushed," said the cousin, referred to by his nickname "Wu", according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked down to prevent it from attacking others while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Reports say Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare off the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as a “stimulus.”
"They're just kidding.
They like to nibble, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the entire Mexican north and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa caused 137 km/h gusts, a Category 1 hurricane located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical moisture northward in the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday, it will cause rainfall that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that point, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rainfall could cause dangerous flash floods, flooding with debris, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of up to 5 to 10 mm is expected in areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly aggravating conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall.
It is highly inadvisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rainfall can cause the gorges to turn into wild rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong spot winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring heavy rainfall over parts of the southern California coastline.
Total rainfall of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause small debris bumps and slippery roads.
This could be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical downpours will begin in Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
The month of October may experience strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools. However, tropical areas will remain quite mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a nearly 11-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to record a warm start to October, with temperatures ranging from 27 to 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of above-average temperatures occurring in the eastern U.S. by the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations the heartbreaking testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who allegedly accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with stations interrupting regular programming due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while drunk and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, stated that he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen on Friday, are likely to have attended the hearing.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulty measuring audiences of those who watch programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is an audience level similar to the final of an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh's nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day audience, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Then come CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being verbally attacked by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator to address a Judiciary Committee hearing.
The senator stood still staring at the ground as he was criticized live on CNN’s cameras.
“I am here before you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that “you have power while so many women have no power.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator door closed that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee went to vote to make Kavanaugh’s appointment proceed for a Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, which the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, as it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'politicizing' Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politicizing" Britain's future and damaging the national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside the front page of the newspaper, its former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the minister’s “Chequers Plan” for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU would cover the other side’s tariffs is “totally absurd”.
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Detain Suspect Dyteon Simpson of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to a statement from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, with police claiming that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, reports WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had fatally shot Wayde with a firearm.
A bond of $350,000 was set, the lawyer said.
The forensic office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that extended to the neck.
The department said collaboration from the Louisiana State Police action group, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area’s authorities for their “diligence and effort to get justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
This forward, 1.98m tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what we’re constantly worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash from Mexico City
Ash emanating from the Popocatépetl volcano has hit the neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Sunday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray covering car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in activity from the volcano, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were detained in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and the intervention police, as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, stopped by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and dusted paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are normally crowded with tourists.
There were also clashes later, in which the police resorted to sticks to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups chanting "We do not forget, we do not forgive" confronted Unionist protesters, who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region inclined towards independence, a year after the October 1 referendum that was deemed illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although voter turnout had been low, with a majority boycott of those against it.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations scattered across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
Although it was carried out, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we are blocked,” he said.
Despite a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year’s elections.
“Presenting myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we have witnessed on the part of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashes into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed repeatedly in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
At a certain point, someone may also have shot a beast at the car.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second loss of only two in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, as Gary Holt's team switched levels, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s team, which remains without a win away from home in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders with eight more points on Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, have extended their six-game series of undefeated matches in the division, with head coach Holt not losing a single game since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against numb visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead of the marker long before the goal, as the incisive character of his game was causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense but let himself be dragged in front of the goal and then Alan Lithgow only managed to steer his effort away after sneaking to find Craig Halkett's header over the goal.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing it could cause visitors trouble in stopping ball plays.
And that’s how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the big area.
At that point, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no big problems.
This pattern continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another Livingston stopping ball play.
Crossings continued to come to the large Livingston area, which were successively settled, and two large penalty claims, one after Halkett's assault on substitute Glenn Middleton and one after a hand, were rejected by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall at their best throughout the game.
In any case, the Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality shown sometimes with Gerrard, the team fell far short of these standards.
Their final move was uninspired (only once they managed to open the home team), constituting a sort of warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Ambiguously Received in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose aim was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside its country.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were present in the immediate vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car collision
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in southeastern Deptford, at around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died at the scene.
This collision comes months after another cyclist was killed in a runaway collision on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the person and inform his family.
Barriers and detours were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The unrest, which is still ongoing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents "Tornado" have been summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one ward.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained teams have been used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin hosts more than 500 inmates, among them some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disturbance in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with Sudden Floods (Drought Affected Areas May Benefit)
A tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s forecast for early next week when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for areas in southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state within a 300km radius of Phoenix since 1950!
The Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center’s latest models predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that may reach 10 mm.
For those unaffected by the risks of sudden flooding, the Rosa rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rainfall can be beneficial as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers at least from extreme drought, the second most severe category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the mainland by crossing the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still hurricane-heavy on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, lies 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to hit the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at nightfall on Monday.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 8 to 10 mm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with possible maximums of 25 mm," weather.com reported.
The Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. This will then head south of Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger of the Rosa or its remains is very high precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the Southwestern U.S. Desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are predicted to produce sudden, debris-filled floods in the deserts, which are life-threatening, and floods in mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with sharp gun injuries in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officers have appealed to anyone who may have cell phone footage of the incident to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'was a victim of the malice and anger' of the Democratic Party
“A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “was a victim of the malice and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually abused her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegation.
The president said Saturday that "the American people have witnessed the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote by one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a jurist with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president sideways referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not competing, but I’m actually competing,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for excellent candidates.”
Trump has argued that the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy of the Republican Party’s leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, many of them swept away by the giant waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred in the wake of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of what happened,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency to mitigate the effect of Indonesian disasters (BNPB) in a communication in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not move alone: it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Public aerial photographs by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, deformed and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s huge shock was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings were found, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communications "were totally disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves arose at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage posted on social media, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frenzied warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to the people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with help from Jakarta and other cities. However, the evacuees still desperately need food and other staples.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to Palau’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is rising exponentially to more than 800.
It's really bad.
Although they managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where staff are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of their offices, World Vision staff from Donggala went through scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's really bad.
Even as aid groups began to begin the dark tasks of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign financing, supplies and personnel can only have access to the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still at a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says 'OK, this is a national catastrophe' we can open the door to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist."
At the fall of the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the still missing still held out hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigate the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, which were concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paraglider, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began circulating among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the sportsmen of Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark, rather than a pair of blues.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves Take $26,750 During ATM Replenishment at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “arose running after the Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money that was intended for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her for "emotional reasons", the creator of the show said.
Being at the same time an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has for him a religious meaning, according to West.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, when he commented on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"Therefore, I am you, I am us, it is us.
It comes from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to just Ye – being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our mess, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO pledges not to resort to military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country nears the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador vowed on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza “never use the army to repress the Mexican people.”
Military personnel fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a death toll that may have risen to 300 as leftist student movements spread across Latin America.
López Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to students and opening more public universities.
The president said unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities are dragging young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding of artificial intelligence
At a time when China is stepping up its artificial intelligence activity, the U.S. is expected to double spending on artificial intelligence research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and research professional who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made AI-related announcements, even though the country does not have a formal global AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year to lead AI innovation by 2030.
“Duplicating the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the new AI revolution,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big success of AI will be achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello’s top-ranked American player. Later, he held executive roles at Microsoft Research and was president of Google’s China branch.
Lee credited previous U.S. government technology competitions as the Defense Department Agency’s Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects and asked when it would be next, with a view to helping identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a big effort to get state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s robbing academic leaders; it’s the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired university luminaires to work on AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically awarded to doctorates in AI,” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it is currently investing more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation intended to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not advanced for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on name change
Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," an initiative that would settle a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbor represents a complaint about its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised questions about whether the turnout will be enough to meet the 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue admission efforts in bodies with the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Elections Commission said there had been no record of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters attended to vote.
“I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on the country’s name change, which would open the door to its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up and not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure lower than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must exceed 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major failure in the pro-Western government’s policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses the entire defense of Brighton towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling obliterated Brighton's defense in a 2-0 victory over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy in his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the play.
He sprinted between three Brighton defenses before cutting to hit open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He faked a defense before neutralizing others in the race at the edge of Brighton’s big area.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with his right boot, defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-handed shot.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the early lead in the Premier League confrontation.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball right on Brighton's territory in that play.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field limits.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make the Rockies' lives harder
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there wasn’t much reason to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the final for the Rockies, who hold a lead in a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still have plans to secure their first-division title.
“Even if we are playing for nothing, at least we can get on the pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting pitcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make pitches in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, had a bullpen session on Thursday and would pitch in his normal position on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander goes 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president sidelined the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican turnout in midterm elections.
“Everything we did is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones ... I’m not competing, but I’m competing and that’s why I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates.”
Trump continued, “You’re watching this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you’re watching it happen right now.
And they are determined to regain power using every means necessary. Do you see the evil, the sordidness?
They don’t care who they attack, who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
“And they’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “aggressive, evil, sordid and lying.”
The president referred by name to Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and received loud vows from the public.
"Remember your answer?
Did you cause the document to leak?
Uh, uh, what?
No, um no, I, uh, wait, one -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has ceased to be inclusive.
It is intolerant of those who openly give their opinion.
When Momentum activists from my local party organization voted to censor me, it was no surprise to me.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan was subjected to similar treatment because she resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar themes on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday mentioned that "we intend the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the General Committee meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "kinder and gentler" policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever came true.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect a turnaround from me and that I would take positions I would never agree with - whether they were on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn’t really matter what I say), there follows a torrent of insults on social media that appeal to “firing,” denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I shouldn’t belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never back down before them.
One of the things that disappoints me the most in this age of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with every motion to "censor" or change the selection rules the party narrows its eyes.
I’ve received countless advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and that’s how “everything would be fine” for me.
But that's not why I came here to do politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my school literally comprehensive in rubble, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, either as mayor or as minister in government.
I never hid my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused as to my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who pushed the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country heads for a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the topic of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of “fire” or political expediency will prevent me from acting in the direction of what I believe are the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals somehow biased the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten without defeats.
In the end, it was superior defense and better risk management that made the home team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in our games so far and we remain unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The merit goes to Ayr. They managed the risks better than we did."
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, lent to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to express the numbers, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a big penalty, before, immediately before halftime, he scored and then converted a solo practice to put the score at 17-5 for Ayr at halftime.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced the downside to five points.
A long break followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was transported on a stretcher overseas and, after the restart, Ayr reinforced the lead with a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Acting Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted rehearsal by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense push.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Climo without the ball, on the penalty throw, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind Ayr's progressing maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick from David Armstrong and sent wing Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth rehearsal.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the catering business
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears ready to enter the catering industry after being named director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, soon to debut, will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a source in the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan was planning to get involved in the "flowing Glasgow catering business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a landlocked country, hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rope-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings bear a navy-blue flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the yearning to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes are perhaps at the highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on Oct. 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the ICJ on giant screens scattered throughout the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of their country’s claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, Evo Morales, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” the president said last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even if it did not.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to allocate Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IJC sentence is delivered only six months after hearing the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the past four years may have hurt it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined some residual Chilean goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility to "put an end to 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to go beyond the past.”
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without U.S. confidence
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to deliver on the promises it made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of rival countries.
His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart deadlocked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after Singapore’s summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an “impossible dream” to consider that the continued US sanctions and objection to a declaration that would put an end to the Korean war would ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington fears accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are planning a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang actually intends to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats en route to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the runway a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which left the style set amazed at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very impractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most prominent piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a wide feather-like flap that flooded the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-sieved watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in time for the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than they did with haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue this immense statement of fashion, you are in luck.
Observers of the styling predict that these huge hats will be on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent in the path of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm flap that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that spread through social networks sent another great creation to the catwalks: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the model in swimsuit that carried it.
The raffia bag in burnt orange color, adorned with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle, was the most outstanding piece of Jacquemus’ 2019 La Riviera spring-summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, “I’m waiting to see big hats and beach bags hit stores for next summer. Since the designer had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, and this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students spread across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to obtain the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further study and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of conceiving and implementing a bespoke school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain a popular and sought-after theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter into his heart.”
This quote reminds us well that we cannot just rely on English when we intend to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we found that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the maximum rating of A.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under the scope of the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained the maximum grade of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) topics in the curricula of independent schools and beyond.
A survey by the UK Committee on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that among the reasons for employers having difficulty filling vacancies, 17% were related to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio, 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for today’s children.
The mastery of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with better chances of finding relevant employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK for the 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron opens for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is ending for fans who want to see LeBron James start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will take part in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump begins a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the conformation vote pending for his Supreme Court pick, Trump intends to bolster support for the midterm elections to be held soon as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s hearings of Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate confirmation vote will be on hold for a week while the FBI proceeds with investigations.
However, the main goal of this torrent of rallies is to help Republicans, who face a difficult election in November, gain some momentum.
President Trump’s campaign officials said the five rallies next week were intended to “energize volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and enlarge the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so fundamental to the president’s agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the turmoil of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening rally could attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh area media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday marks the second time this month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him some help in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates strength to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday’s singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of momentum is a fully invented sports concept, but it is one that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum will come now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so we’re looking at it as a bit of momentum, I would say,” Jordan Spieth said as he left the field at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and plenty of reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them got three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural shouts of celebration grew louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His 15th-winning putt produced a similar scream of the kind that reveals he still believes the American team is still in the competition.
“We just need to focus and worry about our own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that remains for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, is four out of four and can't go wrong.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and into this turbulent crowd, the idea is consolidated that they are the players beating on Sunday, and that there is no player more popular to seal a potential European win at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of this morning’s fourballs, as they teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or don’t give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant lead on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a loose lead after coming out of Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood’s and Francesco Molinari’s inspired duet led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods struggling to make it to the four-point Le Golf National standings so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, battling to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two wins, but failed to shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row when he and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the only duo to win four points in their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating a powerless Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled through two games on Saturday, revealed occasional hits of genius, but has already lost 19 of the games he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating by 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always get the better of it.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the top men’s tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duo scored a bold 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team reversed a four-point handicap before the singles, although Furyk's title-holder team only needs to draw to retain the trophy.
After two days in second position, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond its means.
North Korea says 'not to think' of unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were aggravating mistrust of the United States and that there was no way for the country to unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way for us to proceed with our disarmament first.”
While Ri has recycled well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statements appear to be significant in that they do not in the first instance reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast to Pyongyang’s previous positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a U.S. president in office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, opposing even the 'declaration of an end to war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is aggravating our suspicion.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the stakeholder on this issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to this impasse.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that steering North Korea’s rockets toward U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. Mau” Trump called Kim the “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable for it, saying “whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must vigorously continue until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006 in a bid to strangle funding for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, although North Korea later denounced him for "making gangster demands.
In a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States “takes corresponding action.”
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” they were seeking were the security guarantees assumed by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend course that teaches them to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has put all its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the macho culture of studying in caffeinated “directs.”
One professor concluded that students at the university at the top of the world rankings often had no idea about the most basic concepts about self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end, a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?'
The young woman stated that no one had ever mentioned to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are briefed on how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as we all have a right to know the health effects of the smoking option,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “making direct” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we get enough quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid getting fat, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler conceive the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a campus-wide course, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program of study before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm when going to bed, as well as when waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can dysregulate circadian rhythm and lead to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of sadness away from home when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team a 1-0 loss at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox’s team were looking to score their first win on their course since their 1-0 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team ended up inflicting Gerrard’s second loss in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the Scottish First Division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers collective, devoid of inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With the Rangers now descending to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, and only behind the Hibernian for the difference in goals.
And there could be even more trouble for the Rangers after line prosecutor Calum Spence was treated for a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the visitor’s area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, for his part, used the same Livingston eleven that stole a point from Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with how his well-oiled team stifled opponents in every move.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the one they had.
The team could have scored as early as two minutes after the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered his big opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs came against Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish out towards the second beam.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but the hope was greater than the belief in their game in the final third.
Surely Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a big quarter-hour penalty with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson refused the Colombian’s appeals.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingston’s goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected from the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, let alone for its tenacity.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' long stopping ballplay.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who remained calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this trade almost had an immediate impact when the forward moved to Morelos, but impressive Kelly sprinted from his line to make the block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes after long passes.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the finals, but McGregor held up well, defending against Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again complained of a large penalty when he blew up in Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanaque: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: On September 30, 1882, he is now 136 years old and continues to TELL ... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, the Geiger accountant has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like a uranium.
When we put these headphones on, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's crackling right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave the name still endures.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches Immune System to ‘See’ Harmful Cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to “see” harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in a laboratory.
These cells, which can “see” a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2. These cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “controls the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Berzofsky said.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe of support for Trump wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed at the studio on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a “Make America Great” hat, he began a bravado against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white guy and he says, 'How can you like Trump? He's racist!'
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcast, the scene of West's bravado was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They intimidated me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go over there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the marginalization?", saying, "I'd wear my superman cloak, because that means no one tells me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments provoked public bereavement and the SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with someone from the show telling the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days ago.
West confused many with performing the song I Love It disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a rally of support from TPUSA’s conservative group director, Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: “To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FACING THE TURBA.”
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being what it is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying their music or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is welcoming and propagating ideologies harmful to the community.
He's free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg once used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the defunct musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Accusation of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, stating that such roles on screen often make boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that he has a “quite strong position” on how to tackle the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
“What have we been teaching men when they are growing up in terms of the problem we are seeing now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he said, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I believe this is one of the great questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because clearly something went very wrong for young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter into any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, noting that, for him, the "battlefields and horses" are over.
Starting in November, Kit will take part in a reissue of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on.”
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple tied the knot in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual annual variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90% of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
The Chinese government has pledged since 2003 universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leak of information about Republican senators by her collaborator and attacks "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her team published personal information of three members of the U.S. Senate on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the charges were being promoted by opinion leaders and “ultra-right” websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court appointee.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with Waters’s office and published the data of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by virtue of these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility in this information leak.
This baseless accusation is wholly false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“That suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot be angry.
You can't have a defiant posture.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
You have to show calm and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who will take Waters's place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "the competent authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
"We assure you that the culprits will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally held accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff."
Johnny English review Back to Attack - weak spy movie parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for Brexit connotations in any new film with a British flavor, and this seems in fact to apply to the new edition of the comedy and action film series Johnny English, started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satire about being so bad the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his squeaky eyes and overly elastic expression got his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name signaling, more than anything else, that it is a comprehensive comic creation intended for non-English-speaking moviegoers.
He is, of course, the idiot secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to a soft glamor, has a little Cloiseau, a hint of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the film "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mystery man whose role Atkinson played in the TV commercials for the Barclaycard, which left chaos in his wake.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene in which Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a chime against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but the humor sounds weak and oddly superfluous, especially considering that "serious" film editions like 007 and Mission: Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We’re left with the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film numbers in Bean’s character.
Now, the ever-present premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the top-secret British spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the dismay of the service agent, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicted figure, already suffering a total debacle of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for large flights.
Your intelligence advisers inform you that once all the agents on duty have been compromised, you will have to take someone out of retirement.
And that someone is the clumsy Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a fancy school, but giving unofficial lessons on how to be an undercover spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "School of Rock".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall for emergency instruction and rejoins his suffering assistant Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, an exuberant character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the catastrophe in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, the role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously bewitched by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd, disastrous acts: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a glamorous French restaurant, create confusion by penetrating the luxury yacht of Volta as clandestines, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of the house of Volta.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but as nice and stormy as it is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And as in the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to her talent?
Workers deny that they are engendering a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receiving five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to give Britain a four-day workweek, but with five paid days.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to hand over savings with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers, granting them an extra day off.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the orderly.
Sources say the idea "would fit" into the party's economic program, which reorients the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day workweek won the favor of the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: “We look forward to announcing a policy review before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an adjusted aspiration to the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not favored at this time by the entire Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: “The four-day workweek is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
Shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party’s conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of the “faceless directors” and “speculators” of basic services companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the entire share of the current shareholders of water companies, since the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illicit conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to put workers on the company’s boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, who may pocket dividends that can amount to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh may or may not change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I was going to the hearing," he said, "I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this allegation came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immovable.
"I am determined as to Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive indictment would be necessary," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentioned couldn’t confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an extremely impressive list of stars who will perform on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people to the Great Central Park Lawn, not only to watch performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or any other significant ways that contribute to raising awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
However, what has been the degree of success of the Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of “cliticism” – do you think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters that have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to world leaders having announced commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion of them already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” which has pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote of history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 pressure actions on the UK to improve mothers’ and children’s nutrition, the government announced that it would fund a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the website's frequently asked questions, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replies, “It’s been a long, tortuous road — sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as ‘blockade’ to curb Russia’s energy exports
“If necessary,” Washington could turn to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, in particular where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to intermediate energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of Southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to make blockades to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In his speech, he went on to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, referring to them as effectively the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as a “magic one-trick” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inadequate” Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, aims to double existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons, being an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “deeply consider” the possibility of running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “deeply consider” running for president following the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the top culprit,” she said.
“After November 6, I will look deeply into the possibility of running for president.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, noting that he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s own constituents are not of the opinion that she should run for president in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Research.
32% support his candidacy.
The poll revealed superior support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated over a potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through after he’s back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers are actually coming back with,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "come back a little different, come back hardened, come back wondering if there is such respect for what his comrades soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, have given to the country."
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence on a woman and gun possession while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district sent a statement amicus curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy has not been revealed.
The person said her partner "and his children, members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
The plaintiff was arrested in Texas.
Public prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Resources Council that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates that principle,” the amicus curiae statement reads.
The lawyers also argued in that statement that the police’s ban on entry of immigrants negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in a time trial to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, 35, the mother of a feverish male baby, said as she comforted him at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save anything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
There were hundreds of wounded and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured his ribs and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated overseas due to strong aftershocks that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears as he recounted how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Intimidation” with “Propaganda Ads”
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, the state’s largest newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in Nov. 6 congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the beginning of what U.S. officials, in statements to Reuters, called a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue announcements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff waves on the other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press.”
"With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of free speech and press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
“In contrast, in the stalls here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of views that the Chinese may have of their country’s worrying economic trajectory, as the media are under firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault charges, analysts warn that this could provoke a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward with a vote.
These things have no setback," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants chanted “November is on the doorstep!” when demonstrating in the Senate lobby, given that Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will break all records,” Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no party affiliation, told the news site.
“People say it’s already tall; it’s true.
But it may be even higher, particularly among undecided voters in suburban areas and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could occur if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his seat as a judge, it’s also about how Republicans handled the matter and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the former.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony absolutely or probably, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had likely or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford’s allegations, as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford reported under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually molested her as an alcoholic when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court appointee exposed his genitals when the two were attending a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project by this legendary tech character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that Inrupt's underlying intention is to "dominate the world."
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data warehouse,” or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about online personal data storage is that it is solely up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some in-house programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over internet neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Tribute to the Clergyman Awarded the Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in his hometown after 100 years.
The Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on 29 September 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he received the highest British military honor.
Her two grandchildren uncovered a commemorative plaque at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the deed that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under close fire of portable weapons and machine guns".
He then ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage," led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and shooting down three soldiers of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never match, but also a lesson in humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a genuine hero is to be demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts wake up all night to watch Bellator 206 instead watch Peppa Nut
Imagine this: you stay up all night to see Bellator 206, full of stars, and in the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 matches, with six from the main group, and was airing live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o’clock in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the showdown, viewers in the UK were amazed when the cover shifted to Porca Peppa.
Some were not impressed after they had been up until dawn especially for combat.
A Twitter fan described the move to children’s cartoons as “a kind of tasteless joke.”
“Government regulation says the content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to another schedule,” Dave Schwartz, a marketing and communications administrator, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Fuck Peppa, yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said the company would rectify the broadcast schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem,” Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning there and we can't resolve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday British time.
But we're working on it.
I’m not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We thought it was a technical error.
But it was not: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and exaggerated.
This is a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" to his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claimed that he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that this gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out in favor of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also claimed that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The show’s longtime regular host, Kirsty Young, took a several-month break due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley noted that he felt "inferior" to all the others because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
“To this day, that impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
His goal was to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and has used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he expressed why he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “took me by surprise.”
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, 20 years his senior, although he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When we go through so much when we're so young" - his first Olympic participation was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son last June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole outlook" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all that mattered was ‘earning a gold medal,’” he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the London 2012 games because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not going to be around to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I was fully aware that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics ... there was no better feeling,” he said.
All this was also the inspiration for his first song choice - Proud, by Heather Small - with which he had identified during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer time.
Mickelson down in form at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record high on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to regain his shape to prevent the milestone from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record-breaking turnout, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Rather than being at the center of the action, as he has so often been on the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the men’s top league split the day between supporting role and work on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what afflicts him.
Never giving the most straight shots even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf Nacional course, where the long rough usually punches the wandering shots.
And if the field alone wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, will face precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage starting all 12 singles games, score a good start, Mickelson’s departure could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
“He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a respected champion who has given a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn’t seen him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we'd have to move on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never matched the successes of your individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, though Furyk has claimed that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
“He’s sarcastic, funny and witty, likes to play with people and is a great person to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week as well, which was fun to watch.
He gives us so much more than just playing.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows his big advantage could disappear in no time.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his loose lead on entering the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily become a bumpy ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros kept a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with his nose at the narrowest of the margins, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by little," Bjorn said in the image, after witnessing the victory of the 2018 Tournament by 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead by 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, do your best.
Go in there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the scoreboard.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus must remain.
I’ve always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of who’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself on this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is the individual performances and that involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we’re there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message that must be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, do your best.
Now they’re going to leave their partner and he has to go and give his best as well.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these big twists on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe pulled the "Miracle in Medinah" from the hat.
"I remember every word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When that momentum heads to one side, the pressure is too great in these mid-games.
We've organized our squad accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, we're going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, on a mission to try to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the first half of the game.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers the entire journey,” Bjorn said of his choices for the singles.
New German warship once again postponed
The latest German navy frigate was expected to enter service in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but it will need to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to failure and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the command ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit which quoted a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but troubling post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the navy had commissioned in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance, which would allow sending the latest frigates on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, continued delays have meant that state-of-the-art warships, seen as a way for Germany to project power across borders, will be out of date when they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The unfortunate F125 made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cites a number of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the contingent needed on the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
It is also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to install additional functionalities in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to have twice the weight of ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion, an increase from the EUR 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems plaguing the latest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used.
The problem has grown exponentially over time as older ships have been put out of service without vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class had been able to join the navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
New research is underway on a property in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats, as well as the long-eared browns and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered throughout the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will assess the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviors at the territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
These animals are threatened by the construction and development work that affect the dormitories and make the habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning are also a threat, along with fly-killing papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given your nocturnal hunting habits, your ears are more useful than your eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly carry out studies, inspections of dormitories and sometimes rescues.
He also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave we have an excellent area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there’s still a lot about bats that we don’t know about, so the work we’ve done here and on the other properties will help us learn more about what they need to flourish.”
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance on the properties, because the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don’t know how their populations are taking revenge.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the rape allegations against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The forward of the Portuguese national team and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he then paid $375,000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, reads Friday's Der Spiegel.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, the 33-year-old characterised the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the chamber.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I’m a happy man and it’s all right,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they characterized as "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99%" "a good guy", hurt by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to enter into an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “terrorized by the prospect of retaliation” and worried about the possibility of “being publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old woman now says she intends to annul the deal because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged assault. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a business of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' losing car manufacturers
The UK would “repent forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary for Enterprise Greg Clark.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU disorderly at the end of March, we will see production stops at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other automakers in the UK have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border transactions will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what manufacturers claim to be supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is managed on a just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s “Chequers Plan” for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the seizure for us of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to move forward with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Although it could not give an estimate of the downtime, Toyota said that in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could, sooner or later, lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union there, said its members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” as there is still no agreement on Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court appointee, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
The fact that Trump may be preparing to fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of covertly recording talks with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been set, it may be this week but it may also be postponed another week, in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disagree with such a statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonism."
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question and answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, adding, without gathering evidence: “We have analyzed those numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this often, and you've seen that we've done it in recent weeks, and the fact that you can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions on leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences, while receiving foreign representatives.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way before the journalists present.
Health minister writes to EU workers at Scottish National Health Service about Brexit fears
The Health Minister wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and ask them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the UK’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to fund applications for resident status for EU citizens working in the country’s decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "Over the course of the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal have continued, with decisions expected for this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tigers' Mike Organ said.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He approached the sideline and practically passed out," Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff placed Abercrombie oxygen in the sideline before placing it on a stretcher and transporting it for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type/severity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which raises his season total to 18 tackles.
A higher stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers when acquiring properties in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher stamp tax on foreign buyers buying properties in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in aid to the homeless.
The move will counteract the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract younger voters
The increase in stamp tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp tax rate will be charged to foreign buyers buying properties in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in aid for the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to counteract the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract younger voters, with promises to provide more affordable housing and tax higher incomes.
The stamp tax hike will focus on people and businesses that are not taxed in the UK, with the additional revenue boosting the government’s campaign to offer a ceiling to the homeless.
The surcharge — added to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and lease purchases — could amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new construction in London is acquired by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to access the market.
Many thriving areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by grabbing land they don’t use, demanding that Mrs May abandon quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “housing misfortune.”
Mr Corbyn announced an appealing set of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to evictions "without justification".
It also wants to give municipalities expanded powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy a home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for British workers living in the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has become too distant, and the shame of those who sleep on the floor is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old Scot has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the Northeastern club, currently third in the Premier League, three points from the lead.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on their return to the Scottish First Division last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got one B internationalization,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound program.
“I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if you succeed in managing clubs.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he was not afraid to succeed such established names in such a large club, after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, at the moment success boils down to ‘can I bring the club back to the Premier League?’
"Given the structure and facilities of the club, his place is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
“It won’t be easy to get the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I reach that goal.”
Ross’s coaching career is only three years old, after a period as Dumbarton’s assistant coach and 15 months on the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the downhill to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of relegation to the championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I’ve always seen myself more in the role of coach than in the role of player.
It sounds strange because it went well, I made a living as a player and had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and pressures of the position, but I feel very good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heatwave filled British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Catering groups saw 2.7% growth in sales in July, but restaurant occupancy declined 4.8%, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, who compiled the statistics, said: “Continued good weather and England’s longer-than-expected career in the World Cup have made the June standard, in which pubs recorded a 2.8% growth in sales, repeat in July, but restaurants experienced a retreat.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the business based on drinks had by far the best performance, with an annual growth that more than compensated for the decline of restaurants.
Pubs with the meal-based business also experienced difficulties, though not as dramatic as those of catering operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% over the month, with meals falling 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM leisure and catering analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing the sales of the food market outside the home.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is especially damaging when added to the prolonged cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators with the meal-based business. Only time will tell if the milder temperatures we know in August will provide the much-desired relief."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launch.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in five children hides secret social media accounts from their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — has secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers, a study has revealed.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rise in “fake” Instagram pages
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 years old – creates social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake” accounts on the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news aggravates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have an innocuous "main" account to show their parents, while simultaneously owning private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found that the teen incited others to “rape” her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Board of Directors (HMC), found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to holding private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected Non-Executive Director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the regulator’s annual General Assembly.
President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sport regulators to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletics community and we are confident that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain from her presence on the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am excited to be able to act as the voice of athletes and I look forward to truly contributing to helping guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, has failed to walk after suffering a transient ischemic stroke.
As he wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month since I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk anymore.
The doctors said only time would tell if he could recover and to what extent.
It has been a painful job but I have achieved a total recovery, I have learned to walk again and I even do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Ad Of Milk Extraction Pump Compares Mothers To Cows, Splitting The Online Opinions
A milk pump company has split online opinions with an ad comparing mothers who breastfeed cows in milking.
To mark the launch of what is described as the “first portable silent milk pump,” consumer technology company Elvie released an ironic ad inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom the new pump gives to mothers who draw milk.
Four mothers dance in a hay-filled barn to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The refrain goes on: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, I'm milking my girls."
However, the announcement posted on the company’s Facebook page generated controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it alleviates the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“Sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born,” one spectator wrote.

Another commented: “Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise an extraction pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone also said, "An advertisement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious".
“I think the idea is brilliant.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy but it makes perfect sense.
This product is genius,” one of the women wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract milk (often in the bathroom or in the workplace) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who pump milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies, and even leave the house while pumping out milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between the women who extract milk and the dairy cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new pump.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb had made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Discreetly Displaced to a Camp on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has peaked, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most of the “parents” are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adults who integrate their households would have to register their fingerprints, the data being shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the service detained dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
“About 80% of sponsors or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners with criminal records.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
Seeking to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to staff at the reception centers.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, to defend their request for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent attacks or attempts to flee, according to staff at reception centres and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities like Tornillo’s, where the large size contributes to children’s disturbance signals being ignored.
They add that transferring children to camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that still left millions displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led the refugees to remain abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe zone in Idlib’s last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement established "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists, including Al-Nusra Front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, setting the stage for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the panel’s work should be limited “to reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warning against possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the impeachment and scandals end his presidency early.
In what would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of spectators tiredness.
Since 2014, prime-time audiences have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primetime viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the cable’s audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"This is a strong appeal to people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor," about a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He recalls once calling a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Naturally, unlike television shows, stories from Washington could determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunification of immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing programs is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it’s more than just being an informed citizen when we’re watching the sixth hour of an expert debate about Bob Woodward’s use of sources “with deep knowledge” in his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a Presidential garment full of insolence,” as the Washington Post referred to) and the implications of the scabromy descriptions of...
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“Some of what he’s been doing feels like a reality show because he gives us something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s dynamic cast and the daily twists and turns of the plot (antagonizing the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
We can't miss any episodes or we're left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up at home, watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He didn’t shy away from television as Brett Kavanaugh prepared to testify before the Senate Justice Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right after all."

Significant external funding in midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th-circle is experiencing an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of constituencies that left two incumbents in the race for the same spot.
The recent re-adjustment of Pittsburg suburban circles put in the race Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb runs against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s former 12th Circle, which largely overlaps with the new 17th Circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old circles unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The race for the 17th circle has sparked a bitter fight for campaign funding between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested March extraordinary election for the 18th Congressional constituency of Pennsylvania.
That seat was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to Democrats.
U.S. considers punishing El Salvador for backing China
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked the Trump Organization out of the board.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call the leaders of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
Following the internal meetings, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to move forward, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three American representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate outlined by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be dropped could be Attorney Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, about which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will reportedly be directing his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to attack the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability from that body, as he prepares to stand again with voters and perhaps be judged by his peers.
There are many hypotheses and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of combat.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or slowed.
The Americans are currently facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president, speculating about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the Times news is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s newly requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe that we will not fail, due to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she had me light Sabbath candles at that swastika table.
With such a legacy, how could you not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians following their impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month will leave them in a good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making the season’s first game to a two-goal draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use that result as a springboard for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We approached the game with a positive mindset and we won a point.
Perhaps we could have won close to the end but, in global terms, the draw was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first half but we turned around and dominated in the second half.
Thursday will be another big European night.
It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year has been very hard, with all my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there is a good atmosphere.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training is going well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success.”
Women Are Losing Sleep Afraid of This Retirement Savings Account
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of the type of care they want to receive, few people have spoken to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
“People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they’re not having that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not let them know your wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your continuing care financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover those expenses, or financing using your own savings, as long as you have those amounts available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care attorney by choosing a person you trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Also consider setting up a power of attorney on your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make the financial decisions for you, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is suffering a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“Not only financial issues are at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan."
Man shot multiple times with air pressure at Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure on his way home after a night in the city.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a “random act.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries were not life-threatening and police sought witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications interrupted, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with an administrative status lower than that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006 – A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami to hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 quake hit the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Accusations
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been detained on assault charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was detained on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin is being held pre-trial at Mat-Su’s pre-trial detention center, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, pleading “obviously innocent,” the station reported.
Palin faces three class A charges, meaning he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable by one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of slapping her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans’ associations after associating her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the central Sulawesi region, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social networks showing the moment of the impact.
Hundreds of people were gathering for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York
The New York Public Prosecutor’s Office is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city — a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a bicycle lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, running over pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and inflicted “intentionally” serious injuries, according to the death penalty notification, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder in the service of organized crime, typically used by the prosecution in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “considerable planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed it as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the South Zone of New York asked for the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage acts on behalf of the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documentation, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s defense lawyers, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty confession for life imprisonment, with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Conservatives' congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s deputies suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK "would have left" if Farage had been Brexit minister.
But May’s challenge to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionists was underscored by staying conservatives, who staged a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister has been debated to uphold her compromise plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit supporters, permanence advocates and the EU.
Allies insist she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan."
Bone suggested that responsibilities should have been assigned to Farage in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have left already,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.”
Reinforcing his opposition to the EU, he declared: "We have not fought in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to stay is totally misguided.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration, telling reporters: “I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Only prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs."
Farage said at the rally that politicians should “feel the pressure” if they are ready to betray the decision to leave the 2016 referendum.
“This has become a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get away with it.”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the people’s army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing UK.”
However, the supporters of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A crowd of activists wielded banners with the message “Conservatives Against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
“It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for ‘Canada More’, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete hoax.
There is no good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren Plans to ‘Seriously Consider’ Possible Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a habitual critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that he could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump’s inauguration.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it’s time “for women to go to Washington to fix our government’s problems and that includes a woman at the top.”
Arrest in connection with LSU Tigers murder of Wayde Sims
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, and died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to his presence at the scene, wielding a gun, acknowledging that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-metre junior raised in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and started 10 times last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the pits and caused Hamilton to face the traffic at the end of the peloton, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the pits one lap later and trailed Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a grinding skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track free, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen came out of the last line of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, changing tires too late, which would allow him to be quick in the final part, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He eventually came to the pits on lap 44 but failed to improve his pace on the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me overtake him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Bad body language
President Donald Trump derided Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she would not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “bad, malicious and false.”
“Look at the beautiful thing that’s been going on in the Senate in the last few days, look at the anger, look at how bad, malicious and fake people are,” Trump said.
“When we see the leaks and the press releases and when they say ‘oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you run away?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no, no, no.
The escape didn’t come from me.”
Well, wait a minute.
The escape came from us... No, it wasn’t us,” she added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the leak occurred in early September, but denied that the leak had left his office.
"I have not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations, I have not disclosed her story," Feinstein told the commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who remarked during Saturday night’s rally: “You know what, that was terrible body language.
Maybe it wasn’t her, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see the evil, the malice, no matter who they can hit, who have to step in to take power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from Friday's First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second leg 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants took a two-goal lead with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
François Bouchard drew for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald’s two goals secured the team’s victory.
It was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had taken a turn on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frantic first period, Sullivan put the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt tied Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants reached the first break in the lead, scoring their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard tied again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, host Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Help Hundreds of Passengers Escape Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are still missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to ravage the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to escape, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post as the control tower shook violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained focused to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower, facing the imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
However, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, the country’s disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The toll is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the debris that we have not yet been able to rescue," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces at the site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that took the lives of more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now informs that there is a man missing after the plane crashes in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a man missing after communicating that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The area company said it was working with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all with a stable medical condition.
It is not yet known for sure what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the runway and crashed into the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming too low.
“It was the best thing that ever happened,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others had managed to crawl the water around his waist and get to the sinking emergency exits of the plane.
He said that the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on a nearby dock improvement also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday at a new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used his cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old defendant Quintom Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several mobile phones that confirm Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday and said he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by claiming he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Cell phone records indicated they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“You wiped her out of your life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin presenting its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be reviewed by the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol's The High Breed group claims that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to go back to those roots and return popularity to conscientious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for firing via 'racist' text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denied allegations of racism, saying the lawsuit was an act of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed some fear when she discovered that new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she performed for her first day of work in 2016.
“I CAN’T BELIEVE . . . MORE BLACK,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she became aware of her gaffe, an "embarrassed" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice alleging the previous African-American nanny's poor performance and that she was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home from Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and seeking severance pay of $350/day for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
“I want to show them that they can’t go unpunished,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying firing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t really want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to someone you had mistreated, even by mistake?
Your newborn child?
I can't believe it."
Calling the process "extortion," Plasco said his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
“Are you going to chase someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
As the legal process proceeds, the court of public opinion has been quick to condemn the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers might not identify with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: “It’s hard to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It’s so much fun to hear about it now, after Paddington has been so successful.”
He said his father, who worked as a camera operator for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children’s book, would not have taken it to heart if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication had a bittersweet taste given his passing last year.
About Paddington, who he described as “a very important member of our family,” he said the father was very proud of the success achieved.
“He was a modest man and not a person given to bragging,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we’re proud even when the feat isn’t ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
Soon after landing, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain to save her life.
“Nad would often call to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“So Nad called to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medicines doctors had given her to keep her heart working were slowly stopping working and leaving her system.
He had died a while ago and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stand there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not scream or lament because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold on to myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers outside the ordeal she was going through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I always cried with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
She knew how much he loved her."
Grieving Women Post Cards on Bridge to Prevent Suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide fight to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been affixing cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to get support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to have to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Sharon Davis, 45, a resident of Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it lighted up the room."
However, he gave up his job before dying because he had "dipped into the darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said: "I'm always worried about a possible repercussion."
Sharon Davis created the postcards "so that they know that there are people who are available to help and with whom they can talk, even if they are a friend.
Do not shut yourselves up, you have to speak."
Kelly Humphreys, Sharon Davis’ longtime friend, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after her mother-in-law died.
“I wasn’t saying I was sad or depressed,” he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a rag. When the kids opened the gifts, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it’s something they have to overcome: “It destroys a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation
“I thought that by having the likeness of what I had asked for – an investigation with defined time and scope – we could be closer together,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “collapsing” in the face of an entrenched partisan impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is a merely temporal matter.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Supreme Court thwarted.
George W. Bush has contacted senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI presents your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tiebreaker vote and confirm his seat on the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors declines during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un’s rise to power seven years ago.
Citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defections last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as people smugglers asking for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean defectors.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the deadlocked denuclearization talks.
The talks followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed broadly to collaborate on the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve on Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations of sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotionally open statement, sometimes in a shrill, sobbing voice, as he talked about his family and high school years.
He also explicitly accused the committee’s Democrats, calling the allegations made against him a “grotesque and conspiratorial murder” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves she is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court given her prejudiced behavior against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
When asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's effective appointment and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don’t qualify to be on the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge in the D.C. District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he feared potential opinions from Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe v. Wade case, given his reputation as a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh circumvented questions about the possibility of revoking certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and hope that we will be happy with the decision,” Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control their emotions.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and it cannot vent without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinen told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a strange thing, do you?"
A woman in an executive position in any company helped me a lot. She told me that I also cried when I was angry, but I had created a technique. When I was angry and started crying, I would say to the person I was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he kept going.
And I thought to myself... it’s brilliant,” continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job in a male-dominated office crying out of inexpressible anger, being grabbed by the neck by an older woman — an unfriendly manager who frightened me a little — and literally dragged down the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy they’ve been able to affect you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado Democratic congresswoman, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder couldn’t see why she couldn’t run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who dubbed the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given his late entry, the fundraiser was short of what was desirable and he swore he would only enter the race if he managed to raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, even though they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
“Do you think I’m entitled to a discount?” he asked.
When she announced that she was not going to enter a formal campaign, emotions came up — gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and getting the message out to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism — and tears sprang up.
“It even looked like I was depressed,” Schroeder recalled as she spoke about the media’s reaction.
“I would have thought that Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you write on my epitaph now?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the U.S. and China could be beneficial for Beijing
The first salvo of the trade war between the U.S. and China was deafening, and while the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of experts, the two countries’ departure may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week saw a significant worsening of the situation with new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing in reality half of all goods shipped by China to the U.S.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 percent to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will falter in the near future.
Making Washington back would mean succumbing to demands, but showing public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. could positively sustain China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“In reality, the fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could have ever anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready for return of refugees
Syria says it is prepared for the refugees’ voluntary return and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have left due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European National Team beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive losses on European soil since the last time it won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is once again crowned victorious after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties during almost the entire tournament, threw the starting tee into the water in hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shined in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst-ranked player of the European national team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world’s top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England in what may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the most awarded European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“It’s not my habit to cry, but today I couldn’t contain myself.
It's been a tough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He gives the floor to his compatriot Jon Rham who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the rest of the U.S. National Team struggled to make it to the fairway.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear in Europe.
We fought.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like a lot of these 12 players and I’m proud to be their captain.
I have to take the hat off the other team.
