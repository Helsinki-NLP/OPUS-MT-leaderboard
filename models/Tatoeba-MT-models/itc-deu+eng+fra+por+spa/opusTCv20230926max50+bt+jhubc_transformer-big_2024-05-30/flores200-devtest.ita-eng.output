We agree with the USOC that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be better served by making meaningful change within our organization, not by decertifying.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides greater details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage does not have the basic structure, the so-called spine, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, beards and chins, the researchers concluded that the spine is likely the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship.The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult plumage and not the chick down.
According to the hypotheses of the researchers, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals a feather from an adult specimen and not that of a chick.

Brightness is used together with rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the lower the star's activity compared to magnetic inversions.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate surveys of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on Earth that generates tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to infer that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that “normal” matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a halo species, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has identified extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal.
According to a statement released in an interview, this new variant was “highly concerning and alarming, because of the high mortality rate.”
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the microbe inside the hospital, and at least two of them were health care workers at the hospital itself.

In France, voting is traditionally a non-technological experience: voters enter an isolated booth and put in an envelope a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate chosen.
After verification of his identity by officials, the elector deposits the envelope in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

The candidates can send their representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the volunteers carry out the counting of the votes under strict control, in accordance with the specific procedures.

Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at a fifth man's head. Schneider has constant pain, is blind from one eye, is missing a skull section, and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to Wednesday’s event, Carpanedo participated in two individual Championship races.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, saw her rank tenth in the women's group of the "sitting" category, with a combined ride time of 4:41.30, slower of 2:11.60 minutes than the first classified, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower of 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of the Hungarian Danyi Gy.
Four women’s group skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh were able to recover the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman and we also found her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
However, the driver was severely injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering her own son.
She is detained pending trial and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish courts have other parameters. The Scottish courts have considered the publication of photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, “Journalists who post photos or otherwise of suspicious subjects are walking on undermined ground.”
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for court proceedings, told reporters that no further comments would be made until at least the formal indictment.
According to what has been leaked, the subject of the document will be the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the Middle East War of 1967.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence for only five years.
Shooters within the experimental program for controlling pests had to be closely monitored by rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS in partnership with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of NPWS's Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in by a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly’s fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission was Martelly’s response to widespread protests, which began in October, challenging the regime.
Occasionally violent protests have been sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of another 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company called “non-serious”.
In its response, the ministry called Apple’s postponement of the report “absolutely deplorable.”
The quake in the Mariannes was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no damage has been reported to the nation.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no tsunami signals in place.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued, at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins retraced his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
After training in obstetrics, in 1959 she went to work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, in his spare time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two ‘black boxes’ with flight records.
His fellow wrestlers also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, exactly like her. A strong woman."
“Luna was weird like me... Maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... Hopefully she’s in a better place,” said Dustin “Goldust” Runnels.
According to the survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia's transition to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal election, Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believed that Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This view is shared by 34% of survey respondents, according to whom Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
In contrast to the survey, 29 percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but it accused several ailments that led to doubts about his fitness.
He could not take the necessary medications to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, the material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he put his signature on a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing more than “talking and political idiocy”.
A candidacy for the presidency is expected in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system employs satellite technology rather than obsolete ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while there are no car parks or interchange parking spaces available on site.
Fears related to the lack of means of transport have led to the possibility of having the match played obligatorily behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of birds would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from Princeton University and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in as little as two generations, although the time required for this process was thought to be much longer; this was due to the effect of mating between a Darwinian endemic finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any kind of shape. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to form a thin thread, suitable to be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it was used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "miniature codes" precisely because of the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the analyzed chemical is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been torn away (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, put them in a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a running water bath with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, in the dwellings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, remains of sewers have been discovered.
Cabinets in antiquity also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes inserted into public bathrooms, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and vision in part.
To transport a satellite or telescope to space, a rocket more than 100 feet tall is required.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is to have provided us with easier and faster transports.
Thanks to his invention, they made their appearance the train, the car and several other means of transport.
Below them are other medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The concept of niche is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called herds.
The herds are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach up to 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The herd of lions acts in a very similar way to the herd of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other large felines), also with regard to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a tensile force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) of the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they go hunting for monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) thanks to the smell, smelling on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to the night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ocelots camouflage themselves with the surrounding environment and then fall on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island, thus making it difficult for it to return), it will likely find itself in an environment different from that in which it was before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so in order to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is breathed in by humans and absorb carbon dioxide expelled from them (through exhalation).
The plants process their nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our homes from plants and produce clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the super predator of his era and for this reason he feared nothing but the other mosasaurs.
From his long jaws sprang more than 70 sharp razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed his path there was no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it is possible that he had a bifurcated tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although most of their food would appear familiar to us, Roman banquets also provided for several strange or unusual meals, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a species of rodent called gurrus.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men loved to feast together lying on their side while eating their meal.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include several foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a principal temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an internal sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Much of the Jewish family’s life took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who named it, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, by that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although all were "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you have seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is drawn a treasure map.
Anyway, this is a fake. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was affixed only as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent clashes had led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, or those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action took the name of "Operation Dragoon".
The American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and were heading for Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in some way therefore also defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through several generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through an equitable diffusion.
Lesser cultures often disappear without significant historical traces, not being recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states for the first time formed a weak central government, and the Congress was the only component, according to the Statute of the Confederacy.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
He did not even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
The amendment of the articles required the unanimous consent of all the states, who had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports there are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
There are almost 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
Geographically, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that make up it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who were passing by little register the name of the island with the name of Ilha Formosa, or wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation involving Aboriginal grain production systems and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Window.
Most of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the site of Machu Picchu had been recovered, but restoration work is still underway.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most commonly used film at the end of the analogue photography era.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are the same or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, was titillated to be examined.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and customary differences.
Its ubiquitous power has influenced everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the money reserves of the church exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire sections of the ocean, also putting neutral ships at risk.
Because this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and viciousnesses of World War I, the nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars arose among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to win a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an Palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, among them the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers itself a very clear picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave stands on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you knew it existed. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one not in ruins.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plain, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The indication "arc above" resembles a V and the indication "arc below" resembles a staple or a square without the lower side.
Upward means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downward means that you should start from the alamaro (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards you.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while a descending arc results in a louder and more decisive sound.
You can decide to add your personalized pencil directions, but keep in mind that the archery signs that you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse of 11 years and Louis Charles of 4 years) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
In a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly the enormous profits from the exploitation of the Philippine people over time constituted the profits at the base of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars you must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The epoch in which the events took place is commonly called the Early Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the strict sense that the destiny of man is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves a development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Within the framework of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time customs and culture have arisen related to such geography that, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a hub of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its prestige declined, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slow pace of communication means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, usually organic, system that uses preserved seeds from the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximizing crop yields.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures share individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel themselves to be representatives of society’s standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a set of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who by negligence, as a result of misfortune, or as a result of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "ferals" or savages. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have experienced severe violence or trauma before abandonment or flight.
Other children may have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while the scaffold goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning mode, but rather an aid for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is the little staple-shaped assistant of Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, solicit and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee them nourishment, care and training, but happens to them.
We believe that childcare is a safe area for these children.
Our foster system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The trust is supposed to meet all unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord’s (1998) study of public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation: “personal engagement” and “continuous relationships.”
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay “The President’s Speech,” Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability: hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the back-and-forth variability between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to satisfy its need for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savanna.
In addition, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, in the end, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in a way that chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep disruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during the normal period of sleep, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice by using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness without fully waking up.
If you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include drinking plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is hindered only by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It has a foundation in Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the fulcrum of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic conflicts, procedural and cultural, caused the break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies; thus began the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans proved obsolete, however, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to guarantee the country the safeguard of its ability to move people and goods, while counteracting the same ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples supporting this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans tried to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They began to be bred by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to have easily available milk, fleece, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually raised in flocks left free to move on the hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply made up of parallel wooden axes, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses that traveled along them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossbars were introduced relatively early to keep the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would have been more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron ones. In 1767 the first rails made their appearance completely in iron.
The first means of transport that man knew were the legs. Humans began to walk in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means "erect man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not usually walk erect.
Specialization signs for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent future suffering we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If instead we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and turn it off.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were produced, today known as "The Dunlap Posters".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the assignment was given to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on 9 July, while a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 borders of Dunlap still known are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that resemble dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become human parasites.
Both killer bedbugs and bedbugs are nest bedbugs, that is, adapted to live in their host's nest or dwelling.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) has about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that the odds of developing MS among females are twice as high as among males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own interest, or that of their child.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the natural parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides in fact most scientific inquiry.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations allows to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, relative to most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
Mutations that can be passed on to children are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Naturalistic tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and the study of ecosystem information.
For example by visiting, photographing and getting to know the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns to drive to work, crossing paths with other people whose workplace is where they just left.
In this dynamic back-and-forth, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stable conditions that has enabled human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or broken bridges.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
"Traffic Flow" is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers’ behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable constancy and can be represented generically in a mathematical way.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables have been correlated: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small canyons to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist nowadays, the only ones that are not able to fold their wings are the dragonflies and the ephemeral ones.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which makes sense, because we don't feel like the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
20% of the water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, in which the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries flow.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanting by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City consists of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These in fact resemble more the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could get to the point at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never has to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only ask ourselves what fate the keyboard will have when something new comes along.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis for the operation of the fission bomb.
It's basically like rolling a heavy trolley up a hill, so by further splitting the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This has facilitated the rise of lava to the surface.
Content theories are focused on researching what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and drive them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most common content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers begin to lead their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, put into practice disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager turns into a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the entire team and make it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with a few small differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as meetings can take place depending on various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The “invisible team” is defined as the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the will to face the long process that leads to building a learning organization? A good reason to implement organizational learning concepts may be innovation.
When you can use all available resources effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists’ research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors can affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong sci-fi connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computing that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes building machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as writing, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Trips are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that are not reachable by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual excursions. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but earlier versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students’ writing, as their early experiences with blogging are often marked by poor grammar and spelling, but typically the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative reviews the author of the blog is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them". The need to nurture the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
Proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the evocative and bilingual capital of Canada, full of art galleries and museums that tell the story of the country’s past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoilt beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The larger areas to the north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wilderness.
If you make a population comparison, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States, the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxury seaside resorts, are mostly independent or associated nations with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travellers: it is recommended that all of them declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they see as harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenidians.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city that was called Daru l-Badya, later named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Across Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of chinchallery, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to document well before making any visits outside Goma, in order to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for the climb to the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see the mountain gorillas of Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (taxi-motorcycle) to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctù" ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a decayed city, but for its reputation remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
In Henry Louis Gates' special "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stops.
With its more Arab than African touch, the city stands out from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, to the north bordering Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park includes 14 different ecozones, each of which provides a livelihood for a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily contributions for conservation and entrance to the park.
Buying a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar graph, even more noticeable because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon in front.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development has focused on the densely populated reclaimed lands of the northern coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal range of mangroves in the world. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of forest included in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; the area is estimated to contain 400 Bengal royal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to get to nearby places, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two pillars have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the vertical free space is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully functional.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that lived in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived on hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its identity and native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, at the Las Cañitas polo courts, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches also at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The Falkland Islands have their official currency, the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands. In Stanley you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted on the outlying islands, although UK and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely get below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/meter from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meter from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not maintaining an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals adequate space since they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that odors can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there was the notorious naval stall of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the Pacific Ocean of the North Shore (in the North Harbour District) extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can swim safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have many French wines, but Australian and New Zealand wines could cope better with the journey.
The local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the 'flat white' coffee comes from a foreign idea. The 'espresso' is the short black coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on the same level as Belgian. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Many excursions on the coral reef are made throughout the year and injuries to one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow the directions and pay special attention to security alerts.
Cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear it and tend to keep themselves at a distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not living them actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even flight+hotel combination packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents needed for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on site, considering this a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and win a space near the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since crossing the ice causes rather annoying noise for those who are most exposed.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa waiver (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase as much as possible the time and money spent by their guests. Typically, there are neither windows nor clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests’ moods high so they can hold on.
In some places alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, the state of intoxication alters the ability to judge and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as when you are on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, in no time can fall so much snow that you get stuck.
Precipitation and snow gusts, or the formation of ice or condensation on the windows of the vehicle, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa’s biggest tourist attraction and the focus of many visitors’ holidays.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips made by land, particularly in the savannah, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, the first of which took place in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary between them, however most of the cancellation policies related to the coronavirus, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The cost of most event tickets is expected to be between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, while regular tickets will cost around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can make drying easier. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like to wear ironed socks, you can try it with a hairdryer, if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are several ways to sanitize water, and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of water packaged inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not widespread in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmit poison or infection.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force are usually not qualified as harmful animals.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy excise and tax-free products in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that has the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas among the vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes wide open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits exposed are much lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (normally 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile phone service is much higher than that present in other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are somewhat tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring southern Austria.
Fruit cakes are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German bakery cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who want to taste small but rich in flavor can orient themselves on what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either “dry” or “wet”, depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is normally used for curries in the inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is most commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially the Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are support for the rider's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but may present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider's feet remain stuck there.
If a jockey is jumped by a horse but has a foot stuck in the bracket, he could be dragged by the running horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
For one thing, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially those in England, have inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where there are a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continually trace new paths on its walls, potentially endless.
Snow sports in the downhill, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and include slipping on the snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts multiple enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums" (ski bums), who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing activity in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Ski hiking: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or trekking on skis.
It is connected, although usually does not include them, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover distances somewhat longer than those covered by walking, but only very rarely will you reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on steep slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through more countries you would have to apply for a visa and go through passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather like a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to pass passport checks again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider it an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition has geographical differences with respect to the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Crafts could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade is based is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding; some lived on fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mostly as work animals.
Today many Sámi practice modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a traveler’s warning is issued for the destination you will be visiting, there may be consequences to your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are targeted at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are simply a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that may result in damage, severe social distress or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, rainfall above the norm and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea thunderstorms and cyclones.
Among the weather phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity are storms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone who plans to visit a potentially sizeable country such as a war zone must undergo vocational training.
Searching on the Internet 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A course typically lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers who plan to have sex change surgery abroad must ensure that they have valid return travel documents with them.
The intention of governments to issue passports with no indication of sex (X) or up-to-date documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Inspections at security checkpoints also became much more scrupulous in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Transgender people in the preoperative phase should not expect to pass checks without their privacy and dignity being affected.
The rift currents are formed by the return flow of waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the submarine topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue in attempting to swim against the current, which may prove impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, going back to swimming will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to locate an area where you don’t risk being trapped again, or consider whether to wait for rescue, based on your abilities and whether you’ve been spotted.
The return shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (there being a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture, sometimes have difficulty readapting to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the uses of your home culture.
In the first experience abroad, you are likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travelers to a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were necessary even for those who return to their homeland.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is the most interesting thing there is in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, sixteen of which are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water from a magnificent natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is the region that lies to the south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4,892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a mobile phone, because to call you have to be outdoors with the view clear to the satellite.
The service is often used by recreational boats, including recreational boats, as well as missions that require remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly prevalent among new graduates, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year can actually increase your chances of resuming higher education upon returning to your home country.
Usually enrolling in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, inside the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland’s national pastime, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For the descent ashore you will not need a separate visa (from 2009) using the onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, also the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can scare people of all ages and any condition, especially if they have never flown before or had any traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear of what is unknown, or of not having control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some routes, larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would have taken days for unloading and customs.
The only way to make it arrive faster would be to ship it as checked baggage. And this is where you come into play, since airline regulations do not allow you to ship baggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or business class the most obvious way is to pay a nice amount for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do it).
However, the price to be paid is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal cheap fare for business trips and up to eleven times the fare for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and as a result they apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has been the scene of ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christian.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation hub.
The ancient city of Izmir spreads over a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and is currently a modern, evolved and active commercial center.
Although the city breathes an atmosphere more like that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with characteristic red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a singular octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant tale of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The bus line Scotturb 403 regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and it has an almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who have survived these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or made them work to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid misrepresenting these places by staining the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority is able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Although this is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to feel good in Paris continues to be to behave at your best, relating as a "bien élevé" (well educated) person. This will definitely facilitate your movements.
The rough outward appearance of Parisians will quickly fade if you show off some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mostly beech, peach and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels it presents a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the cedar rooster live in these places, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long trousers down to their knees.
Even these can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each wearer, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, a one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "You", always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This probably also makes reading easier, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantiated form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are the c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the following vowel.
Also be sure to pronounce differently "r" and "rr": dear means beloved, while wagon means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and often regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and phrase comprehension.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language can come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore does not need to be studied separately.
Nowadays, premodern observatories are obsolete and serve as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution in their golden age did not represent a problem as it is today, they are usually placed in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes intended for research are huge structures in remote areas where weather conditions are favorable.
Admiration of cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum flowering was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to tour; you can buy just about anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the paths of hiking trails and well-known bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions related to this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
It is a tradition to spend the night of Easter staying awake in an outdoor place to admire the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations behind this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches, an Easter Vigil is frequently celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands arrived swimming, flying or floating.
As the distance from the mainland was considerable, the mammals could not cope with the journey. This caused the giant turtle to become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility of witnessing the Northern Lights, because the sky remains dark almost all day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be accustomed to.
Office clothing is normally made up of jacket and tie or suit and is addressed to colleagues with the surname or professional title.
Harmony in the workplace is of crucial importance, as it gives importance to the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers are often required to receive the assent of their superiors to every decision, and they are expected to follow instructions without asking questions.
