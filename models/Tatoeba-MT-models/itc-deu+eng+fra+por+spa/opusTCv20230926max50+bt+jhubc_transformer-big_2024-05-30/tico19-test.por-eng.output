Rapidly progressive cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare more for an outbreak of COVID-19 patients who will need care and especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a portion of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assess trends in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and in the United Kingdom and compare them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of that country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, with between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative numbers and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the country’s Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, is updated every day at 8am.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them to those in Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day cumulative truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases notified by each country until March 15, 2020 at 8am, and compared with Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the 14-day cumulative truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed those in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and increased significantly thereafter around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increasing trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
By 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks or less ago.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems, and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for updating.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive treatment, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalisation for COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or an ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data with a focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 between 2010 and 2011).
Modeled scenarios related to the saturation of health system capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a 90% higher risk of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases so far have been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical assistance, mainly intensive care, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the predicted rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to properly understand, accept and adapt their actions if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures for mitigating the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to step up their control initiatives to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people, and men more than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the rapidly developing research object.
We will deal with the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope this study will help in understanding and eradicating this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to remain confined on the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus bears great similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was designated SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the respective disease was designated CoV-19 (COVID-19) disease.
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients dead.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “public enemy number one,” and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequencing of the virus isolated from several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we find twice highly pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, current COVID-19 is the third CoV epidemic in documented human history.
As shown in Fig.1.1, a portion of cases of pneumonia with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019, to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequencing was published.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan’s first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, contagion from health professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of the onset of the contagion by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread to China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
As the situation rapidly worsens, the size and final severity of the epidemic will still have to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, some were under 20, and only 14 infected were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in groups, mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The baseline number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people grew exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the mass transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single strand of RNA with a certain sense.
They can be divided into four genera, namely: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike glycoprotein (S) binds to its cellular receptors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and, in sequence, membrane fusion occurs.
The genome of the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultra-thin sections of the human airway epithelium.
Human ECA2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein S binds to human ECA2 protein weaker than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 contains no known domain or functional motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ECA2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for recognition and CoV infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening for drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans by civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs of SARS-like bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross species barriers and infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission has yet to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes carry the virus from bats to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that pangolins, elongated muzzle mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the genetic homology of 99% between a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a big difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete tests are expected (Fig.
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are, for the most part, still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are efficient in deactivating the virus.
Overall, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only consult previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host’s innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptor (TLR), NOD-type receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-type receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated immune system reaction generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, affects the elderly with comorbidities and pregnant women more.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a higher chance of being infected than other people.
The average estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days and most often 3-7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, demonstrates that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people who do not show symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to or infected with the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended by 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come on its own or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of disease symptoms.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without imaging abnormalities of the lung, should be screened for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family grouping and a grouping with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients required ventilatory support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which is the highest mortality rate of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnoea (40% to 42%), diarrhea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Comparatively, SARS mortality as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic number of reproduction R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4, only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in relation to their symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table Table1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same crowd or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without presenting symptoms, and cured patients who have been discharged from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm for prolonged quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte counts below 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Enzyme and myoglobin levels in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of the degradation of fibrin present in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities in the chest X-ray are present in most patients with COVID-19, and present irregular bilateral shadows or opacity in frosted glass in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARSD).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely compromise gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most severe chest X-ray results usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumotics, the formation of the hyaline membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncytial cells into the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which went on to be derived not only from RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 x 10-18 mol/L at 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter input) using a complex measuring rod at less than one hour.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors can provide, to the best of their ability, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed previously for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ACE2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high-flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified alternative cardiopulmonary technique used for the treatment of severe heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that the cytokine cascade results from the exacerbated immune system reaction in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat the cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include modulation of the T-cell-targeted immune response; blockade of IFN-y, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; cytokine signaling suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
They can cause serious side effects, mainly avascular osteonecrosis, drastically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of corticosteroid treatment at low to moderate doses have been recommended for cautious use in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, it was found that intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-strand RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct some tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are long awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and generation of antibodies
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
In fact, cured patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who were cured of COVID-19, and was injected into 10 severely ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with the reduction of inflammation and viral loads, and the improvement of oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be cautiously considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is large to treat patients in a severe state.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat an epidemic of global proportion.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or to screen for effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or are vague, as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The best cure rates of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, achieved the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and for hospitalization was considerably shorter in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than in the group treated by Western medicine alone.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than for the group treated only by Western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than in the group treated only by Western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of MTC still await further properly controlled testing at larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or with suspicion of the disease feel, in general, great fear of the highly contagious disease and that it can be fatal, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
What’s more, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, symptoms of psychosis, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of the public health system’s actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people with suspicion of the disease and people who have had contact with them, as well as the general population, who are in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives have been taken to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before the start of a clinical trial.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months, on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognostic model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33):
Age: age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive care (mean age 66 versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive treatment are more likely to suffer acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ECA2-positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have a strong correlation and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or injury in the tissue and has been proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the level of CRP with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also assist in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are expressively present in various organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunctions.
Primary clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues for the prediction of outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants typically used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Considering that a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low dosage and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainties, and witness the deaths of loved family members and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the early stage of infection (or causes only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early phase or in the incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty for the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are severely ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Major efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population, in the hope of halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have dramatically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic will end by March, and the slowdown phase will last between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and middle horn smears of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the newly identified virus may become a cyclical influenza-like episode.
However, promising indications have occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally kept under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, may become weaker in infectivity and, at some point, become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and that of MERS is found below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing and sneezing, and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which generates a new possibility: that of oral-fecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater precaution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, co-workers, and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to decrease the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent droplets of fluid from a potentially infected individual from being carried in the air or sticking to the surfaces of objects, where they can infect others.
However, only N95 masks (<0x23>1860s series) protect against inhalation of viruses with sizes from 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the viruses being able to fully penetrate it; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and both are approximately 85 nm in size.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (<0x23>1860s series) masks, but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should wear insulation bathrobes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent face protectors or goggles when attending to patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay home in isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to decrease the risk of infection, as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a major alert for China, based on its recent history with the 2003 SARS epidemic.
However, only on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of contagion and limited reproductivity among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message made people more relaxed, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for containment of the disease in Wuhan on a minimal scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public pronouncements, since everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information coming from hospitals, rather than expecting formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its initial stage; and (3) be more responsive to the public.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a sense of return from SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rate is also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are severely ill, which makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a genetic homologue of 96% has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs of SARS-like bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates in bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut off transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may reoccur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or have a seasonal recurrence like the flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and to so many others.
However, regardless of the efforts required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, it was known that two human CoVs (HCoVs) caused a mild illness, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed what was thought about CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 highlighted CoVS again and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of enormous use.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for disease prevention in humans.
Investigation of host interactions of CoV in animals may also provide important information about the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of existing information about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that of comparison and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current epidemic of the 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Moreover, the requirements for an effective transition between hosts and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of encapsulated, positive polarity viruses and single-stranded RNA.
These viruses that present the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses were named "CoVs" due to their coronal morphology when observed under an electron microscope.
As for structure, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two overlapping open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessory proteins are also encoded by different CoV lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the genus betaCoV contains the majority of HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
The HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from coriza from patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating today and has infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts, with important implications in the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlighted and discussed the common theme that parental viruses of HCoVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the trend of evolution of HCoV, in which the increase in transmissibility is usually accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of strain B814 of HCoV-229E from coryza from patients who contracted the common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat, and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superspreaders", it was estimated that each contaminated person can contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, liver dysfunction and elevated creatine kinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased number of macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients require, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy from a relative of patient zero traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found that the virus was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered all over the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, it was reported that HCoV-HKU1 was associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is, therefore, quite peculiar to MERS, among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high confirmed case-related mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to man.
Halfway through the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which was known retrospectively to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and also named the COVID-19 disease.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a gross confirmed case-related mortality rate of 3.4%.
It is noted that the lethality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside that city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as does SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with the presence of fever, cough, and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they group into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they may contribute to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease progression are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCoVs acquired on a community basis (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presence of non-specific, mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting patterns, both in community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCoVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it must be confirmed if the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies whether oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can exhibit seasonality, as in cases of HCoVs acquired in a community fashion.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after its passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All HCoVs acquired by community mode that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop serious diseases of HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize restriction factors.
The longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance of the virus adapting to humans.
If the adaptation is adequate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, the four community-acquired CoVs have circulated in human populations, causing common colds in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and take advantage of the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as HCoVs acquired on a community basis, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It has yet to be discovered whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbors a direct relation ancestor, sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well-adapted and not pathogenic in this host.
Likewise, a reservoir host harbors the HCoV continuously and long-lastingly.
In both cases, the hosts are infected naturally and are the natural hosts of the HCoV or its parental virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adequately adapt to the new host, and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifying host, allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
An HCoV may have the infection interrupted if it cannot sustain its transmission to the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the slaughter of all civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild or farmed masked palm civets without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could be only the amplifying intermediate host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals may serve as intermediate hosts amplifiers of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, named SARS-related Rhinolophus bat HKU3 CoV (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese ferret bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other CoVs of bats share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoVs, other than designated WIV1, can be isolated as live viruses.
The human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from fecal samples from bats has been shown to use ECA2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
It is intriguing that the serum of convalescent SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 in bats and CoV-HKU5 in bats.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences are phylogenetically closer to the betaCoV homologs of identified bats in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, in the same way that camels from the Middle East in several African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from nasal smears of camels, increasing the evidence that camels serve as the legitimate host reservoir of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that usually mild symptoms, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is remarkable that infected camels transmit viruses not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus transmission in bats.
However, there are still no answers, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels before the appearance of symptoms, which can be plausibly attributed to transmission between people or to transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that harbor MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a Bat CoV RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless nearly identical CoVs of bats are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be configured between wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Sea Fruit Wholesale Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of transmission from animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small, endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbor ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also directly related to RaTG13, with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They cluster in SARS-CoV-2-like virus underlines in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In a huge contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 DLRs are more divergent, although they exhibit a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study on sick pangolin also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences from lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual curation to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of pangolin SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 related betaVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related betaVs of pangolins.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolin and other mammals has yet to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest broad genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of pangolin betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 stems from convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A contrary argument counts in favor of the recombination between betaCoV of SARS-CoV-2-related pangolins and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat CoVs, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a CoV of bats called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American tricolor bat had a direct relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also suspicion that camelids are its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the current knowledge on the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs from closely related bats to HCoV-229E were discovered.
Among them, there is an alpaca alphaCoV.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of bat virus to humans.
First, humans, but not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, alphaCoVs from HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphaCoV caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphaCoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain HCoV-229E-related alphaCoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as the genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by later results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, colonies with high density, narrow social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV in dromedaries dates back decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and sustains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and humans remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, as its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolin.
They may be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the amplifying intermediate hosts, in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is needed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single strand RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average rate of substitution of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the stage of CoV adaptation to new hosts.
CoVs have review mechanism exoribonuclease, the exclusion of which results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even infeasibility.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remdesivir suppresses CoV replication by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the mutation rate is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host who maintains contact with humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large genome of RNA in CoVs exerts an extra plasticity in modifying the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and encoded protein functions relative to the last three inches of the end of the genome.
Third, CoVs exchange models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a single "copy choice" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing container, tape swapping frequently occurs during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs, such as SL-CoV from bats and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV isolates, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the DLR of protein S.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in amino acids 318o to 510o in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ECA2 as well as its co-receptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV DLR is capable of recognizing the ECA2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, mice, and raccoon dogs, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from human and civet viral isolates in the DLR, and four of them are located in the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein's interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the binding affinity of its S protein to human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electron cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times greater of this bond than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be helpful to determine if any other co-receptors may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
It is intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the S protein.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They could also respond for the effective adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence on the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp the dependency factors with the host and subvert the host restriction factors for effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
Non-biased screening with genome-wide reach of host dependence and constraint factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but they were found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A nucleotide 29 exclusion characteristic of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains early in the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs lineages, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV has undergone recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from the relief of selection pressure exerted on viruses, such as pressure from the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, alpaca alphaCoV presents a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a change in frames.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure on their reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bats are likely to be well adapted to the CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94, and the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen species (REOs) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress CoV replication and affect exorbibonuclease review, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or cause, at most, mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without provoking a high immune response from the host.
This document explains the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of severe cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytokine cascade, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was turned off from CoV replication.
The same strategy of shutting down the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of interferon type I in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflasome in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it was found that betaCoV from bats shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a CoV from bats that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that civets and other animals in markets harbor SARS-CoV-identical viruses, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 were not identified.
Pangolin betaCoVs, with high homology to SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that pangolin may serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or pangolin betaCoVs may contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by man accidentally or intentionally.
CoVs have returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human-to-human transmission.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civets in markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolin should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple betaCoV lineages of pangolin closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it will still need to be clarified in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and how this transmission occurs.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in the wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To halt recurrent MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach must be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, the CoVs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the crisis of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better response and preparedness plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats exhibit many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people will be in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for people to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolin, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolin could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, pangolin, or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parental viruses are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance guide for diagnosing and treating the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. This guide conveys our experience and is a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant discoveries of research and experiences in clinical practice; because of this, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria of “suspect case” and “confirmed case” according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guides (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially referred to as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted great attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant discoveries of research and experiences in clinical practice; because of this, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guides published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020 feature a total of seven editions with substantial changes in context in some.
Our guide now received a comment from Zhou et al., who submitted a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We endorse your meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs updating according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guides (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm the suspicious case, it is necessary to combine an item of the epidemiological history elements with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to comply with three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with previous fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or in other areas.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging capabilities of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count exhibiting normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the initial stage of symptom onset.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) PCR-positive screening for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing exhibiting high homogeneity in relation to known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive for SAG-specific IgM and IgG-negative antibodies on SARS-CoV-2 increase in serum-specific Ig-change;
We can note that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples was added to the second and third edition (of January 18 and 22, 2020, respectively).
Pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth editions (from January 27, 2020, and February 8, 2020, respectively), and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the ongoing work of researchers in search of an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us to pay attention to symptomatic and asymptomatic atypical patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more studies and clinical practices.
To conclude, we expect the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that you check and comply with the latest guidelines of your home countries.
Our team will also timely update our guide to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online newscast, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic on March 11.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, one of the local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video online statement, Bengali Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be paralyzed longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
This shutdown of public transport began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
By March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infections in the world exceeded one million, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea said it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections until Thursday.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there have been more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to be paid without attending work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew to the entire day in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Shops in Australia reduce toilet paper limits per transaction
On Saturday night and Sunday, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced toilet paper purchase restrictions, respectively, to two packages and one package per transaction at all stores across the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a one-pack limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
For fear of COVID-19, buyers were reportedly stockpiling in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases with home delivery to one package per order.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packets per transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that even with the four-pack restriction, “many stores are still depleting inventory less than an hour after delivery” and called the demand “unprecedented,” while ALDI called it “unexpected” in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had a “sharp increase” last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco’s store in Canberra also limited the allowable amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered extra inventory, while ALDI made stocks available in advance of a promotion planned for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but that local board restrictions on the frequency of truck deliveries make it difficult.
It expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to carry out the promotion on Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores replenish inventory every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that, when depleted, it leaves many empty spaces on the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the view that if there were an abundant amount on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be [purchased] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they would run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au.
Real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to first-time auction bidders in Melbourne, as fewer auctions were being held with buyers entering on the extended Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printout by Darwin, included an eight-page insert intended to be trimmed and used as toilet paper.
Initially, the stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of toilet paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — is a pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO emphasized the need to urge governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, it is an “unprecedented” pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that “aside from influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been monitored from onset to continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we have never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus."
“We have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the outbreak, “in short, will get worse.”
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuing 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared an international public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people away, and monitoring and isolation of people with suspected infection.
Authorities around the world have responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and the closure of establishments.
The pandemic has provoked a severe global socioeconomic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic-triggered purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance and others from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia due to unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
In large part, the cases were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
The outbreak-causing virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has a close link to bat, pangolin and SARS-CoV coronaviruses. The first person with symptoms known to have become ill on December 1, 2019 and had no visible connections with the subsequent seafood market group.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two-thirds had a connection to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that one case pointed to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei province, who may have been the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that as new reported cases decreased in China, but suddenly increased by Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases first surpassed the number of cases outside China.
There may be a significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 and under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK’s leading scientific advisor, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection in 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic number of reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over the age of 60 and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and who had tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, since it may not include people who have died without taking the test, for example, who have died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that “we know that [the official death toll] is underestimated,” a statement corroborated by episodic reports of underreporting in the U.S. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan, Jan.
The first death outside China occurred on Feb. 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on Feb. 14.
By February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and by the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.104) by April 10, 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the fatality coefficient have fallen from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms between January 1–10, 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die due to a disease.
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific population of infection through case resolution.
Some academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall infection lethality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: “Without proper control, infectious epidemics usually reach their peak and then go into decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it’s almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when this will occur.”
The Chinese government’s senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, argued that “it can end by June” if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will likely remain in circulation for a year or two.”
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary “until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it’s highly transmissible” and “it could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year.”
The virulence of the recurrence will depend on the group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretion (catharsis), loss of olfactory sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms are difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips with blue coloration. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The evolution of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute and septic respiratory discomfort syndrome, if
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but with test results that confirm the infection, therefore, the researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a person with confirmed infection be monitored and examined closely to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the ratio of asymptomatics range from some to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between onset of infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost olfactory sensation was initially 30% and subsequently dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and by small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or talking, the close contact being considered from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause the droplets to reach from 15 feet to 27 feet.
Some people have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing droplets may also be produced during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally in suspension.
The droplets can land in the mouths and noses of nearby people or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in airborne propagation.
Spread can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches one’s own eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the stool, it is believed that the risk of this happening is low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact-tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to humans, however British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus resemble those of coronavirus related in its nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
The genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B). Two strains of this same lineage are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, at the whole genome level, to other coronavirus samples from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the entire genome, so far, has found a maximum of 92% sharing of genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolin are the intermediate host.
Infection with the virus can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms, but the definitive confirmation is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or computed tomography (CT).
A study done in Wuhan comparing rRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its imaging characteristics coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CT be not used for screening or as a front-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.”
The WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available from a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is performed on nasopharyngeal smear, although throat smear is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these had been shown to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Particularities of X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging of symptomatic people include asymmetrical peripheral frosted glass opacities and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an international online database of imaging results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as that by adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with those of PCR and showed that, although the image is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as an investigative tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed for the detection of virus imaging characteristics with X-rays and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent disease transmission include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper handkerchief, and placing this handkerchief directly in a waste container.
Anyone who has been infected is advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential travel going to or coming from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some community members do not know where or how they were infected. Health professionals who care for individuals who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
Governments’ use of mobile location data for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some incorrect concepts about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as, for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwashes, which has already proven ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working to develop one.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty. They should also wash their hands before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective cloak.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol, when there is no soap and water readily available.
The WHO advises you to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (up to one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% iodopovidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in a location, such as an office or a daycare center, all areas such as offices, toilets, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering your mouth and nose with a folded elbow or paper tissue when coughing or sneezing, and immediately discarding any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of displacement of expiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing, or coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The use of masks can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the largest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene."
The WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing the masks can help people not touch their own faces.
In several countries, the use of face masks by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face mask made of cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming into close contact with another person (stay 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a surgical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand’s health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering your nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that everyone wear a face mask when going out in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone who enters supermarkets must wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents have been asked to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has required passengers on intercity trains and buses to wear face masks from April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to wear a face mask when going out on the street. At the same time, it is recommended to produce masks at home for those who cannot buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the transmission of the disease, through the reduction of close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping centers.
Social distancing methods can be applied by everyone by staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping distance from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in a region) to 50 people and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face a higher risk of serious illnesses and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible physical contact with "community epidemic". By the end of March 2020, the WHO and other organs of health care are in contact with "social"
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to implications that social isolation was needed altogether rather than encouraging contact by other alternative means.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those who suspect they have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have required or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive self-quarantine instructions were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with large-scale transmission were advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
Containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as present other measures of infection control and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are made to reduce it: the measures taken now serve to slow the spread and reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time, in combination.
Suppression calls for more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic at a basic reproductive rate of less than 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. This is called "flattening the epidemic curve".
Thus, the risk of overloading health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not of a pharmaceutical nature and that can manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of face masks and self-quarantine; community measures that aim at physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of events that lead to agglomerations.
Other countries have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, presented the mass screening and localized quarantines. In addition, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, those infected received financial support when they self-quarantined, and for those who did not, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there has been an increase in the production of face masks and those who stockpile medical supplies have been punished. Simulations conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States show that reducing (decreasing the speed of contagion, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppressing (i.e. reversing the growth of the epidemic) present great challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half, yet this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, while overwhelming health systems.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it must be maintained as long as the virus is circulating through the human population or until a vaccine is available, if this occurs earlier. Otherwise, transmission occurs again as soon as the measures are relaxed.
A long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug that is specific to COVID-19. There are, however, efforts towards drug development, which include testing existing drugs.
Using cold medicines that do not require a prescription, drinking plenty of fluids and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, it may be necessary to use oxygen therapy, intravenous insertion of fluids or respiratory aid.
The use of steroids can make the condition worse.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also stated that some “homemade and traditional” medicines can alleviate the symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs brought about by COVID-19 as key measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to move, at various levels, their capabilities, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the cancellation of non-compulsory care procedures and the increase of the separation and isolation of patients with positive test for COVID-19.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus dates from December 1, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to Huanan’s seafood wholesale market. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian’s next report, in the Hospital Provincial of Hubei.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a “SARS-type coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by police for spreading fake news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December issued a statement to the population and informed the WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, facilitated by the Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub, as well as a main rail connection point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed the symptoms by January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy, with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have already had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The reactions of the countries included containment measures, such as quarantines (also known as house arrest orders, house arrest orders or lockdown) and curfews. As of April 2, some 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are somehow confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in Africa, more than 1 million people are confined in the Philippines, and around 59 million people are confined in the Philippines.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were already under some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case, on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26. Her hospital reported the Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control on December 27.
Initial genetic tests, on December 27, 2019, in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a coronavirus of the type SARS.
A statement to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was notified on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan doctors were warned by police for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed there was no “clear evidence” of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping as a “people’s war” to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as “the largest quarantine in human history,” a sanitary cordon was announced on January 23 to interrupt round trips to or from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations on January 25 have been cancelled in several locations.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to serve more patients.
Along with newly built hospitals, China converted another 14 Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals such as convention centers and stadiums. On January 26, the government launched more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health statements for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Restrictions on travel were made in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport was modified, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Public movement control has been applied in several cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have undergone some sort of exit restriction. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “importation” of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all international travelers arriving in the city. On March 23, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in this case through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China’s Foreign Minister announced on March 26, 2020 that the entry of individuals with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details on when this policy will be terminated.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to companies. The State Council declared a day of mourning, beginning with a moment of three minutes of silence across the country, on April 4 at 10 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked the families to avoid a new on-line observance of COD-19.
On January 20, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country’s national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on Feb. 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
It is suspected that the Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On February 22, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert level on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on February 29.
All of South Korea’s military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The schedule of the airlines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world in terms of screening the population for the virus. The country also isolated the infected people and tracked and quarantined those who come into contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory individual symptom reporting for those arriving from international travel via a mobile app, drive-through virus testing, with results available the next day, and increased testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it has not quarantined entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment under allegations of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was announced that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with virus testing from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Feb. 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantined areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities before the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
Amid allegations of covering up the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their cases related to Iran on Feb. 28 indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The agency said there is a higher risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions such as detention centers, which also suffer from a lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number since the outbreak began in the country.
At least 12 serving politicians or retirees and government officials died from the disease by March 17.
As of March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the Coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five times more cases in Iran than is being reported.
It is suggested that U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country’s financial ability to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be eased for the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, “In the outbreak areas, people are forbidden to enter and leave.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On March 4, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities across the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, have to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding screening protocols that could be employed.
On March 19, Italy passed China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 pandemic-related deaths.
On March 22, it was reported that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical supplies to Italy.
As of April 5, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with the majority of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus up to that time may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the mildest of the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a consequence, the government received criticism for its acknowledged lack of diligence and intensity in its response to the problems faced by the population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement advising the interruption of all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work from home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and academies should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay 80% of workers’ wages up to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distancing measures, preventing crowds with more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activities to the minimum necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, these restrictions have been reinforced by the police through the issuance of fines and dispersion of agglomerations.
Most businesses received orders to close, with exceptions for businesses deemed "essential," including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and car workshops.

Despite having done so, the United States had a slow start to testing, which concealed the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The testing was marked by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal government approval for test kits that were not government-owned (from academies, businesses, and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested by the beginning of March (a medical request was subsequently required).
As of Feb. 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

On the other hand, China’s aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government “provided regular updates to avoid panic about the festivities in the lunar new year.”
On January 23, in reaction to the decision of the main authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that certainly was not a recommendation of the WHO" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On January 30, after the confirmation of the transmission between humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases by the WHO's International Health Organization (H).
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the PHEIC was invoked because of the “risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and travel."
On 5 February, the WHO called on the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency of assisting those countries that “do not have systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, and even if it arises.”
Tedros later made statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community "to invest now or will have to pay later". On 11 February, the WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros declared that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to provide "the power of the entire UN system in response".
The United Nations Crisis Management Team has been activated as a result, allowing for the coordination of the entire United Nations response, which WHO says will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies can come in with their expertise in the social, economic and developmental implications resulting from the outbreak.”
On February 14, a Joint WHO Mission Team with China was empowered to provide international and WHO-based experts in China with assistance in domestic management and assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through workshops and meetings with key national level institutions and conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities on the levels of provinces and municipalities, including urban and rural settings" by stating that it was possible for the world to "prepare" itself.
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the global Coronavirus threat assessment would be elevated from "high" to "very high", is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that “This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready,” insisting that the right response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan further stated that the current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean that “we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the Coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said the WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction". The WHO faced many criticisms for what was seen as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a petition to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to file his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts declared that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the government is responsible.
The group emphasized that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, people with mental problems, homeless people, those living in extreme poverty, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups that need government help.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to address the effects of confinement and restrictions on travel, the digital hub includes a Country Policy Tracker, which helps countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo Bolsonaro for managing the pandemic, which began in China’s Hubei province.
Administrators at the provincial level of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been fired because of their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public anger over the Coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, have rejected an early recognition of the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the “Chinese Virus” or “Wuhan Virus” saying China’s censorship “super-feeded a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which was in turn condemned by some critics as racism and “a way of deflecting administration failure to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast got from a U.S. government cable a detailed communication ploy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being quoted as “This has all to do with China.
"Channels such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of propaganda for global influence.
The head of foreign policy of the European Union, Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a biased point of view and 'policies of generosity'".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and trustworthy partner."
China has also asked the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending aid to those same countries.
The Jack Ma donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. officials have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations into their own country.
And he hears disputes related to masks reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey confiscated hundreds of fans destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticised the European Union’s lack of solidarity with those affected by the Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “Only China has responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous “high-level political source” as saying that 80 percent of Russia’s supplies were “useless or of little use to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good phase, they would also act reciprocally if necessary.”
The planned NATO military exercise “Defender 2020” in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO’s largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be maintained on a reduced scale.
The Secretary General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about a dozen ex-political or ex-political members of parliament infected, as well as here
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders, calling for help on March 14, 2020, saying his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social health policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, public leave for high paid, and
Political analysts have anticipated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected as president in the 2020 election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan’s ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated locations.
South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment of what they have called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising his response. The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those deemed to have spread false news about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The Coronavirus outbreak has been to blame for several cases of supply shortages, stemming from increased use of equipment globally to combat the outbreaks, panic-motivated purchases, and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and supplier interruptions.
Several locations also experienced the panic-driven shopping event which led to empty shelves of essentials such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortages of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warning about delays in shipping electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protective equipment has risen 100-fold.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays in the supply of medical items by four to six months.
This has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that it would put workers’ health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of baby formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared an acute food shortage.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the storage and illegal trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding the acute food shortages that have been predicted in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production did not see a large reduction, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released reserves of pork to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to maintain reserves for such emergencies.
A harm to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China was badly hit in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%.
As Mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist’s intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges about possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic repercussion of the epidemic on global growth could outpace the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated a $300 billion impact on the world’s supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly “confused” after a sharp decline in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on Feb. 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside Mainland China.
On Feb. 27, due to growing concerns about the Coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock market indices including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones industry average demonstrated their most significant falls since 2008, with the Dow falling by 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three other indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10 percent.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China’s sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again based on concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest fall on March 16.
Many see a likely economic downturn.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including sights, and the recommendation of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry has been at an unprecedented level.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major travel station associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year’s festivals, with private companies also independently closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass crowding, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities have extended the New Year holiday to February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen by this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its level of infectious disease response to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to dealers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Resellers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping centers around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check buyers’ temperatures, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers were abandoned at home in inland provinces or imprisoned in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government help.
The Coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Confinement in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily remuneration) unemployed Spain workers since March. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that some 44% of Canadian households went through unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment aid and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit program. Nearly half a million companies in Germany put their workers under government-subsidized short-time work programs known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-time work pay scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as people – both employed and independent – globally.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and help artists where possible.
In March 2020, museums, bookshops, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and highly accelerating repercussion of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion events.
The Vatican announced that the rites of Holy Week in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have advised older Christians to stay home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live streaming online or television while others offer drive-in services.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter’s Square empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran’s health ministry announced Friday’s prayers were cancelled in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as their residents from entering holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled for a date after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021". Casinos and other game venues around the world have been closed and in-person poker tournaments have also been postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with several music groups suspending or canceling their tours.
Many big theaters like Broadway have also cancelled all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live-streaming shows or creating online “festivals” for artists to perform, share and disseminate their work.
Online, several memes on the internet about the coronavirus are spread, as many seek humor and entertainment amid uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism directed at people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people from focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, mistrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February results (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserving the virus or being given a fair punishment for what they provoked.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is targeted at those in the areas affected by the virus.
After the advancing outbreak in new focus countries, citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pressing for a ban on Chinese entry into their countries.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan went to Twitter’s Trending Topics.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeast India, which borders China, and students in major Indian cities reportedly suffered persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the unit in the state of Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that is why God turned against them.”
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called it "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign garbage" and targets of "discarding".
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them from some or all coverage of the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors made available scientific articles related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (sorology) can be used for population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who became asymptomatic.
An accurate rate of disease mortality and herd immunity level in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests conducted in countries.
This variability probably still substantially affects the mortality rates of the recorded cases, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal smear or saliva sample.
Results usually become available within a few hours or in 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharyngeal smear is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, sample material can be removed from the bottom of the respiratory tract by suction catheter or material expelled by sputum (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It searches for the public "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp laboratory gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive approval for emergency use from the National Medical Products Administration of China for the SARS-CoV-2 detection kit CORONAVIRUS INTERNATIONAL CORONAGENC-based PCR.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive tests on the basis of faulty reagents, and an impediment to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout the month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then were local and state laboratories allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for RT-PCR-based COVID-19.
Quest Diagnostics also made testing for COVID-19 nationally available as of March 9, 2020.
No quantity restrictions have been announced; the collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be conducted within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (US) for Abbott laboratories for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorization for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S. FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
As it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and binds it in a particular way to the nucleocapside protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "thorax x-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT, computed tomography, findings may be present even before the onset of symptoms."
Typical CT features include bilateral multilobar opacities in frosted glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetrical distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging aspects coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for an initial checkup.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days ago or soon after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring. Assays can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by means of remote laboratory tests (PoCT).
High-productivity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection step is not required before testing. On March 26, 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency as required, and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA with an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
Antibodies are normally detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK considered that none of the acquired antibody test kits were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which suspicious patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they must expel saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result shortly afterwards. The British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspect cases at home.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea perform some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, with 10,700 having been tested the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several large cities.
Since March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested until the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the hospitals Technion and Rambam developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 additional patients simultaneously, combining the samples and performing the test.
With construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, modeling revealed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to handle the quarantine would have doubled if that testing capability did not have online access.
The Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by the Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily yield was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed models released by Origami Assays were launched as capable of testing up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19, using only 93 trials. These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic manipulators for liquids.
In March, shortages or insufficient quantities of reagent became an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, the UK and the US.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols involving heating the samples to 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was reported that the UAE is now doing more per capita testing in its population for Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on their way to increasing the level of testing and reaching the higher population share.
This was due to a combination of drive-through capability, and the acquisition of a Group 42 population-scale mass processing laboratory and BGI (inspired by its "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world’s first such scale to operate outside China.
Different testing methods aimed at different components of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany’s method for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that lack the resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Center for Disease Control was not available until January 28, there was delay in the tests made available to the U.S. and to China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of the test kits right at the beginning of the outbreak, in addition, these countries along with Australia were not able to provide sufficient health kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing.
In contrast, experts say South Korea’s wide availability for testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, largely in private-sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs as the best way to slow the advancement of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private US laboratories, and the supply of swabs and chemical reagents has been affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems accurately in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented “failures”; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be a consequence of a failure in the collection of samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Minister of Spain stated that he would cancel kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China generated incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said that Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that he would not "use them". The United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not useful.
The testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and monitoring of those with whom people positive for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two stages of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all discovered cases were quarantined.
With commuting restricted, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions for the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began seriously advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened within schedule after the holiday on March 23.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that performed more tests, relative to the number of deaths, had lower mortality rates, probably because those countries are better able to detect those with no or little symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of WHO’s 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" is influenced by the testing policy of the countries.
A country that tests only people admitted to hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they present symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands for the purpose of removing dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the oro-fecal route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as the flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing your hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning your child’s buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, meat or fish.
If soap and water are not available, the hands can be sanitized with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand sanitization:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, feed or animal waste.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main purpose of handwashing is to clean your hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and decreasing the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study found that hand washing best practices can lead to small improvements in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhoea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to poor areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes may be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs), such as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the leading ARI, is the leading cause of mortality among children under five, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually associated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin injuries due to skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive handwashing can cause a condition of peeling and skin irritation known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Frequent hand washing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (micturition, defecation), after cleaning a child’s buttocks (exchanging diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other situations when the correct technique for hand washing should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cut or injury; after sneezing, coughing or blowing the nose; after touching animal waste or dealing with animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of handwashing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families had the habit of handwashing with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States near the average at 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate at 23 percent. Several methods for changing the behavior of children in schools currently exist to increase acceptance of the habit.
The “Essential Health Services Program” implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large-scale action to promote children’s health and education.
Deworming twice a year, supplemented with daily handwashing with soap, daily toothbrushing with fluoride, are at the center of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleansing agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, organic dirt components, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleanliness is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies analyzing the bacterial transmission of a contaminated bar soap have concluded that transmission is unlikely since the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic controls for dosage is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely disseminated to the health-conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants may lead to the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even though antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are reported.
In addition to the surfactants and skin-protecting agents, the complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other moisturizers for the skin (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of antibiotics as well as antibiotics from the University of Oregon School of Public Health has indicated that the final
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37oC).
However, soapy hot water is more effective than soapy cold water at removing the natural oilyness that retains dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand sanitizing agent of non-aqueous base.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-aqueous alcohol-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, antiseptic hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a humectant, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 logarithm reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of hand bacteria 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 logarithm reduction) of hand bacteria 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost totally ineffective against the norovirus-type virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for hands or alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their extremities are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands with hand sanitizers, especially when your hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid extermination action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers may cause skin dryness unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based hand sanitizers rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause irritative contact dermatitis has become attractive compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous based agents do not cleanse hands of organic matter, only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water for preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and has historically fallen far short of alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford a soap and instead use ash or dirt.
Gray or earth may be more effective than pure water, but they may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the earth or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends grey and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Rinse hands with running cold or hot water.
Running water is recommended since fixed sinks may be contaminated, while water temperature does not appear to be relevant.
Rub your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when soap is used instead of pure water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for a longer time removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Washing in a sink can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped enamels can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep your hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions capable of increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or cast iron with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions for storing water, such as "low cost faucets" and other options.
An improvised tap is a simple technology that uses a jug suspended by a rope, and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water into your hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand sanitization process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
A growing volume of research suggests that towel papers are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the towel paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by towel paper, heated air hand dryers and the most modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air dryers caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the area of the palm near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. The researchers also conducted tests to define whether there was potential for cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air-jet dryer, which projects air out of the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to expel microorganisms from the hands and the unit potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of hot air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Towel papers did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Washing hands with moistened hand wipes is an alternative to the lack of soap and water during travel.
Hand sanitizers based on alcohol must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical handwashing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with its use.
Clinical hand washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to soap and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the interlocking of the fingers.
If there is residue under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
Because germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse thoroughly and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, towel paper should be used to close the tap (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of handwashing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related infections in the bloodstream by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and rubbing in sectors of the health system.
The draft guidance for hand hygiene of the organization can also be found on this website for comments.
An applicable review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines “Five Moments” for hand washing:
after exposure to body/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soaps) confers an exterminating action on a handwashing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" the hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, some antiseptics under chlorhexidine or iodine cleaning.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms to the elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms should not run into the hands.
After hand washing is finished, the hands are wiped with a sterile towel and the surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after serving a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and a little significant additional benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Washing with common soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand sanitization with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds for each bacterial revealed that the hand sanitizer more than 2 percent antibacterial soap reduced the alcohol-based
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands. Interventions to increase hand sanitization in hospital environments may involve raising staff awareness about hand washing.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different health facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable sources of water, soap or handwashing resources in people’s homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge to achieve the universal practice of handwashing.
For example, in most rural Africa handwashing faucets near any public or private toilets are rare, although there are inexpensive options for building handwashing stations.
However, low handwashing rates may instead be the result of entrenched habits and not the absence of soap and water.
Encouraging and advocating handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and provoke a long-term change in the population’s behavior.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF’s “Three Star Approach” which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the maximum three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be a part of the handwashing promotional campaigns carried out with the aim of reducing diseases and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign trying to achieve a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has released the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the classification in DALY.
However, one analysis suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health—especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals—was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English “founder of modern nursing.”
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health care-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with “proper hand washing techniques” were hung next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression “washing your hands” means declaring reluctance to take responsibility or be conniving with something.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a more general phrase in use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to cleanse an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and often give more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of “cleaning,” such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe handwashing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, using water, but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual handwashing characteristic in many religions, including the Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, the tevilah and the netilat yadayim.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam allow for handwashing after use of the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam allow for handwashing before and after meals.
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19
Occupational hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational health and safety methodologies for hazard controls for the prevention of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace hazard controls depend on the workplace and the work itself, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
According to the Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), the functions with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory label, and a routine cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Functions with an average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or direct contact with people who are not known to be contaminated or suspected of being contaminated by COVID-19, but may be infected due to current community transmission or having traveled abroad.
This includes workers who keep in touch with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments, and in the high-volume retail market.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with used high-efficiency air filters, protective covers, and provision of personal protective equipment if a person is confirmed to have COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health system and morgue workers who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures on people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 generation of aerosols and collect or handle specimens from these people.
Suitable hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have several effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they are sick, because they have to take care of others, or because they are afraid of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of which products are in demand and the means of purchasing those products (such as making purchases outside peak hours or by delivery or drive-through services.
Finally, the shipment of items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors of individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the necessary controls to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action and preparedness plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people who are at higher risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a structure widely used in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and may be the most cost-effective implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected on the basis of hazard to the worker, properly adjusted as needed (respirators, for example), used properly and continuously, regularly inspected, preserved and replaced as needed, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), jobs with low risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, and using the respiratory label, including stopping sneezing and coughing, preparing containers for handkerchiefs and for common garbage, preparing workers for teleworking or for other staggered work shifts, and disabling, if necessary, the use of equipment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who exhibit symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce fever or relief from other symptoms, and also recommends that they have family policies that take care of the sick leave policies to allow them to be flexible.
According to OSHA, works with average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people about whom it is not known if they are confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the current community transmission in the company’s location, or because the individual has a recent history of traveling abroad, in a country with high COVID-19 transmission.
These include the workers who have contact with the general public, the workers who have contact with the general public, the workers who have contact with the general public, the workers who have contact with the general public, the workers who have contact with the general public, the workers who have contact with the general public, the workers who have contact with the general public, the workers who have contact with the general public, the workers who have contact with the general public, the workers who have contact with the general public.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolating the sick person from others for a distance of 6 feet, with the designation of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer him a face mask, or to ask the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.
The crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick patient has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a biohazard waste bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include postponement of the trip by the sick passenger, self-isolation, and immediate communication to the onboard medical center if anyone experiences fever or other symptoms during the trip.
For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has been present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large groupings such as physical education classes or choirs, or meals in a snack bar, increasing the space between tables, tighter arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using a separate health care location for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, prolonged school dismissals can be considered. For law enforcement officials who perform daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who contact individuals with suspected COVID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medicine technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and morgue workers to be at high or very high risk of exposure.
Functions with high risk of exposure include drug delivery workers, healthcare workers, laboratories and medical transport workers, who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens from these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive specimen collection.
Works in high-exposure morgues include workers involved with preparing the bodies of people with confirmed COVID-19 or with suspicion of the disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed COVID-19 or with suspicion of the disease, including when aerosol-generating procedures were performed.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some morgue scenarios and in the health area.
Specimens should be handled with biosafety level 3 caution.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering the hospital be separated into two distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals working at a distance of 6 feet from patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 particulate filtered facial respirators approved by NIOSH or higher quality respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend wearing overalls, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
The WHO recommends only a surgical mask for screening staff at the entry point.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles or face protection, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients to enter a room with a patient with COVID-19, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it while treating multiple patients with the same diagnosis.

We find ourselves in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Their challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and community building, which are the foundations of this organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a remarkable validation of the amazing human beings with whom we are privileged to work.
I am very grateful and proud to have you all as co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
This person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol it is for this essential feature to remain online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible as you keep the workplaces active, pay our co-workers, and keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but the way we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the coming days and months.
At this meeting, we considered what we think is an action appropriate to what we are experiencing and the best way to maintain the sustainable organization in this period.
We want to end stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to leave for a while, no problem.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily work expectation will be 4 hours, or 20 hours per week, until otherwise arranged.
We're not declaring a holiday, so if you can work during normal hours, it could be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and whether you need to take care of loved ones, buy groceries or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedule.
If you are sick, do not work.
This rule would not even need to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
No certificate or paid leave is required. Just let your manager help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure key work areas are served.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification industry so that his industry can help you and ensure that your situation receives the appropriate attention from management.)
The staff who work per hour will receive the full payment.
We have said this before, and we are committed to honoring our commitment to our contractors and hourly employees.
Everyone will receive their salaries based on their normal work schedule under normal circumstances.
Wages are independent of whether you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give full support to you.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remember that your well-being is more important.
We only ask that you communicate it to your manager, so that we know what to expect and can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to perform.
Site Reliability Engineering, HR, Reliability and Security and Fundraising (among others) teams perform essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current goals and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is a lot to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now will not hurt us in the future.
We have no intention of “working together to make up for lost time” after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
In order to adjust to our new reality and expectations of working hours per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide longer time for the budget, and that employees prioritize essential work, personal care and care of loved ones, while accommodating those who need or want to work on a shorter journey in the coming weeks.
Timeline extension greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the Annual Planning team for their leadership in this process.
Status, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco co-workers may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, as a precaution, we employed an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and all elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is employing its own protocol of care duties using products that are safe for its attendees.
We are relieved by the fact that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located at a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all Washington employees.
Last week, our Washington office switched to a fully remote setting, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing the leasing of an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider dividing them into several days.
Set the meeting, have a schedule and send materials for reading in advance.
Use videos as standard, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make it easier to collaborate and connect in real time.
Have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone to monitor questions in the chat and the attendee list, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency aids to buy snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to assist in increasing remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editing marathons, until the WHO declares an end to the pandemic.
We advise you that we understand that our cancellation request and other restrictions could make it impossible for you to complete your agreed-upon grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying your goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be of sadness with the shutdown, but also of relief with the clarity and ability to keep focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and other situations.
The communication resources team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Staying up-to-date on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with employees.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're on this together and we'll help with whatever it takes.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email and all other COVID-19-related information on the company wiki.
The Communications Resources team will update these pages and all information in a single location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the coverage challenge, or anything else you might need help with, be sure to notify it and work with the communication resources team.
We are here to help you provide support and collaboration as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that at this time our work and obligations will probably need to adapt in a way that we have not adapted in the past.
These are the steps we believe are needed as support at this time, so that we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support it needs and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months ahead.
We need all of you to make it happen, so we need everyone to take care of you and your family so that you are in your best condition when you need it.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!

The type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the angiotensin-related converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising the Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug aimed at the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ECA2 also functions as a point of entry into the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and a C-terminal amino acid and colectrin transporter domain in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-pass type 1 membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the domain of the transmembrane by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of the major pulmonary alveolar cells type II, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
Expression of ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE cleaves the type I angiotensin hormone into type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn cleaves carboxyterminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Gist).
ECA2 also cleaves several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinophine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike protein S1 to the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosomes located inside cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to hypothesize that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help in fighting infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing with the ACE inhibitor pattern and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia relative to controls."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Human recombinant ECA2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with an acute lipopolysaccharide-induced respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of the effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications to help monitor in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for creating contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on tracking the geographic location of application users.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with a person with COVID-19.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be ceded to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and offer a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government declared that the contact tracking application was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand foresee applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if application acceptance is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple sets limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them only to “official” or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data should be protected and presented as evidence-based;
digital surveillance should prevent further discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for by law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created to use central servers for intercommunication only (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a proprietary app, the system gathered tracking information from multiple sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate text message alerts for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also made location information publicly available, which is allowed due to comprehensive changes to information confidentiality laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralized one.
By April 6, 2020, details had not yet been released.
Contact tracking preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific literature dating back to at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on solutions that respect privacy, with the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that encompasses centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Other Mobile Protocols.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during the collection and use of location data or cross paths to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication “Applications Play Dirty: Keeping Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” released in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, an enterprise that develops privacy technologies and originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and those responsible, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that came together around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government application, has become open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system envisages implementation in three stages:
development of tools to allow the government to create official coronavirus tracking applications preserving privacy
Google and Apple plan to address persistent and assumed surveillance issues by first distributing the system through up-and-coming system updates, and later removing it in the same way as soon as the threat ends.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug repositioning, reprofiling, reassignment or therapeutic replacement) is the repositioning of an approved drug for the treatment of a medical condition or disease different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research targets include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and COVID-19 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 druggable proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these binding points provides the reasonable design for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that they then refined and analyzed for their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a malaria drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trials process and is authorized through the AUE only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors said they are using the drug when “there is no other option.”
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU’s Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was “clearly effective”.
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence to support the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to stock it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for the Trump administration over the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication through protease binding.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about directing resources to repropose drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir exhibited antiviral activity in vitro against phyllo, pneumo, paramixo, and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which can lead to more serious transmissions or diseases.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate illness and one for those with more severe illness.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for people hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19: two of them are placebo-controlled (in China and Canada), while the other has no control group (Italy).
New York State began testing azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) of Japan plans a clinical trial of Alvesco (cyclesonide), from the company Teijin, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is the treatment of presymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is underway with 200 patients, to be recruited among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria, to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
At the moment, researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are investigating the role of colchicine in reducing lung complications and inflammation in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding or who do not use effective contraception were not included in the tests.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used in the treatment of patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients is analyzing the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages. The study was announced on April 14, in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable to give new purpose to antiviral drugs approved and developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as capable of receiving a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine.
Although there is no vaccine with clinical trials completed, there are several attempts underway to develop it.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against the disease-causing virus SARS-CoV-2 to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a large spread of the outbreak in 2020, which led to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) said in April that the needs for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 diverse technology platforms being researched and developed during early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The goals of the major platforms that have advanced to the Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). Another 37 were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being designed).
A phase I-II test performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active-developing vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet had evaluation in humans (they are still in preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular staple, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, announced the start of work on a vaccine, with the goal of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine with technology similar to that used for vaccination therapy against neoantigens.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary company of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that they were starting a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested on humans “in the next 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it has joined Novavax Inc.
development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the preclinical trial and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated pace, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a Coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is under research in the lab, with human tests planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian stated that U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac “large sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine” under protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, an mRNA-based candidate vaccine, currently under preclinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could set off for human testing in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a research consortium for the COVID-19 vaccine involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh 29 dollars, leading CEPI-19’s total investment in developing the vaccine for COVID million.
CEPI’s other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun testing on animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequencing from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national “vaccine bank” of several new vaccines that could be used if other Coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines that elicited potent antibody-specific responses to antigens [in the mouse] that were evident to have begun 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A subsequent randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 health workers.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of the vaccine using specific animal specimens for COVID-19, such as the transgenic ACE2-rat, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosafety containment measures to handle live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccinations against SARS and MERS have already been tested on non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. Nor is there a proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became prevalent, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful model for vaccine development and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that completed phase I of human clinical trials, and three others in progress, all of which are virus vectored vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectored by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time of exposure to the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some evolve into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have healed. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced upon exhalation, they typically fall to the ground or remain on surfaces rather than remain infectious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although dissemination may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people with suspicion of the virus and for people responsible for its care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use, and others compel use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries by all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, coughing, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty staying awake, bluish face or lips.
Less common, upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The role these asymptomatics play in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who show no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in their daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking loudly releases more droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause the droplets to reach 15 feet (4.5 meters).
Although the virus is not generally transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by bioaerosol may be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside people’s rooms contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted by air.
Although there is concern that it may be transmitted through the stool, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, usually a person infects one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day on cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in 99% copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Products with soap degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, disabling it, as well as eliminating it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, while the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with household soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells via the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), which is more abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a spicule (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of infected people who were admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in the severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high thanks to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 infections and may be related to the poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for respiratory tract epithelial cells expressing ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it has been shown that pathogenic T cells that secrete GM-CSF have correlation with the recruitment of IL-6-secreting inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates have also been reported in necropsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained through a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or phlegm sample may be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours up to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, tests using antibodies (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) were in development but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experiment with the test showed that its accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The United States FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use later that month. Diagnosis guidelines released by Wuhan University’s Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar frosted glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common at the onset of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (thickened lobular septa with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leucoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, as well as covering your mouth with the inner side of your elbow if the handkerchief is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public meetings.
The distancing guidelines also include people being at least 1.8 meters (6 feet) away from each other.
An effective drug for the prevention of COVID-19 is not known. Since the vaccine should not be released before 2021, a key point for COVID-19 control is to try to lower the peak of the epidemic, also known as "curve flattening".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using alcohol-based hand antiseptics with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where commercial hand antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity occurs through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not “an active substance for hand asepsis.”
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
People are treated through palliative care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under analysis.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments can be helpful for those with mild symptoms and in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
U.S. intensive care physicians and pneumologists gathered treatment recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health care professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risks of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health care professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with airborne infection isolation (AIIS) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions. The CDC summarizes guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blanket, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use respirators instead of face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (US).
They have been designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undescribed uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure at two levels.
Whether either of these leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits aerosol particles from spreading, compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in the elderly (those over 60 and especially over 80).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of the health system to cope with the sudden escalation in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China noted that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans that have pressure control mode and high PEEP level are needed to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung and pneumothorax injuries associated with ventilation.
High level of PEEP may not be available on older fans.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials are underway with several antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
While new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, several of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are in an advanced test phase.
Antiviral medication can be tested on people with various diseases.
The WHO recommended that volunteers participate in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has given temporary authorization to use plasma from convalescent people as treatment in cases where the person’s life is seriously and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies necessary to show its safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been performed.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to provide their name and ID number.
The application can detect “near contact” using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities. Big data analyses of cellular data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people they have had contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of people alleged to be with coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect people who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect who breaches quarantine.
The Italian regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he had been informed by mobile operators that “40% of people continue to circulate anyway.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may go through quarantine difficulties, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor, who said: “Increased social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease can have a mild course, with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory tract diseases, such as the cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 data is missing. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median manifestation of initial symptoms until death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), men had a 2.8% mortality rate, while women had a 1.7% mortality rate.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The imaging of the lung looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of comorbidity mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Underreporting of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die, compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authority found a 20 to 30 percent drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who have recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are thought to be the worsening of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, through overflow infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of symptom onset was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of symptom onset as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths resulting from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global lethality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240.191) on April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the rate of lethality per case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the rate of lethality per infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time-restricted and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths should have been formally registered as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had confirmed death from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is highest in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in the 50s, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immune differences due to sex, lower prevalence of smoking women and the development by men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, mainly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020, that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
The head of WHO, Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus, explained that "CO" is from "crown", "VI", from "virus", "D", from disease and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatizations. The virus that causes COVID-19 has been called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “the COVID-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19” in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended "2019-nCoV" and "acute respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV" as interim names for the virus and the disease, according to the 2015 guidance against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health supplies, such as nasopharyngeal sores and respirator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on time, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease arose, which quickly spread across the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is underway in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARY Trial” to evaluate the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with most likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the whole virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to elicit a rapid immune response from the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spicule protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been pointed out as a possible challenge to the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There have been more than 300 clinical trials underway since April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The retargeting of antiviral drugs makes up most of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries due to a report in late April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There has been an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for peer review of the survey.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that doubling that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA published an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be further studied in vivo after demonstrating low SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory concentration. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein in preparation for serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-storm properties of cytokine. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the conclusion of a small study.
A non-randomized Phase 2 national-level trial is underway in Italy after demonstrating positive results in people with the serious disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered to be the cause of death for some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled, randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccination method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies specific for this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of strongly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
