Spectacular wingsuit jump over Bogota
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over Colombia's capital, Bogota, on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a suit with wings), it passed at 160 km/h over the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many scouts had gathered to observe its feat.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners are struggling to find the money needed to repair decaying highway infrastructure, many are seeing a solution in the form of a small black box that sits above your car’s dashboard.
The devices, which record all the miles driven by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices to overhaul the outdated system of financing major American roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of major axes planning has suddenly provoked a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you travel, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is terrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern regarding the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress can’t agree on whether to continue, several states haven’t waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental ride.
This is truly essential for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, general manager of the Southern California Association of Governments, which predicts the state will begin recording the miles traveled by every Californian driver by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gas tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently had trackers installed on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
“This turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long run,” he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage charge.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the Transportation Committee of the House of Representatives, said he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
Proponents of the Reason Foundation’s free market also appreciate the idea of charging drivers per mile.
“It’s not just a tax going into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The move is also supported by two former U.S. transportation secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go down the road of payment per mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, addressing the concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to their work or city.
Several states and major cities, however, are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the most important experience in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state mileage fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is attempting a trial on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer drivers recently equipped their cars with an aircraft, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their slightest deeds and gestures.
“The concerns about Big Brother and things like that are a big deal,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
At the start of the test, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location devices."
It is not necessary to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily comings and goings.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small start-up in California called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to states.
It was looking to break into the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she tests have appealed to the planners of the major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive ways and far less intrusive methods of doing so.
In Oregon, planners try the experiment by offering drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all state residents.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxation device that would also be equipped to pay for parking fees, provide “pay-to-drive” insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them,” said an urban planning document.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole mileage debate isn't just a huge diversion.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
A single or additional annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unreleased Albums
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
Starting from The Next Day, which was released in January, he has concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unreleased.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone pantyhose.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, from 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that he could still be counted on to sparkle the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one ride in his bag with The Next Day.
Thin White Duke is releasing the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will come in the form of three discs: the original album, previously unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously unveiled clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks from the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe Edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, it gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars far ahead and a rock electricity cleverly mastered.
Unreleased already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a luminous ride that gradually slows down to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John’s Rocket Man, or even to Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again makes reference to his strangeness: Would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, enchanting, make you want to leave the Earth.
In any case, Bowie is having fun playing the chameleon with these titles: informant in turn, man on board a rocket, martian potential...
He hides and reveals at the same time, playing to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the Louis Vuitton Invitation to Travel campaign, which he embodies in his new face.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the military followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released before they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel — who do not meet the army’s “universal service” rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks — to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, has been released from the military despite his request to stay an extra year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case followed that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not meet the universality rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are not fit for combat.
Under current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal veterans spokesman Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Disney to launch an animated series on tablets
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to prefer tablets to its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie’s Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is only scheduled for 2014, according to the statement from its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of Callie Cat, sheriff of a city in the American West where she makes order reign with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under the age of 2 have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under the age of 8, compared with 10% and 38% two years ago, respectively.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on US surveillance
US intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday with Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter he presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts has been obviously positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he believed that support from the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the US Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will make this possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been put to the test following complaints that the NSA has wiretapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said if there was a chance to hear Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States," it should be taken advantage of.
German Green MP Ströbele posted a photo of him with Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Ströbele said that according to the former NSA consultant’s lawyer, Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “serious and sustained” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global response to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have judged the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public benefit.
The letter makes an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.”
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their TV in the not-so-distant future.
The Cogeco subsidiary said on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,” Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus following in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, although the Cogeco subsidiary has no precise date for this new platform.
"We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail," Audet said.
The ultimate goal is to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in talks with some major cable providers to make its service available through their streaming platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Throne Speech on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the option of paying for pay-per-view services.
“It’s been about two and a half years since we’ve said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy major channel packages doesn’t work,” Audet said.
He hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"A new kind of framework will need to emerge from these discussions to define our new Canadian cultural policy with respect to television," said Cogeco's CEO.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry this spring.
On the results side, Cogeco indicated to have recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82<0xC2><0xA2> per share.
This is a decrease compared to net earnings of $44.9 million, or 83<0xC2><0xA2> per share, from the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the U.S.-based cable company Atlantic Broadband for $1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based Internet provider, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90<0xC2><0xA2> per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93<0xC2><0xA2> per share, in the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable’s revenues, however, increased by 45% to $470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is up 5546.
Mr. Audet was not concerned that the number of clients would fluctuate in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat has been found in canned beef products sold by two small British retailers at low prices, the food hygiene agency said today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the chains Home Bargains and Quality Save, contained horse DNA in the amount of 1 to 5%.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes erupted in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles left four injured, early Friday, on Route 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car arriving in the other direction.
All four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal at around 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 to passengers carrying carry-on baggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though in its announcement Wednesday it said passengers could take the unopened can with them when they get off the plane.
The new carry-on baggage fee applies to bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 was intended to encourage travelers to pay the fee in advance.
“We don’t want to charge that price,” she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as much as they could in the carry-on baggage in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in those compartments.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O’Malley said that these new fees will not really be used to collect money.
It’s about making Frontier’s most loyal customers understand that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and check-in procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these charges before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s carry-on baggage fee will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often groan about baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are high and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them have not been affected by baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant airline followed a little later.
The only other airline that imposes such charges is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit’s carry-on baggage costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate as passengers discovered the airline’s unusual carry-on baggage charges.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my professional career,” he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and a fight break out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "the passengers boarded at lightning speed."
Frontier also does like Spirit and charges a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said passengers who take a soda or juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be booked for free.
She will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for drinks in 2008 but went back seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Frontier’s decision to charge a carry-on baggage charge when passengers do not purchase their tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to shop directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it started offering only half of loyalty miles to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced mileage bonuses by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seats in advance only if they purchase their tickets directly on Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown of Denver, but her business declines and she loses money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and its flight capacity declined nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempted to straighten Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA blames an “internal error” and not hackers for the breakdown of its website
The shadowy National Security Agency said Friday it was a bug that caused its public site to crash for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the outage was due to a distributed denial-of-service (DSD) attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still can’t access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the NSA’s website breakdown by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The formerly ultra-secret NSA, once dubbed the “No Such Agency,” has come under the spotlight and been heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications surveillance programs at home and abroad – which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the agency and leaked by the former Snow bus.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked much speculation that tonight’s incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville is now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, and individual employees were met to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” said Félix Bisson, Regional Director of Labor Relations at Delta Hotels.
The closure of the Delta takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will see the light of day within two years.
Titan CEO: “Goodyear Amiens acquisition project starts with zero employee”
After tossing the sponge with a bang in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear site in Amiens-Nord promised at the closure, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tire manufacturer Titan, says today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the factory has.
Arnaud Montebourg, minister of productive recovery, had already announced it, Monday, October 21.
After giving up the project to buy the plant in January, you come back today.
You spoke of violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turn-of-the-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man trying to save some of the highest-paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of taxation and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours handicaps France.
In India, China, and many other countries, people work 10 to 12 hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with the right price and skilled workers, it’s worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the factory closure, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance pay, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
Titan could then move the machines to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
But he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from Goodyear’s current 1,200 employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit down at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to secure those 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance pay.
If all employees accept them, the project to buy the plant starts with zero employees.
How can we give guarantees of duration of employment when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier profit drops as aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc., a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and aircraft deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its Trains division.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also failed to provide flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious timetable for commercial commissioning before next September.
After the test aircraft's maiden flight about a month and a half ago, it only flew three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was on track.
Results did not live up to expectations and stock prices fell 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating from "overperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for the stock market to rise over the next quarter or two.
“While the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for the CSeries aircraft has so far been modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
At present, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders before the commercial commissioning of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was advancing according to schedule.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than planned,” Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the plane’s downtime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and have an update period, and that's what we did.
This will occur throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could fly a CSeries aircraft just 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the timetable for entry into service and will provide further information in the coming months.
“This slow flight test – while apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue declined slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.

The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, up from 83 previously.
The delay in the Aerospace division was $32.9 billion at September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
“In aerospace, the results were in line with our forecast, but the low order count and general market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Aeronautics revenues fell 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, said revenue from the division had increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The Transport division's order book totaled $32.6 billion as of September 30, a slight increase from December 31 the previous year.

Two speleologists, ages 23 and 27, have been missing in a ditch under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, the Isère Relief Department said on Friday.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one experienced in practice and the other not, had left underground Thursday at about 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We haven’t heard from them since then, the source said.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5am," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the rescue speleo in charge of organizing the rescue.
Dozens of people on the spot
About twenty rescue workers, ten civilian members of the French Relief Corps, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on the scene.
In the late afternoon of Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of cavers who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers of the 13th Battalion of the Chasseurs alpins de Chambéry, were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They got lost in the network, turned on their feet while waiting for relief, the prefecture said.
Recharged, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the first responders in the evening.
German journalists urged to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday urged its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services the day after new revelations about the activities of U.S. and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and messaging until further notice,” it said in a statement.
She called the Washington Post’s report “scandalous” that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected massive amounts of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"The searches carried out by journalists are as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," said Michael Konken, president of the union that claims 38,000 members.
Fireworks repainted: MP asks for Brigitte Grouwels’ resignation
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' project of "relifting" the posts of the traffic lights in Brussels does not appeal to everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the center of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 posts of traffic lights of the region in the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The aim is both to "increase security" and "the Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all the Brussels traffic lights, at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to the Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamingization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content with spending the money of the Brusselsers insanely in operations of relifting the signal posts in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues its operations of flamingization of the Capital," De Bock said in a statement.
After her taxis yellow-mango-black, she finally repainted herself in yellow-dark blue-black the poles of Brussels.
According to the deputy, there is now "no more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The people of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who carries out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse from Flanders.
"As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected with only 2,245 votes or 0.5% of the Brussels population!" concluded Mr. De Bock.
the Portico de Pont - de - Buis
The ecotax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived at the scene shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national road was diverted in the process.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico.
It is the last of the three ecotax gantries in operation in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to the thousands of developers who own a prototype of the connected glasses signed by Google.
They can thus acquire a headphone, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $ 50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of micro-fibers or an in-ear earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with correction lenses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn’t know how I was going to continue to “frequently” it.
There is no recipe, no instruction manual to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that never leaves me, laid on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily actions.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle with cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found his body empty, crippled on that hospital bed with creased sheets.
Likewise, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the meagre glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, by small apparitions day or night, a little timid, a little erased, it quickly returned to my mind, evolving as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thought that was in mourning.
And then, she revealed herself to me while revealing my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had by no means lost the person of my mother but simply a woman I didn’t really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and released the person I loved, and now I was finding her, full and whole.
This detour of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my dad, "inside and out," he says.
I've always been told.
I never believed that at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was scared, when I was in pain...
He spoke to me, encouraged me constantly, inhabited my body.
I could see his hands as I looked at mine, lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I was able to have a personal life.
He gave me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are gone but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to them: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only there is always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and fit into my history and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound, when I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he was smiling at me and was glad that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to signify to me that he was sharing with joy what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I am delighted to share this common memory lived after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
I realized my grief pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and being interested in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master's degree in a large school, were not, in hindsight, trivial choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades – before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are always present, so that I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and uprightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes on me.
My mother passed away nineteen years ago now.
She died after talking to me on the phone.
I went through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers itself, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time eased the pain.
All that remained was the lack, that unanswered emptiness, that need of her, of entrusting herself to me, of reassuring me in the depths of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning I see his anxious eyes resting on me, I see the dark circles that weigh down his gaze, the fine lines around the lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile again, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the middle of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself in my dreams when the morale is a little low.
We feel carried and protected in difficult times, the backwardness of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay on the path she had paved for us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot take it away from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or liked.
I could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in accordance with his vision of things.
I have had problems in my work because of these beliefs.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: Is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he is there every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It was almost thirty years ago that my husband passed away at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6 years old.
The immense pain that then invaded me has, of course, diminished, but he is still close to me.
Very often it "disembarks" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even more sad to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he says "I'm coming down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in awe, anxious and lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I still live in the same house, and often, I feel observed and I turn around to see if he is not there, I know it is him and I speak to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world would I leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a job with responsibility, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad on Friday released official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We are not telling the world to stand by us and support each other, we have the right to ask the world for it because we are part of it," al-Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved, it will spread, and what is happening in Syria will spread as well.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution set up by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They held up placards accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
Cocaine Lawyer Who Informed a Drug Godfather of a Police Investigation Was Imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Assize Court.
A top defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after compromising on his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by criminals to be a "file of first importance", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police wiretapping operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial related to drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Law Society dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular user” of this Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought illegally to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Along with 32 other men, they were subsequently jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine for <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m, as well as more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared that her drug use would be revealed.
Ditta, who works at the Blackburn-based Forbes Solicitors law firm, fell out of favor today after being convicted on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, 60% pure, under the lawyer's garbage in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposition, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drugs, and they phoned each other nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine after tests showed traces of the Class A drug in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege".
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and attempted to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that clients sometimes called him home for legal reasons.
But the court heard testimonies that he called major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “If anyone needs to know that they shouldn’t break the law, they’re a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of getting too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But it went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He got too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any unlawful conduct and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: “Mr. Ditta went from being a criminal lawyer to being a criminal himself as soon as he started getting drugs from criminal organizations.”
His cocaine addiction compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the ins and outs of leading members of organized criminal groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest integrity rules and build trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit investigated Mr. Ditta, who was convicted of all three counts of cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in trafficking heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta held a question-and-answer session about himself during which he said his dream job would be to be a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will return to the stage in December
The Detroit Newspaper reports that the queen of soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board room of the MotorCity Casino hotel.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering from, the famous Respect interpreter told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She says she is “happy to be back.”
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas illuminations
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered with a mantle of light: one could approach the heat stroke in Menton with the invoice of illuminations.
Invoice that, unlike many municipalities, is also paid by taxpayers, and not by traders' associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport Evacuated After Shooting
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
He is said to be an employee of the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the gunman.
The incident reportedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travelers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Police quickly intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport car park.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is disrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five sketches imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, vignettes with a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Société d'art lyrique du Royaume will return with its lyrical destinations, a formula that now fills the pulpery of Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists from the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Apéro lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the Marie-<0xC3><0x88>ve Munger colorature soprano.
It was a benefit activity, along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air of The Bat.
Without giving precise figures, the chairman of the board of directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday, in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future looks good, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent supports.
"The finances are on the rise and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a step that we will take in seven years," the administrator commented.
"I would even say beyond that," added the CEO, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Surrey’s Gabrielle Roy School faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been charged with hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, carrying a dangerous weapon, kidnapping, and failure to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to immediately defuse the situation have been critical to the security conclusion of this incident," Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and is due to appear in court on Friday.
New application for class action against the Saint-Croix brothers
A new application for class action was filed against the brothers Sainte-Croix, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time at the Saint-Joseph oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The petition is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph oratory, where he was a mass servant and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed at only three institutions, and when we announced the settlement, many people said to us: "I was in such a place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The particularity of the class action that has just been filed is that it allows the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the brothers Sainte-Croix.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of the Holy Cross and the Oratory of Saint Joseph, which is nevertheless a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "exerted a moral, religious and psychological coercion on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated", and that they "convicted them".
The latter allegations are based, among other things, on letters written by the Sainte-Croix brothers' lawyer, Mr. Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research in the archives by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The class action must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Superior Court.
Once admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second stage, the hearings on the merits, is carried out.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of St. Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings on the merits were conducted.
Important fire in a trade
A fire severely damaged a business in Montreal’s LaSalle borough on the night of Thursday to Friday.
Rescue was called at around 1 a.m. on Friday due to a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Rejane Street.
The 30 firefighters who were sent to the scene took nearly an hour to master the blaze.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said Richard Bordeaux, chief of operations for the Montreal Fire Safety Service.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly 20 homes, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested because residents of one of the apartments may need to be housed temporarily, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical help dying at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes just days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their lives, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus were on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Réseau des soins palliatifs du Québec also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of hospice homes will refuse to help patients die, according to Suzanne Fitzback, vice president of the Hospice Alliance.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked, “I want to die, give me an injection.”
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is disorienting the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, Gatineau Liberal MP Stéphanie Vallée says the notion of end of life will need to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
“This is a frightening country and it’s legitimate to ask the question: What will stop Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?” the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media court "will always be biased as it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament," he said.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to “take control of the media,” while The Standard said Kenya’s democracy and freedom of opinion “have been dealt a hard blow” and criticized the bill as “draconian.”
The passage of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack carried out by armed Islamists at the Westgate mall last September.
Kenyan media aroused the anger of the authorities by broadcasting footage of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly stole the luxury mall.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to question them, although the summons was withdrawn following a shield-raising in the media.
Under the new bill, media may be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million shillings, with the additional risk of being “deleted” or no longer able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid the fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to cripple most FM stations.”
He also says the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “lively blogosphere.”
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
“Given to themselves, the politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering.”
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and restored their shiny monthly tax-exempt salaries of around 532,000 shillings – which are among the highest in the world.
A tough year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists to the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a stir for the management of the Hôpital de la Cité-de-la-Santé during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmacy department found itself severely short of staff.
It lacked nearly 30% of the necessary workforce, making this fiscal year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire independent labor, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time hired pharmacist.
The problem was not solved, Ms. Beaudet explained.
We have streamlined or diminished some of our activities within the establishment to meet the time that things get back together.
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young [pharmacy residents] so that they come and stay here.
There was a contest of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is expected to be much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are returning to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in the past few months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain have paid off, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain in the CSSS.
“Now it’s much better,” the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill our departures from last year.
Growing Needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or the prevalence of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always drive to three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
In the last year, we've had a lot more and we don't have any pharmacists available to do replacements, so it was harder.
The 22-year-old top model does not start her film career by the small door.
Director Lars von Trier has chosen her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg as a young girl in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a 40-year-old sex addict since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to her eldest is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and Franco-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste for risk: the one who did not hesitate to lay naked on glazed paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on the big screen.
An excerpt from Nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he resorted to professionals of the X for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing his actresses into their final cuts, always for the better.
Stacy Martin hasn't stopped talking about her.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Méga CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, as a result of tingling in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility had the room evacuated and warned the fire department about a suspicious odor.
Approximately 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on tear gas background?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still, the cinema management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was airy and everything came back in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to bring into the country two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins, Thursday morning, at the Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's baggage that the drug was detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three pumpkins that had been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said CBSA spokeswoman Jacqueline Roby.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have made 173 drug seizures, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, a total of 1,653 seizures of narcotics were made by border services officers in the Quebec region.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of SA-8 short-range surface-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances roughly identical to the one that took place on July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont surface-to-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their anger at Washington’s revelation of the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine nears bankruptcy
Standard & Poor's on Friday lowered Ukraine's credit rating, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt goes to "B-", sinking into the category of speculative investments.
It has a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least a one-in-three chance that it will be down again within a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government’s strategy will secure enough foreign currency to meet its high foreign financing needs,” the agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine’s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the repayment of loans taken abroad.
These reserves, to which the authorities resort massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency considers increasingly likely a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of failing to pay a $882 million bill.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government at a time of intense tensions with its Russian neighbor, furious at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, compared with less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been asking for months for help from the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 granted it a loan of 15.3 billion dollars and has so far released only 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by raising gas prices to the population.
After a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF found this week that "significant external financing needs" constituted "a vulnerability", while highlighting "signs of economic improvement".
However, according to economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect any short-term improvement."
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the expert told AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditionals on the release of the opponent Yulia Timochenko.
"Signing the deal would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," S&P said, which fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, warned that if a free trade area was created between the EU and Kiev, it should tighten its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. green light for Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objection from U.S. authorities to their merger, moving closer to the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
“Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe today announced the expiry of the previously announced merger review deadline of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,” the two groups said in a statement.
They said they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the HSR review period in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary to carry out the transaction.
“The merger is also conditional on obtaining further regulatory approvals and approval from the shareholders of both groups.”
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would pursue M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be on the verge of being beaten after being driven from the northeastern towns of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that it had controlled since the insurgency began 20 months ago.
“We will pursue the M23 and harness it wherever it hides because they are criminals,” FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not allow them to reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, told RFI that these military setbacks would not change its demands at the peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion arose in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the escape of the government garrison and the passivity of the MONUSCO blue helmets.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of numbers, to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was overhauled and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of advancement of government troops is now unprecedented.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” Congolese affairs expert Jason Stearns predicted on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historic - it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has managed to defeat a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which fiercely denies it, of supporting militarily the M23, originally formed by former Congolese military mutinies.
British Foreign Minister William Hague has urged Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation after shells fell on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the town to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
“We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be one day liberated by the army,” said a resident of this neighboring Ugandan town.
“We lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatized,” he added.
Tests carried out by the Institut Pasteur on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have turned out to be negative, the health ministry said.
The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date.
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being affected, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, reported a drop in its quarterly profit due to lower refining margins on Friday, as its oil and gas production increased while remaining behind the group's targets.
Its third-quarter net profit fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters expected an average earnings per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year, with a 25% growth in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion over two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities declined slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to $380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported lower net profit on Thursday, despite rising oil and gas production.
Transportation of schoolchild: the complaint found admissible
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) requires from the beginning of the school year a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Ms. Lefèvre.
According to her, the SSRC was invited to mediation and asked for additional time to think about it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to work together and find solutions," said Lefèvre.
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) declined to comment.
The organization has only indicated that mediation is part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Hotel-Dieu's emergency rooms
Faced with the scourge carried out for several months by a part of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the minister of health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "postpone the timetable of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that will not be able to intervene on November 4.
A request officially made "to not run any risk on the handling of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but which was also aimed at not hindering the campaign of the PS a few months from the municipal elections.
Despite the ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective by that date.
Even if, in the APHP, the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred.
As of November 4, firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual visits to the emergency room of the Hôtel-Dieu will have all been instructed to take 30 serious cases a day to the emergency room of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, emergency room inmates will leave room on Monday for five general practitioners.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4," said Lo<0xC3><0xAF>c Capron, the president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the APHP, who supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to receive patients in an emergency," he said, stressing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on site, he said.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are being done gradually," said Nicolas Peju, a spokesman for the ARS, who said on November 4 "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to her," said emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his position as head of the SMUR at the beginning of July for having led the slingshot against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "warning caller" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
“They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
“If other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem.”
They are regularly engrossed.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting at the Lariboisière emergency room.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" to several sites do not risk representing an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources will have been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APHP are defending the "new hospital model" already launched since October 7 and which is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to participate in the establishment of a "permanent outpatient care".
“Where are we going if we ask people to self-diagnose?”, asks Gérald Kierzek for whom “the concept of a not serious emergency” is “dangerous” and marks a “medical regression”.
This is going to be like maternity level 3.
People aren’t crazy, they’re going to go where there’s the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency physician and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP councillor of Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, has again reminded Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken in favor of a moratorium so that there is no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, it would mark its clear disagreement, said Bruno Julliard, its spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of deferral to the other hospitals.
Obama ends IMF and World Bank wiretapping
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
The decision is part of the White House's attempt to retake control of the NSA wiretapping case after revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first mention of the IMF and World Bank surveillance by the intelligence agency since the scandal began.
Asked about the issue, a US administration official responded: “The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance targeting the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington.”
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official said Barack Obama had ordered the practice to stop in recent weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as that ending the wiretapping of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of that information.
UN welcomes new poverty reduction targets
The United Nations will now begin work on a new set of Goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “beyond national interests”.
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to initiate and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (UDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concern in Mozambique grows as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique’s founding president, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a t-shirt with the words “we want safety” in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the capital’s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is huge for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other’s responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, Renamo’s spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government holds the Renamo accountable for triggering the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer being respected by the Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have failed to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who do not stop arguing,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open university and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections due to take place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasury of war from the government.
The share of votes collected by Renamo has been falling steadily since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mr Mazanga said Mr Guebuza – who is expected to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what the Renamo’s capability is, but it has carried out disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railroad for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is up to the president to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“Nobody cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that “brutal force does not make the weight in the face of subtle cunning,” while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "far too violent, far too outrageous, and in some cases, far too obscene to be taught in school," Crossley-Holland advocated a "meticulous selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” causes children to “completely pick up”, the messages being “sublimated” into pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said, “You may have good intentions, but you’d rather keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
One fighter from Hamas’ armed wing was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza have learned.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shot by an Israeli armoured vehicle.
NSA spying: U.S. 'goes too far', admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in terms of espionage, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged, in Washington’s first admission in the midst of a controversy with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a US government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in NSA interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this doesn't happen in the future," Kerry said at a conference in London that he was attending from Washington on Thursday via video link.
In his speech broadcast, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of the US diplomacy has long justified the practices of intelligence and information gathering by the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention against possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of September 11, 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since thwarted numerous plans of attacks, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have effectively prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these plans in advance," he said.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way," said the secretary of state, who had already had to speak on the international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said on Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he is conducting a review of these practices so that no one feels deceived".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program, dubbed "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows the two agencies to retrieve data from optical fibers used by internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in January alone – ranging from metadata on emails, to text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any link to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and its leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the U.S. press claimed that the U.S. president was not aware of such wiretaps, Barack Obama refused to speak on the matter, citing national security.
On the other hand, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even returned the bullet to the European intelligence services that would have seized those communications, before supplying them to the NSA.
This would involve “military operations” in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and it would absolutely not target Europe, said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also angered China.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without its master asset, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the Ligue 1 club announced in a statement.
PSG, leader of the league against Monaco in the difference of goals, has released the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply said he was “injured,” without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated deceased
The Père Lachaise crematorium holds, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the cremated deceased in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for mayor of Paris, is due to attend and will then explain her funeral proposals at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% against 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book The Death in Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, insists on the "violence" that constitutes cremation, for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "erasing of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," responds Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Approaching Death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To tame the cremation, it is for François Michaud-Nérard, director general of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as dignified as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation want the organization of a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For a decade, they have been trying to avoid the violence of families waiting, doing nothing, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the handing over of the ashes," observes Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now propose masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: welcoming the assembly, naming the deceased, linking him to the others, evoking him, giving meaning to his death, organizing the farewell.
This has been the case at the Père Lachaise crematorium since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Père Lachaise crematorium organizes, since 2010, on All Saints' Day, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, rehousing because of rats turns to controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
Faced with the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office, proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, says Jo<0xC3><0xAB>l Canapa, the director of the agency.
There have always been rats in cities.
The deratization company performs two passes per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the rats do not flourish in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, you are not going to kill a child.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," says the father of the family who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the penny and we are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same price as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ends down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The stock suffered from the fall in the dollar against the yen, which was detrimental to export values and the warning about its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei Index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix lost 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house caught in flames in Old Quebec
A fire that started Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than thirty firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a three-dwelling house spread over four floors behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms happened, because it took reinforcements to attack the building, because it is buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, a spokeswoman for the Quebec fire department.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the place where stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremony at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began telling jokes directly in front of the audience, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay’s innovation has continued over the years, until being taken up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of the headliners emerged in the Carolinas, and had great success, until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year’s event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes,” a comedy and music evening for veterans at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year’s festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, for example presenting shows on small TV channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of fantasy football cheerfully lascivious of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate appeared on Saturday Night Live and was part of the cast of the series Parks and Recreation, but she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, along with other young comedians with a singular voice (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the City Hall, in the center of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He was telling me that when he was here, sometimes he would go down a lane between two buildings and say to himself, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here."
Oil price continues to fall and approaches $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns over the size of stocks offset a report showing China's electricity-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. benchmark crude for delivery in December fell by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel late in the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8% for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector on Friday, which show business growth, suggest demand is rising.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to pick up after growth rebounded to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after a decline not seen for two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Calling into question the right to abortion in Texas
A federal appeals court in Texas has reinstated restrictions on the right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy that were blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a bill passed in July in that state and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The ruling by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who practice IVG will have to have a "privilege of admission" to local hospitals.
Admission privilege is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a nursing member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical facility in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
Advocates of abortion argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of a third of the state's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge ruled on the eve of the law's entry into force that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But Texas Attorney General Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, has asked the appeals court to overturn the first-instance judgment that blocked the law’s enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star achieved a strong return to audiences, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV set, or 5.6% of audience share.
But was the show on the date?
Approximately 10,000 candidates have auditioned for this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the perched André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of returning to their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored on this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows brew a wide selection of budding singers, for better and sometimes for worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, a few have found their way.
There are many who have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of a successful singer are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD search and control policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge’s decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department’s control and search program and dismissed it from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the city appealed.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to monitor and question citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in amending its policy and associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday regarding the request for suspension.
The appeals court said the judge should be dismissed because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to court criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by falsely targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their control and search program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and oversight, and ordered a pilot program to test body-bearing cameras in neighborhoods where the largest number of controls are taking place.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police check.
The city's appeal hearing is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of checks and searches has existed for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 checks involving mainly black and Hispanic men.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's search and control program say they will end unfair practices, provide more effective and trusted police forces, and change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without lowering crime, represent a waste of money, and fail to solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers have been sharply reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not ending the constitutional control and search practices, but reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Tenants must go to vote, because each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the housing that goes in taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to raise rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We can no longer afford $100,000 in fireworks, $4 to $5 million in land, just in case...
Go vote, this is the best way to express yourself and say that it is enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elysée kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the steps until becoming a chef nine years ago.
He has served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their vacation spots, and fed countless of the world’s greats in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60.
The man with the open face, stripped skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 at Ferté-Saint-Aubin holds a CAP of pastry.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I've gone from one castle to another!" ironizes Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manies of the six presidents for whom he officiated, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
“It is always the head of state or his wife or partner who chooses the menus,” he recalled.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Regardless of heads of state who displayed relative indifference to terrestrial food, "they are all greedy," denounces gently Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had eliminated the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific regime demand".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during state dinners at the Elysee: you have to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the Elysée, who had a drink on Tuesday evening with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in his heart.
He said compliments.
“His human side came out,” he says.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of the flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 rue Hébert, has been the subject of three alarms from the fire department.
The fire broke out in the front, but rose on all three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, a spokeswoman for the Québec City Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid response of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The burning house housed four homes, but no tenants were at the scene at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin, but the sappers have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Second Trailer Released
Martin Scorsese leaves out some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget about being reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will cut your hair in his role as a mad trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a “Long Island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a broad corruption case on Wall Street.”
In the 80s, Jordan Belfort sets up a scam that will make him a rich man, very rich.
The opportunity to follow its incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains the holidays, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the key words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that brought them together in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese has been delayed due to its too long assembly.
It seems that the film is finally 2:45.
In the hall on December 25, he will be able to participate in the Oscars race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to attempt to confirm a phony hose on an affair involving then-working Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "pretty special counsel."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, with hacking into Pawlby's voicemail and "permanently crashing in front of her door," but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
“The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man who stands in front of people’s homes hoping to surprise them, he is the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they say about it,” Edis said.
He said NotW used three means to investigate the subjects: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Is he aware of the phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say “Of course.”
Rumors of an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's editorial board when a source, feeling sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said she was told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, on which voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures of the private investigator's computer involving Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Edis added.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Miss Pawlby's slightest deeds and actions.
In a voicemail he left to her on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he was dating co-defender Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking the phone.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister in full outbreak of violence
The U.S. president was due to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures released on Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN reports an even higher toll with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
The violence is increasingly deadly despite heightened security measures and large-scale military operations launched months ago by the Shiite-dominated government of Nuri Al Maliki.
The total death toll in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence raises fears of a new ignition as neighboring Syria is plagued by a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot dead in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and the target of unfair arrests, has fostered this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, renewed violence killed four people in northern Iraq, in the aftermath of at least 26 deaths in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a “global war” against Al Qaeda.
Violence is at the heart of U.S. Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki's talks, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive and congressional representatives.
On Thursday, he pleaded for the international community to wage a “third world war” against Al Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, attributing him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence for his “sectarian and authoritarian politics”.
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uyghur group of Tiananmen attack
China's Homeland Security chief on Friday accused a group of Xinjiang Uyghur separatists of being behind the car bombing that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, slammed into the crowd that stood on China’s capital’s famous square, a symbol of the deadly crackdown in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the East Turkestan Islamic movement of instigating the attack.
Many Uyghurs, a Turkish-speaking minority in Xinjiang, call the province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there animated by independence demands.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV.
“The group that was standing behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan,” he added, his remarks being taken up by the China New Agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uyghur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident left 42 injured.
The Islamic movement in East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probes on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a large survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October at each national bishops' conference, with the instruction to get as many answers as possible.
The information will be used for a major gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to hold next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent U.S. Catholic newspaper.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to probe parishioners.
In the UK, bishops posted the poll on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: the army attacks the last stronghold of the rebels
The irreducible M23, a few hundred fighters, were entrenched at nearly 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," a resident of Jomba told AFP, who was contacted by telephone at about 12:30 a.m. and said a girl was shot in the morning.
“The intensity of the clashes has diminished somewhat,” he added, “it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed back the rebels somewhat.”
According to the witness, who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "racking operation".
Behind him there was a loud noise of small arms crackling.
From Bunagana, a political stronghold and the last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase", with the FARDC having "encircled the residual positions of the M23 to dislodge them".
Since the resumption of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army on Friday, MONUSCO has not participated directly in the fighting, but has provided decisive intelligence, observation and planning support to government troops.
By the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were climbing towards the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border crossing with Uganda, military personnel assisted by civilians were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to replace another machine that was bombing M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday called once again on the rebels to “demobilize voluntarily” under penalty of being disarmed “by force”, but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December with no result for the time being.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it remains only to the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born out of a mutiny in April 2012 by former rebels, mostly Tutsi, who joined the army in 2009 after a peace deal.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala deny.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its subsoil is full of coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the return movement to the DRC that had started in the morning was reversed at midday.
"This morning we crossed back to go to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," Imelda Nyirankusi told AFP, surrounded by her nine children, including an infant on her back.
We have the impression that the shots are getting closer to the population.
In the early evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, that stage beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the sung and danced productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the French musical affirms itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart’s opera rock, most attempts got in the way of ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables carried the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Le Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the game.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as hit tubes.
The first takes up, this Christmas, her excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the worldwide creation of "Un Américain à Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the hits of the season.
On the other stages, musical performances such as "1789", "Lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are in tune with success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comédies musicales" and speaker at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard conquered.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First there are the "musical shows" that evolve at the behest of the producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others take a fifteen-year leap back on the pretext that you can serve just about anything when you have Matt Pokora at the head of the bill.
Then we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of Le Châtelet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are making a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects like "Rent", "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" or "The Awakening of Spring" are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough artists capable as on Broadway of singing, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of musicals, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
There are many jobs among regional theaters, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The pool of talent is as large as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often the boulevard theatre for adults rather than young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of a craze of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are expertly maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
Mayonnaise is grown in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major theaters of France in the same form as in Paris.
Serious injured in crash with ghost driver in Brussels ring
A road accident left one seriously injured, Friday morning at around 5.30am, on the inner ring of Brussels at the height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a phantom driver, who is unscathed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the site of the accident, while the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause any traffic jams as the accident occurred at the height of the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this exit/entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured at an attraction at Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at an attraction at Disneyland Paris.
His life prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" attraction.
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares for new assault
Children are playing on a charred armored vehicle that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday for a new assault on the last bastions of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on her own.
All that remains is Runyonyi Hill.
“Chanzu is not very strategic,” North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to travel to Bunagana on Saturday.
A political fief and last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred M23 irreducibles have been entrenched at almost 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day said the situation had been "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the previous day and were buried.
A girl was wounded by a bullet, and three other people were injured, including one seriously evacuated by the FARDC, said the witness quoted by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have not reported any casualties.
NSA revelations heighten corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a beautiful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew at low altitude over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence, again insisted in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant turned whistleblower, began unveiling his inexhaustible treasure trove of information on the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked corporate paranoia over state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop that spilled the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made transparent the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses.
I believe it is conceivable that this data is used in their mutual interest.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German IT SMEs.
German companies believe the United States poses as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, nothing to date indicates that the United States has passed on industrial secrets of foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them.
“This is not the right way to go,” said Hasso Plattner, president of German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to farmers.
Anything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations have been a shock to some companies who previously thought China was the biggest surveillance risk.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data held in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-U.S. members gave up their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations about the U.S. data mining program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers are now asking us a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, managing director of chemicals company BASF.
Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally unwilling to disclose the preventive measures they have put in place, in case that leaves the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long hammered the message that it is imprudent to pick up a free USB stick at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the car manufacturer Audi, says that collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany’s BfV advises its executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad due to the risk of harming the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SME’s often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV warned in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) conducted in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty in the second degree of having carried out acts of piracy of economic information, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia Teenager Who Died Under Unusual Circumstances Think Their Son Was Murdered
Parents of a Georgia teen whose body was found in a wrestling mat rolled into his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on Jan. 11 stuck in a rug standing behind the gymnasium stands of his high school.
Lowndes County Sheriff’s investigators have concluded that Johnson died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old’s family disputes these findings.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's findings.
“They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump said.
They are convinced that these findings were delivered for the sole purpose of covering up the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a briefcase and returned it to them in a mortuary bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I consider that there is a sufficient basis” to open a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated Johnson had died of “positional suffocation.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds evidence to warrant a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to hand over all video surveillance footage that investigators had examined.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video footage would contain clues to the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children for schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends schools have a stock of epinephrine – the EpiPen-branded auto-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in case of life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “I feel like something is biting my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue,” or “I have tingling on my tongue.”
NSA case highlights total lack of intelligence debate
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand publicly offends by summoning the U.S. ambassador on October 21, and on the other forbids the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response on the part of the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of U.S. surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of Le Monde a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the wiretapping of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't that be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on U.S. diplomacy’s analysis of political and other issues around the world, we see this as an important illumination for U.S. power.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to be outraged by this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation?
The implementation over the last ten years of very powerful technological tools of interception by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have put in place almost daily procedures for cooperation and exchange of information, which are described on both sides as essential.
As an example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the means of the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the US services, and in return - it has already been said quickly - the Americans can give information to the French on other regions of the world.
So the substantive question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to provide themselves with tools of interception, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, especially within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of infringements of freedoms.
What is the U.S. really risking? a deterioration of its image?
We may denounce them, but I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk to Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies – and this has been the case recently – learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest level of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US providers subject to US laws, and therefore to the grip of the NSA.
The vast movement of disclosures by media outlets around the world, which is helping to spark a debate on intelligence surveillance practices that have so far been virtually non-existent, could push lawmakers, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose ‘indeterminate sex’
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly assigned to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to state their child’s gender, allowing them to enter an “indeterminate” or “unspecified” gender on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infant, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and smashed.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersexuality being part of the group of the sixty diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term referring to people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and specialist in sexual identification issues, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It is like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is in general both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics, (such as muscle mass, hairiness, chest and stature), primary sex characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sex organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and bias-motivated crimes.
Gender non-compliant young boys now have camps specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or “third gender” on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognized as “neutral” after winning her appeals lawsuit that allows her to keep “unspecified” sex for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F-X for intersex, according to the interior ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition calling for “gender theory” to be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overthrown."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer that sex be assigned to babies at birth.
“The parenting role is stressful enough with no additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the site intended for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, after the beautiful Greek god who had a dual sex.
And barely a decade ago, the medical community saw gender as a slate that can be erased and redesigned.
But now, many are questioning the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when he grows up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender to be malleable.
He enshrined the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals—the way parents raise a child—interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories were controversial.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a sloppy circumcision to have him completely castrated, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “still repeat this pattern.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations said, “[They] are not satisfied with the outcome.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
The doctors couldn’t really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfying life” as a man.
So soon after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, undergoing testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he advocates for the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “calls for labeling and stigmatization.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an ‘indeterminate’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be recognized as third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
The German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should lead at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammogram radiologist in Pittsburgh whose daughter suffers from a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands in a support group, said German law will “empower” parents and children.
Dr. Baratz’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, at the age of 29, Katie is married and interned in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
“The law leaves parents some latitude so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This gives them time to take certain tests and understand them, and a delay before entering "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“It puts children at the heart of the decision and eases the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and that is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta believes his government will last until 2015 despite strong tensions between the left and right in the ruling coalition ahead of the Senate vote to remove Silvio Berlusconi from office.
In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he "firmly intends" to continue governing with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former president of the Council convicted of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his impeachment.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated last October 2 by its refusal to give in to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of shots.
Firefighters called to the scene of the tragedy said they responded to a call reporting "multiple wounded".
"The police are on the scene," the airport said on its Twitter account, as television footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
“There was a shooting,” a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local station showed one person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second person transported in a wheelchair.
The incident occurred around 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 p.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that Terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to immediately confirm whether any of its employees were injured.
All flights to and from the airport were suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza-sces
Israeli tank fire killed a Hamas militant on Thursday and seriously wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip, health service sources said.
A Hamas source said fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli military has merely evoked a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel described as "terrorist" by the Jewish state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign seen as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers to President Barack Obama have considered, in secret, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the highlight of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s highly anticipated 2012 campaign book, “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's close associates had conducted "in-depth group work and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's ouster could help Obama in his re-election as his hopes waned.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, aimed at measuring what effect the replacement of the vice president by former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within the Chicago field headquarters and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president — including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was under consideration.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “did not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I’d looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember, at that time, the president wasn't in shape, and so we were like, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the review "concerted," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to find out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
“Campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on polls and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the possible overhaul.
Although Daley said he did not think the president “was aware” of the possible change, the former secretary general admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived on Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know Biden’s ouster from the presidential list was being considered.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He got the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more we lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” said: “It’s an incredible thing but we’re just getting started in terms of production, and 2g of this stuff costs about <0xC2><0xA3>200.”
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level rises and the ice starts to shine.
We tested it over the last few months and it seemed timely to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice I have created because jellyfish luminescence is worth four times more than gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes pretty good!
The Bristol-based company with Charlie’s experimental approach is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation looks even more ambitious.
He added: “I would really like to develop an invisible ice.”
This is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to do it.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed has died during a tai chi session.
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his hands of musicians slitting the air,” Anderson wrote.
Lou Reed was a tai chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer’s wife also said she had promised her husband, the week before he died, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here over the last few years.
And even if we are city dwellers, it is our spiritual home.
“Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the wonderful joy of life that he had,” she added.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become a little more dim.
In the last two years, I haven’t distributed a single candy and I certainly won’t do it this year.
But the stats show I'm the goose when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party are the trends.
Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects make fury.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the men from Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they weren’t the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs disguised as hotdogs.
When it comes to sweets, you don't glamorize.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go candy hunting in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, don’t tell stories, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don’t want to eat; yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That’s about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery that I haven't figured out yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They carry the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the U.S. that generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes these awesome photos of you pissing on yourself that your friends put on Facebook and you can’t remove and on which a guy you like leaves a nice-headed comment.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and sculpting a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the “baby pumpkin trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pumpkins and didn’t have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that are gently wilting on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get noticed more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 922kg pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bad bank structure with <0xC2><0xA3>38 billion of riskiest assets, a move aimed at relaxing relations with London and accelerating its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the share of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it up in the next three years.
RBS also said it would enter an additional <0xC2><0xA3>4 to <0xC2><0xA3>4.5 billion depreciation allowance over the quarter, a write-off linked to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also said the internal restructuring would free up 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, reinforcing its ability to lend.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would draw a line on the past, with the government being accused in particular of meddling in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90 percent of assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the UK," new CEO Ross McEwan told reporters.
Land Rover Announces Sponsorship of Rally Series
The interior features bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between events.
Bowler Motorsport CEO Drew Bowler said: “Rally fans who join Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try out different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of rally raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called in to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a Cocker Spaniel, had escaped after a non-gravity road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry
Firefighters descended as a reminder along the cliff to recover the dog and save her from certain death
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called to retrieve it safely while perched 15m above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and made a call on social media sites after she disappeared into the career following a minor accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-sighted person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a ledge in the quarry, trapped 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and pulled down to rescue Ruby using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical Rescue Specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's unbelievable that anyone noticed the dog.
Technical Rescue Specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to get away with it.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up; her overall condition was satisfactory, aside from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified to watch the rescue.”
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was amazing to have him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them was absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall but she hasn't moved."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dragged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a vocalist on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He dragged me when I was 18."
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a statement Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said he “categorically denies making any advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Maybe she’s confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, landed at number one on the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question Turkmen Islamist movement
"The backstage support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," the head of Chinese security agencies told a Hong Kong television station, according to a video posted Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC), was speaking in Tashkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization since Monday’s attack.
Chinese police said three Uyghurs from the same family in the Muslim-dominated Xinjiang region, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their gasoline-laden car into the entrance of the Forbidden City in a suicide attack that killed two people and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother were killed in the car fire.
Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, formerly the name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the UN in 2002 among the organizations affiliated with al-Qaeda.
This movement is often blamed by Chinese authorities for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free movement zone in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along the Hadrian's Wall.
While the Strathclyde newspaper did indicate the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and should have been expected).
Neither has anyone said that EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continued non-compliance with the rules would be a slim concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scots.
This is a story that is not one of them.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I first heard the rumour that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
Yet, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland actually follow Europe’s instructions?
Why trade the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties opposing the EU or campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, garnered nearly five million votes in the September federal elections and pulled the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the burden on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments experiencing excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has weighed on its members favourable exchange rates for German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper unease related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-intensive drawback, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is rumbling, especially in France, one of the EU’s great leaders.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy struggling.
As a result, Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, putting the ruling Socialists back in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single anti-currency and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties make a good appearance in these elections, which is quite possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-single currency sentiment in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will come back to something that will look more like the free “Europe of (sovereign) nations” privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will turn a soft spot on the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a small England region (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could agree to a freer European agreement on the condition that we keep our own motto.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
Scotland’s SNP government is – and it should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Getting older earlier
Studies show that African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts think obesity epidemic could be trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter’s breasts and pubic hair begin to grow at age 7 or 8?
At this week’s American Academy of Pediatrics conference in Orlando, Florida, paedoendocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among young Americans and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents — in general, it doesn’t indicate a rapid shift toward full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area, and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight advance in the age of first menstruation over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, compared to 12 three-quarters in 1970.
“Once the breast has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years for the first menstrual period to appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered “early” when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster evolution may warrant tests performed by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first period and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormone treatment are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with medications but recognizes that “controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have their periods.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at age 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school frightened and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories made public about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years that links the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have younger facial and pubic area hairs, the trend toward true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the PAA conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be cautious about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early should be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Tribute to the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, had won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Failing to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have cast their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the global pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac proves himself an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, quits pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich charms in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less glowing clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing-in to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week of tribulations of a folk singer who fails to break through and gets angry with the whole world.
He accepts backwards the replacements on the raised foot in the studios.
Without accommodation, he tours the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who's not here at the right time, who's not a careerist but who's wholesome, with a self-destructive behavior," Ethan Coen, who won several Oscars and Cannes awards with his brother Joel, told reporters.
While Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich Village, that neighborhood of New York that was to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as the journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk writes.
The film then takes on a documentary look, from the dusty music label invaded by unsold 33T inhabited by an old unpayable secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers were performing.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by incorporating a funny character that runs through the film all the time: a beautiful red cat with a cracky look, Llewyn Davis’s makeshift companion.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grown up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country."
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play the guitar,” he said.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to “be considered good,” “hazard can also kickstart someone’s career,” and “more and more today.”
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught up in anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", has died.
He never knew the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times named him “the author of spy novels who knew too much.”
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theater of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically depressed by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was travelling on this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, claimed to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
“Without a doubt between 120 and 150 million all countries combined,” he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of a building on Avenue Foch a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not counting the pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivories brought from the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a packet of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, his Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a de-funded Austrian aristocrat and CIA contract agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, goes after all the villains of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a pestilence of violence and torture.
“I never claimed to be a literary author,” said Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked “like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went there and came back with real, long investigations.”
The father of SAS said "making a kind of geopolitical soap opera".
"I am constantly monitoring my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of AFP, diplomats, people from the services I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitory: thus, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way to Damascus".
In "The Madmen of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in "The Cairo Plot," a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he reported the 4x4 columns of jihadists based in the Malian capital.
I am not a diviner, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM daisy typewriter "of which all parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page with the pen.
On the walls of his office are hanging AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcomed in Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age".
He will not die and will not retire.
No more than I do.
Aircraft manufacturers quarrel about seat widths while big orders are at stake
The dispute is raging among major aircraft manufacturers over the width of the seats of the tourist class on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at this month’s Dubai Airshow.
The conflict concerns the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy class passengers – who are not always the most courted by airlines, but to whom the allocated space is essential to increase efficiencies in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economy classes, but its big U.S. rival Boeing says it should be up to airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted as airplanes seek to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record orders at the November 17-21 event.
The way the seats will be arranged in the rear of the aircraft – in particular, will there be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its refurbished 777X will accommodate 406 people in economy class seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautical giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were able to realize recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, titled "Would you accept this?".
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ commercial director.
As eating habits change, people get fatter, but seats on airplanes have not radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American's weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average 21st-century American’s waist circumference is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the aircraft's newly-named "jet set" circumference was narrower.
Airbus says it has commissioned a study that indicates an extra inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus's seat width figures and says it's not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience does not depend only on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about bringing flexibility to airlines and enabling them to do what they feel they need to do to do their business,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s passenger satisfaction manager.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race for orders of aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $ 700 billion at market price in the coming decades, enough to tilt the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing are both claiming performance per seat in their latest long-haul twin-engine models is 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in unit costs is small compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to house more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, director of Passenger Comfort at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777s suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is driven by the 777’s threat,” said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft vendors traveling around the world even take a meter with them to check out competing configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus had emphasized the need for more customization of cabins by offering wider walkway side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say that its call to the aviation industry to set a size standard for seats is unlikely to succeed, but that it could make forget the 777X sales wave.
Oracle shareholders angered by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but it tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the world's third-largest fortune just crowned by the victory of his boat at the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison received a negative vote on his salary.
The Oracle boss forgot a $1.2 million bonus for the fiscal year 2013 ended in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but received about $77 million related to stock-options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
For the full fiscal year 2013, Oracle’s net profit rose 3.5% while the stock price jumped 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which took 24% at the same time.
New Nicotine Vaccine Could Suppress Smoking Pleasure
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice for life from nicotine dependence.
More tests are needed before starting human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to develop anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a steady flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his or her dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice that were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated “were calmed down,” the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have proven ineffective because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be repeated so frequently that the antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use is completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the findings were interesting but noted that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, security services said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in the strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone fire," a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a trip to London, informed the British government that talks had been started with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state’s anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a cafe, after they expired in August 2005, without a bidding process.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following testimony by Mr. Tripodi's former assistant secretary general, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government lobbied for leases to be tendered.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, leases for Circular Quay companies, which earned the Obeid about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tendering.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, admitted Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented at ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the topic discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?" Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don’t remember what we talked about, but it wasn’t that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official told Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass an “authenticity” test
The government is currently studying the possibility of setting up an “authenticity test” for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa as it considers extending the crackdown.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion intended to prevent 457 visas from being used for unqualified positions or as a misguided means of bringing family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced government discourse on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“The overwhelming statements about ‘foreigners coming back to the end of the line’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant comeback to a time when unions were demanding a protected labor market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of whites had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion paper outlines the 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, with the others under consideration.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to see “whether the job offer is genuine in the event that the applicant is a relationship or a personal partner of the owner or the person concerned within the company that sponsors it.”
Companies may also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, have actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker has reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man’s 9-year-old son was traveling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father’s death Wednesday from an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the UK government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would “bring the UK together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “excited” to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government raised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to consider strengthening railway capacity and improving journey times for Northern England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our focus for HS2 is on a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support "unequivocally" the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "High-speed rail has the potential to deliver considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight to the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to explore options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating a benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh route that the Scottish Government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the UK ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps.”
Rules for the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will have to continue turning off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to loosen regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases as long as they are in “airplane” mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it distressing to not be able to access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
The Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that obliges U.S. carriers to do significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but pointed out that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in airplanes,” she said.
The issue is the subject of regulations that require aircraft operators to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, which has previously spoken to CASA about its intention to expand the use of its in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said it would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we truly believe it would improve the customer experience now that we have [the in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology] on our aircraft,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas has said it complies with the current rules for the time being.
“In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we have no immediate intention of changing that,” she said.
The FAA’s decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA’s decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In the rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under seats or in upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people, according to testimonies...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a brawl involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four minor injuries would be regrettable.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s underwriting lenders benefit from middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawn lender in Singapore’s Bendemeer Mall, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a gold bracelet, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters’ tuition fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as a manager and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it transacted, this week became the third pawn lending company to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
To pledge jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in Mrs. Amirthalinga’s case – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, pledged lenders in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pledge lenders have the advantage of not asking for credit checks or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pledged lenders as families experience the pressure of rising costs of living and over-indebted households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pledged lenders to bridge the gap as their economies slow down.
This week, rating agency Standard & Poor’s cited rising household debt, stemming mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt-to-gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about Thailand’s high level of consumer debt, which just emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or at the bottom [of the wage scale] are looking to supplement their incomes as they can,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have made people rush to pledge their personal belongings to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the pledged items in the city-state’s 200 pledged lending shops are made of gold.
People say, “The price of gold is high, let’s pledge the grandmother’s gold chain and we’ll come back for it next month.”
In Thailand, the largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
ValueMax, the operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, plans to grow not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its CEO.
The company will fund them using 60% of the $66 million it raised this week at its Singapore Stock Exchange IPO.
While some low-rate lenders have been criticized for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah says the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
“Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property doesn’t increase household debt,” she says.
The pledge is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed short-term financing.
The people who go to the pledge lenders are not only those who have financial problems either.
The wealthy in Singapore also go to ValueMax pawnshops to pledge gold bullion or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“It can be affluent people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses that have cash needs to make a difficult journey,” adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who cared for young people in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor officiated, said it was deeply saddened by the news.
In a statement, church officials said Hudgins had resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with people under 18 years of age and not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He Goes to the Supermarket in Nazi Uniform Before He Gets Evicted
A man in a Nazi uniform with a swastika armband was asked to leave an English supermarket, with customers complaining to the management of the establishment who called the police, the store said Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," a spokeswoman for supermarket chain Asda said.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "by the time they arrived, he had already left without scolding," she added.
I was standing in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
The people were speechless.
“You don’t go out on the street like that unless you want to get attention,” a 60-year-old client, Rosina Rusin, told Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween, when it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
“I have been wearing an SS black armband twice a week for three years at Asda,” Dutton said, explaining that he was suffering from “mental problems.”
$325M Rescue Plan for Tasmania’s Health System
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout for the faltering health care system has strict conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent action” to end a crisis caused by the island state’s aging population, high rates of chronic diseases and systemic constraints.
The funding, planned for four years, was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopedic surgery and cataract surgery, will help catch up.
Funding is also provided for appointment-free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved outpatient care, training of medical executives, mental health services, and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments reflect the view of first-line clinicians that this is the best way to care for Tasmania's health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it is spending the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much “unless it is followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmania’s public health system.”
However, he commended the government for responding to the urgent request it submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope the federal aid plan will make a significant contribution to removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "lucky solution."
“The reason we’re here is that the state’s Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system,” he told ABC TV.
We can't have a state government that's taking out nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that's putting in $300 million, and pretend it's a big day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts remarkable artistic direction and meticulous period reconstruction, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Superior Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into the lubricity or sensationalism, and that is the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, surveillance body says
Syria has destroyed equipment critical to the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes rage in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day ahead of the deadline.
On 1 November, the Hague-based organization ordered Damascus to destroy or “make unusable” all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important milestone in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting rageed Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The group of activists, which follows the evolution of the human toll thanks to a network of activists based in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, there were an estimated 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, including 18,678 fighters from pro-government forces and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Of those killed, an estimated 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 were opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that figure since.
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad's troops have been fighting rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war, within tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which is working closely with the UN, said its team was “now satisfied with having controlled – and destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling.”
She added that "no other inspection activities are planned at this time."
Earlier in the week, the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to safety concerns, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I commend the moral strength and courage that you have all shown as part of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” Ahmet Uzumcu, the organization’s director-general, said in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits the Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are backed by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger at the sentencing of one of the Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted with anger to the sentence imposed on the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Tuesday for his role in making explosive devices used in the bombings.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass killing for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He has also been convicted of many other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have asked for life imprisonment, yet they could have asked for the man, dubbed “Demolition Man” for his reputation as an expert in bomb making, to be sentenced to death.
The decision rekindled painful memories for June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men.
"He should be dragged to the firing squad," Corteen told the PAA.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He sank into a coma the day after the attack and was unconscious for a month, and died three times while under respiratory assistance.
Hugues said Patek should have suffered the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terror cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to restore ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he made fun of the grief he might have caused other people.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” Corteen said.
Patek, however, can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board planes (but not make a call with their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices door-to-door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music — but not talk on their mobile phones — under the highly anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will need to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the crew training manuals and aircraft storage rules to comply.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them back on until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives the green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft during the descent of the aircraft before landing and not turn them back on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, the FAA said.
Most of the new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with the changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will benefit everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be banned from connecting to the internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS, or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was ejected with great noise from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones is the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered to be at risk.
“Mobile phones are truly a problem, not only because they could eventually create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid safety reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers carried FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
New airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and are FAA-approved.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also better at resisting interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally transmit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only broadcast minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for a loosening of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, company executives loaded an airliner with Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This inspired mixed feelings among members of the FAA Advisory Committee as to whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them common sense arrangements for technology-enabled travelers.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicoptered bird from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, helicoptered after being found depleted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water rake was flown aboard a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before it was rebuilt by the Scottish SPCA at its Alloa Rescue Centre.
The center’s director, Colin Seddon, said: “This stream of water was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help.”
The water was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and define what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions across the UK.
The findings of the investigation will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than getting stuck in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe’s institutional arcana.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders feel that control of these key competencies should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused general discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives to change the treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the corporate world insists on a “significant change” that restores power in the UK.
The stakes are high – succeeding in changing the treaty and better representing Britain’s interests would see a 16% drop in votes in favour of the country remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this investigation shows that British companies are supporting this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will constitute a significant shift in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means re-emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not departed from the Halloween tradition.
Last night, he and his wife handed out treats to hundreds of children at the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the parties have rebounded.
In New York, thousands of costumed people took part in the parade organized in the neighborhood of "Greenwich village".
Everyone is overexcited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.
We have fun like crazy, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
It's good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller says Bulgaria’s gas pipeline ushers in a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's director said.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe’s largest large-scale project,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify export routes from Russia to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, the country through which the bulk of Russian gas destined for Europe transits, raises the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director adds.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project goes into service in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the daily Les Nouvelles de Tahiti, taking a report from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if we count three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutineers, an episode in the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live in Pitcairn, and their income is 95% dependent on London's generosity.
The Council of the island voted unanimously in favor of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836,000 km2 that correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate the request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuaryize these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to ensure its surveillance, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, neighbouring Pitcairn.
The FAA eases restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft – but it will still be banned from making calls on mobile phones.

Life imprisonment for former Chinese deputy governor
A former deputy governor of Jilin province in northeastern China was sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of hitting more than 19 million yuan in bribes, official Chinese media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the president of Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing’s first intermediate court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made fighting corruption a national priority, saying the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state has promised that justice will be as intractable with the powerful “tigres” as with the “flies” – the subordinate officials – only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted, among them former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest levels of government.
But the government has in no way expressed its intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, a party-independent body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two YMCA employees in New South Wales were charged with sexual assault against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it had “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education instructor was convicted of sexually assaulting children at the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, Counsel to the Board, that he was aware of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was inaccurate by pointing out, “External controls of the YMCA were performed and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings on four institutions during a Department of Education and Communities quality audit conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare dismissed the YMCA's claim that there was a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures to ensure the safety of children.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them private, had them sit on his knees, told them that he liked them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was mentored by Lord and had applied for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said she found YMCA Caringbah Child Services Manager Jacqui Barnat to be "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected staff testimonies that they were reluctant to report these breaches to their supervisor.
Instead, he said that the friendly relationship they had with Lord has clouded their judgment, which is why they have not reported his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his views to the board of the YMCA of New South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson learned from "the Jonathan Lord incident" should not be about "reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by YMCA Director General for Children's Services Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence on children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, monitoring, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister again, but acknowledged that his return was unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since leaving in June 2007 after a decade at the helm of the country, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of prime minister, Blair reportedly replied, according to the London Evening Standard: “Yes, of course, but it may likely happen, so...”
When many equestrian experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old, to win.
Not yet in school and just a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted through the three rounds with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparables – who are the same size – were hailed for presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Standing up against men and women in stylish melon hats, he wore his flat cap a bit on the side in a casual way to parade his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his uncommon natural training qualities for a child his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee make a great duo.”
They presented themselves against each other, but both of them grazed the golden cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were thrilled he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has participated in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging and applauding it.”
He ran the entire length of the track and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares for.
From the way he started, he’ll surely be attending the Horse of the Year event soon – and I’m sure he’ll make a great performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They make a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they paraded on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he really looked great.
A Chinese newspaper that issued a call "will be overhauled"
A Chinese newspaper that has launched a front page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be overhauled, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete overhaul,” the regulator said.
The order for "redesign" was issued by the Guangdon Administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News group, published several erroneous articles about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Express editorial staff was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided “to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.”
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the people responsible for New Express and immediately overhaul the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express about the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories for money.
"In this case, I harmed Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to win public trust," he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was chasing money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published its apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in harbor.
The leak of radioactive steam detected on one of the two nuclear boilers of the Charles-de-Gaulle, in mid-October and while the ship was at sea, was "safe for sailors", but is not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal confirmed that the ship was unavailable until "mid-November", "time to take corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a specialist in naval defense, assures that its teams and those of Areva, sent to the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
This involves, among other things, changing a pump on the faulty boiler room.
"Everything is being done so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," DCNS explains, however.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not in any way call into question the program of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier is out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had sailed from Toulon in mid-October for a training session.
This, in particular, with a view to qualifying young fighter pilots.
A "small breakdown", confined to the containment space of the reactor, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, deluge of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative expenses to finish.
In short, limitless siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of squandered dollars could be saved in order to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all the major companies, we do not bother with sumptuous expenses and the maintenance of lame ducks: deficit cultural center, large subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they may be sold to a private company or demolished.
It is also saddening to see the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honorable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
It is not the public that invests in such companies, but the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the Fishery and Pile Lakes will continue to supply the city with clean water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the great decline in the population, water use has declined significantly throughout the territory.
Not to mention wasting it, the city will never run out of water and the strict regulations on its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be embarrassed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been run for more than 40 years by ties with beautiful degrees for the most part and I don't think a sheep farmer does worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities have described the 4-foot-by-3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagging about the length of nearly six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, making it easy to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if they are convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels who must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railway tracks that started from the kitchen of a Tijuana home and went as far as two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant for Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a “notice of surrender” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would likely be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sex crime, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow him to move to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asks him to report to a police station, on the date and time of his choice," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after unveiling more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website battling secret information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
Finished the passwords to enter to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will make it possible to ascertain the identity of a person performing transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
Privacy organizations confirm this craze for biometrics, but are concerned.
In 2011 alone and in France, the Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés authorized 774 systems for recognizing fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will make it possible to provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the outline of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
"For example, some people who work the concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - we cannot capture these data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out over the last twenty years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of the sensors and the computing capacity of the computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
Accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, says Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we’re researching voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
A unique and unfalsifiable marker, DNA also arouses hope and concern.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Foresight at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who he or she claims to be).
The identification so far concerned the issuance of identity papers: it is necessary to compare the biometric elements (fingerprints, photo, iris) with the information that the State has on all citizens already registered.
This helps to ensure that a person does not try to impersonate someone else.
This comparison principle may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance to a hotel or store.
“We retrieve the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of celebrities who circulate freely on the Internet,” explains Dany Nassif, in charge, at NEC France, of commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: taking a picture of a quidam standing in line in a store, tracking his progress through facial recognition and calculating the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the friend pointing for another," justifies Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain vendors by introducing your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the keystroke of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in-store with his credit card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French traders.
Tips to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the box thirty seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you tailor-made options.
And, finally, reassuring by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
“Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people’s identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure enclosure, which crashes if you try to move it,” lists Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, for lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these discourses really convince users.
However, privacy specialists continue to be concerned.
“The advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was inflicted an almond of <0xC2><0xA3>1,000
A motorist was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they found the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the required caution and care.
The seven points removed from his licence led to a 6-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a victim surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
A tax on foreign property owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne who, in Budget 2012, recorded a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own properties as part of a corporation rather than as an individual.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the arrondissements of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and amounts to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 fiscal year, exceeding the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and the Yorkshire and Humber Region combined.
Mr. Cook said: “Following the increase in the stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on the matter, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are undertaxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system.”
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestigious real estate – the 5-10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the thriving southwest London sector stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London are growing steadily year-on-year by 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a fast-growing “domestic market,” with the city’s southwest (7.4%) and northeast (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills’ studies.
Scientists have just shed light on how a dog’s tail movements are related to his mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs moved their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved their tail more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to see what was going on with other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain is responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to other dogs’ disordered tail movements, the researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented dogs with films featuring other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor – and we were able to manipulate the movement of the tail and present it as going further left or right.”
When the animals saw an expressionless dog stirring its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog stirring its tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail deviating mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you meet other dogs repeatedly and you notice that, most of the time, moving their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience.”
The researchers say the findings could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their animals’ emotions.
Canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said this is not the first study to look at the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads left when they looked at an aggressive dog and right when it was a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs went more easily to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study.”
He said the differences could come from the fact that the dogs that participated in the different studies did not fully consider movie animals or robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Although many evidence, found in different mammals, indicates that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after their singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was scheduled to perform Friday at The Hydro concert hall in downtown.
However, her laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reschedule the show.
The announcement came after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1st."
Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will take place on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the most senior churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – it is therefore up to a group of 120 “cardinal electors”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting gathering all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope in general appointed as many cardinals as it took for the number of cardinal electors to reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year’s consistory will be important as it will be the first since Pope Francis’ election in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a sort of tendency to favour Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be elected since Francis formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided on his own.
“Francis has now chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was “quite possible” for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero indicated that popes generally elect bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will appoint.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the U.S. to repair seat backs
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with manually tilting backrests, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is hit from the rear, the headrest may not properly protect passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website said.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The rollout of GM’s pickups began in June and represents the most significant vehicle launch for the largest U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM notified pickup owners of the defect during the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the owners' newsletter due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which have been redesigned for the 2014 model, grew about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's share price rose 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred around 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been taking place there for some time.
A wall of adjoining foundation had just been erected over the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site to retrieve his tools.
“I was driving past and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke,” said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We could only see part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation maneuvers were attempted by the emergency services, but were unsuccessful.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change
He says Obama made laudable efforts thwarted by Republican Party obstructionism
The obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I’m reading a very sad book these days.
It is a book that I thought would encourage me during the late second year of medicine and give me hope.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s the memoirs of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and I went to bed, this book takes me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and news anchors took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cried for joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% favorable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it’s like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our military, to the end of “not seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration in front of my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks on innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the impeachment of whistleblowers who reveal the misdeeds of the government.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the exceedance of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the election function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of the administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term and freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that have been heard for so long.
Yet, while the favorable opinion index has plunged below 45% this week, it’s even harder to get back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me crave the many promises that have fled.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to refocus on our talent,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
Five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescue, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who is challenging the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has argued this to try to rule out questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be lifted.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were prepared to personally benefit from these policies.
“He will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the election commission officially declared that Palmer won Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of a reshuffle of the voting system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why couldn’t we have a system where you can enter, enter your contact information into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered options for e-voting and recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties “very seriously.”
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We’re not looking for a reward, except the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he said.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientific mission officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Environments (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Is the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprising you?
This is good news, but I am not particularly surprised.
While in the past species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographic basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in the science of species classification.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being challenged due to advances in genetics.
In the same way, two species that are very close morphologically have been distinguished through genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this a significant discovery, as the Wildlife Conservation Society has stated?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time to the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only at this location.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local extinction of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered depending on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e., the stock, and the possibility that it has to recover from neighboring stocks.
As for Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the newly discovered species is derived, its stock has automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This mixing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well known.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research and it’s high time that changed.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division, according to two sources familiar with the matter, showing once again that the global investigation by regulators into suspected foreign exchange market manipulations is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations of the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the broadening of the investigation that echoes the scandal over manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said RBS had transmitted email and instant messaging files, sent to and from a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European head of cash trading for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of spot foreign exchange trading at Citi, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources familiar with the case added.
UBS said this week it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations made concerning bankers who allegedly agreed to manipulate rates in the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources familiar with the matter said.
Banks have been scouring instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news of these investigations has shaken traders in an industry that has been one of the biggest growth drivers for investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been called into question this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast, highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at a low cost.”
The news came the same day Credit Suisse announced that it had fired a trader working in its London Stock Exchange traded funds office this week after it caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly notified the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case has been controlled,” said a representative of Credit Suisse.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation has been sloppy, lawyer says
After police confirmed they had gotten a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby claimed to have never seen an investigation “so sloppy.”
Ruby said she believed the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford’s friend and occasional driver, 35-year-old Alexander Lisi, and accused him of extortion related to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court documents indicate.
Ruby called it “inexplicable” that police never searched Rob Ford’s vehicle or his home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Chief of Police Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford’s vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search – even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Ruby’s remarks an “obvious and desperate attempt” to press the media in a case that did not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" for filing a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stocks down in mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are trading down Friday mid-session, plummeted by some news of disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
On the other hand, investors remain cautious as they believe that the US Federal Reserve could unlock its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the entire euro area, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relax its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures are predicting an upward opening in U.S. stocks after two consecutive sessions of downturns.
At values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest fall of the CAC 40, led by the warning on result of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26 percent) posted the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also publishing lower results this morning and announcing the creation of an internal "bad bank" structure with 38 billion pounds of riskiest assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the top of the EuroFirst300 rises in reaction to a press report that AT&T is considering a possible takeover.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation about the evolution of the ECB’s monetary policy is well underway, as John Hardy, strategist at Saxo Bank, shows.
The ECB’s single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week’s meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the euro to fall.
In this context, the euro continues its downturn against the US currency and hit a two-week low at $1.3517.
These same conjectures support the euro area bond market in reverse.
Supreme Court approves Obama's health care reform law
Big win for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health care reform law ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, otherwise they will have to pay a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government’s taxing power.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four most liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and further considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the threshold of eligibility for Medicaid must be lowered under penalty of losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
Proceedings to block the law were initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican presidential candidates in the 2012 primaries, including nominee Mitt Romney, have vehemently opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as numerous patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and the deceased of all wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Deputy Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Israeli-Palestinian clash at Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday evening during a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip has ceased operation on Friday after a depletion of its fuel stocks, the Palestinian enclave’s energy authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another cadre of the Hamas armed wing, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell fired during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigade officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred meters into the territory before retreating thereafter.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell while defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupier in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
“Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier,” the spokesman said.
For its part, the Israeli army said the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and destined, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, saying the aim was to kidnap Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device targeting IDF forces (the Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel struck an air military base in northwestern Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, the satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported on Thursday.
A U.S. official confirmed an “Israeli strike” but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he said.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" it did not name, the Saudi-owned channel said that "the bombing targeted a cargo of surface-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, had reported several explosions heard at dawn Wednesday at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, relying on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, advances, in profile, thin as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple trait, takes its shape.
And this shape will be that of the whole room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, entirely dressed in black, only hands and face uncovered, wait on either side of the playground, rush when the next letter appears, embody it, come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in relay of solos, in group in unison (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Glory of the Morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, posed online in the forescene.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux’s poem, monochord and monotonous in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to start again, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like those hairs that crumble or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet the work of Michaux, has imposed itself, with its tics.
As a result, the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’s inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a broader and more porous imagination than dance.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches the magic.
The public liked it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after the intermission, is richer.
The scene is partly draped in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a neglected house.
At the piano, dancers take turns to play the scores.
Their clumsiness in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in romantic duets, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small solos of transitions, ensembles that move, choirs, writing is less binary.
Clowns appear, also familiar to Chouinard, with a red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnivores, fugitives or gamers.
The gestures, the laughter and the small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the bodies in coitus, of the beings that merge.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored overlap, the dancers cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloat, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness permeate, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei face lawsuit over Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents began an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone makers, including Google, the company it haired at the stake during the patent auction that took place after Nortel went bankrupt.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising related to search terms on the Internet, said the trial findings, which is Google's core business.
It was not possible to reach the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial $900 million bid for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally offer $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel's patents to Rockstar, Google later acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola's patent library.
“Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, it has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the court said.
Rockstar is seeking greater damages against Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother allegedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which left two seriously injured Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a faulty water heater, the King's prosecutor's deputy said Friday night.
The expert sent to the scene by the prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a build-up of gas.
The life-threatening prognosis of the two victims is still compromised.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying at his grandfather’s house and his girlfriend, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and conditioned at the scene before being taken to the Liège University Hospital, she by helicopter, he by ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters from Andenne and Namur and the police of Les Arches intervened.
Crisnée Civil Protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt Asks First Freely Elected President to Take Oath
Mohamed Morsi took the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he took the oath of office, becoming the first freely elected president to succeed Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore an oath before the 18 black-robed judges of the court whose Nile-border building was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old U.S.-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group seen for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to applaud the new president and, detaching themselves from the presidential brilliance of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the busy streets connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Considered the Muslim Brotherhood’s uncharismatic “backup wheel,” his personal prestige has grown considerably since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun in the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi said in a blue suit and red tie, addressing judges in the wooden hall where he was sworn in.
Later, Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was on guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand..." sung by thousands of people gathered in the large amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi swore a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime began last year, and vowed to regain the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, dispossessed him of.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he bows to the will of the army, showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the US has slowed the rise of the automotive market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal administrations weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, according to figures released Friday by automakers, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
Detroit’s three major automakers are showing double-digit growth from October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million sales at annualized and seasonally adjusted rates, but the market stood at 15.3 million, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank’s customers, he believes that this slight brake is explained in the first place by “the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month”.
GM, however, reported a nearly 16% increase in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, up from 211,563 expected by the consensus.
All four of the group’s brands saw their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pickups, saw its sales increase by 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
Fiat-controlled Chrysler, for its part, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, up from 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted sales below consensus, despite year-over-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM shares gained 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford sold 1.1%.
Renault plunged into the stock market by Nissan's warning
Renault on Friday experienced its biggest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor said it had cut its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20 percent, traders said.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle of its management.
Several traders reported that the Renault stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
“This is clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” said a Paris broker’s trading manager.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of France, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two dead in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured Friday night by gunshots fired by two people on a motorcycle passing a Neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party venue in the western suburbs of Athens, police said.
The police were not yet in a position to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn claimed that the victims were guards at their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Counter-terrorism police rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place, and sealed the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after six Golden Dawn MPs, including the party's leader and founder, were indicted for participating in a "criminal organization" as part of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two matches of the Champions League of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Barça for directing a blow to Neymar, the Scottish midfielder has seen his suspension extended to three matches by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes across the province were deprived of electricity shortly after noon on Friday due to strong winds hitting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected areas are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The greater Montreal area is also experiencing its share of outages with nearly 7,000 homes without power in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecast upwards and expects record results from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to achieve an underlying profit for the full year between $325 million and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12% to 17% growth from the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
Chief Executive Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8% profit in the first half and that the second half had started in strength, particularly with respect to non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results for the entire year before deducting interest and taxes,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half, offsetting a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure travel sector performed well while business customers spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half of the year, when seasonal demand was weaker and was expected to make a year-round profit for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Strangers shoot at hotel near Cairo pyramids
Unknown hooded men opened fire on Friday at a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without causing any casualties, the result of an apparent dispute with dismissed employees.
The attackers fled, Interior Ministry spokesman Gen. Abdel Latif said.
The attack comes as Egypt has hardly received any tourists since the army overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloody crackdowns on demonstrations by his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of the English Literature courses, students will be required to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also introduce "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Beginning in 2015, students will be required to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
He will make changes in other key areas next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Regulatory Office of Examinations, will unveil a redesign of the structure of the GCSE, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking over the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was a “wide consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence,” stressing that the CSEGs would be “more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools devote less time to math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singaporean students do about 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that deeper math GCSE – as well as greater emphasis on subjects in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to deliver more hours of classes.
The programme will focus more on "real-world problems", including financial mathematics.
This ruling means that a bill passed in July in that state and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a rifle at Muy for Halloween
Minors ages 9 and 13 went door to door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy neighborhood visited by children opened the door holding his shotgun.
The 86-year-old told gendarmes he was scared.
His weapon has been seized.
Former Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever being traced, was actually buried in a mass grave at a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave at the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he told the daily newspaper, drawing on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime, would answer one of the great puzzles of the Post-War era.
The German intelligence service, the BND, thus assured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was completely wrong.
"From August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando," according to Tuchel.
He was wearing a "general's uniform".
"In the left inner pocket were his service records with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the Berlin City Hall of the Mitte district stating that he was buried in the neighborhood’s Jewish cemetery.
The president of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is crudely trampled on," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller was one of the leading figures of the Third Reich who had never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his command Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

He walks through mud, jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon’s villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or on your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to vote him “CNN Hero of the Year.”
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one arm broken, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma of which he was going to carry the sequelae for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Bwelle said.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” Mr. Bwelle adds.
You can leave the house at 5:00, rush to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the country’s health spending is in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Dr. Bwelle said.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 free surgical procedures over the past year.
He became a physician himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he has created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they pile up in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to get to the villages that need help the most.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best housing available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people at each visit,” said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this travelling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a collected pair of glasses or a free birth certificate – a document necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school, town hall or house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the wake-up room to give his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a tiresome pace, but the musicians in the villages usually help the team stay motivated.
“They beat drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical procedures for free over the past year, and they know that their presence can make all the difference for those they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to supporting this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, that finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so that he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity for field learning that they don't have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help sponge the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their boarding, transportation and teaching are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt about it,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not about to die out.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle added.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons that drive me to do this.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and situate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in amphitheaters and classrooms?
No doubt, but highlighting his weakness for crossroads, Sciences-Po, High Studies.
Arbiter of the works of others in his office at Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.
Heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Certainly also, but knowing that such a sacred cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which has passed.
They readily recognized him as a great awakener, animator and federator of their work, but pointing out that he was unwilling to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Lieux de mémoire", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked tongues were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a quick glance and weighed down by scholarship, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who passed for not writing had much and well written.
This book should definitely do him justice.
Yet we find, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual wandering, jubilation set to leap as if on foot from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the dealer back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: this is a period concern.
A few years ago, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at the time, the French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is chasing is completely different.
He does not pose as the heir of an eternal frankness, he refuses the definition.
Analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of a rebuke, tormented by irritating questions.
Of which this, which is born of the enterprise itself: why, in a country so permanently settled within its borders, so formerly framed and solidly masonry, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to ward off the turmoil born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits the national history in two.
Since the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not succeed in denying it; on the contrary, it was concerned with regaining its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility because it had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And hence an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity felt, nothing beats the four steps out of France, so much so that Pierre Nora’s American getaway could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousinship only better emphasizes what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men cluttered with an Ancient Indigenous Regime, and all the more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here it has sown drama and confided.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here revolutionary ancestors whose role models are difficult to make, and who have otherwise killed each other.
There is an institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, as many mistakes to be made up and attempts to be made again.
The France that goes, the France that comes
There was, however, a time when the French believed they could sew the torn dress of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
In this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscurely prepared modern France and proposing them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity has only had a time.
Here it is again in debate, shaken by a new kind of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France leaving and the cautious sketch of France coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We find out that the fireplace was a homemaker.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The scavenger was standing in the center of the center.
And he who had laid down, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of nation, but had evaded the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will finally have done it.
Certainly in a less stiff, more exploded and more subtle form.
But make no mistake about it, just as constraining.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Abducted in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the association for the defense of hostages "Otages du monde", which he has presided over for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for hostages to file complaints and bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, a former reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
On the night of your release, you were on the set of the 20h of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
Especially in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it is dark - Roger Auque.
He tells me we're free, but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They drop us off on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the Summerland hotel site where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the French embassy.
This is the time of the first calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there as we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boards.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We landed in Orly.
Chirac, the Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible upheaval.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I'll be back and there's plenty of them.
The descent of the staircase of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull themselves to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do a little police to prevent some from climbing.
The media pressure is enormous.
It does not stop, we are well placed to know it...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We come out of a hole and suddenly we're under fire.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to handle.
But we did the hardest.
The same night, I'm at 8 p.m., the next day I'm on TV too.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for a month or two that is a bit like a holiday.
How were the medical exams and the DGSE debriefing?
I had my first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grâce the days after my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage-takers.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I listen to what's being said.
The issue of ransoms, in particular.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I'm trying to sort things out between questions about my past as a hostage and my "hostages of the world" president's cap that allows me to put some distance, and I find it much more interesting to approach.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight, along with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a semantic problem.
The taking of hostages must be described as a "political" act, which is often the case, and hostages must be allowed access to justice, complaints and hostage-takers to be brought before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages may also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why not say to the hostage-takers "you have violated the rules of war, as those of all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, justified, legitimate, struck by common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists take to the streets to denounce Morsi trial
Anger erupts in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of deposed President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial underlines this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet with him, and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial if a pro-Morsi rises, it is he who is supposed to have Sisi tried, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, and 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed outside the Cairo police academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses nine U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, “all military spouses are entitled to a Department of Defense ID card and the benefits that come with it,” the minister recalled in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The slingshot of the nine states began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on Texas National Guard settlements, due to a conflict between Texas law and the federal law on same-sex marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage at about 5,600 people active, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the Bump association’s SK8 Unity section, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on-site on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will start in the wake, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled for 3 p.m. and the awards ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young heroes Lorenzo Palumbo.
At just 10 years old, he has already won his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he doesn’t like anything so much as showing it to competitors who surpass him by three heads.
Toronto mayor chases journalists who came to question him about a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugging, according to several media outlets.
A video released to the courts seems to support these suspicions.
The man, Rob Ford, has always denied using crack, while acknowledging a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he drove several journalists from his property to question him.
We also think that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced Thursday that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, obviously of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and he died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and treat people who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28," the ministry of health and agriculture said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
Departments are now calling on people who were bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin injured by this kitten or whose animal was in contact with this kitten between October 8 and 28 to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from November 1.
"As France has been rabies-free since 2001, this kitten or mother was imported from another country, not rabies-free," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture clarifies that the last "autochthonous" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from the Gambia was recorded in 2008.
"Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," the departments said, and it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama backtracks on health care reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama yesterday reversed his unambiguous and often repeated promise that “if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “a rush of news” about the terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received these notices to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better-suited health plans for the same price, or even less than expected.
“You will win,” he said.
The Administration has announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who take out their own insurance find themselves forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius told the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the October launch of the online marketplace had failed “miserably.”
“I’m as frustrated and irritated as anyone,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this phrase, while she believed her microphone cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her during yesterday's Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, Missouri Republican representative, on whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long kept asking Ms. Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel launches special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky winner, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and warmth at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula One world champion, trained for the free practice of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose design was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from 1,500 drawings sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automobile brand, of his team.
He was invited to watch the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his booth.
Vettel was expected to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, at trials.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, destined to score his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party from the suburbs
Let's not be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the suburbs" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of suburbs, I speak to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his hometown of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My proposal No. 1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, now claims to be "100% apolitical", although he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are linked to the left, but if the people of the right are willing to support me, I will listen to them too.
I don't talk to extremist parties.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program -consultable on the Internet- from many themes supposed to speak to suburban residents and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16, the rehabilitation of the function of building keeper...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this is likely to be fair, he acknowledges.
It's a matter of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven headliners in metropolitan France and Martinique.
“And the support emails I’ve been receiving since yesterday don’t all come from the suburbs,” he said.
John Kerry has admitted, an unprecedented fact, that American espionage “has gone too far in an inappropriate way.”
John Kerry indicated a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States towards its surveillance programs by admitting, an unprecedented fact, that on several occasions, the espionage “had gone too far inappropriately”.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, ruled on “autopilot” when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities surfaced.
The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government became aware of certain things in autopilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course September 11th."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is committed to trying to clarify and make it clear to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels deceived.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to get blown up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have indeed prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the United States, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about threats they had made regarding a possible withdrawal of counter-terrorism organizations due to the sense of frustration oversight by the National Security Agency.
“It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in our mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate’s European Affairs Subcommittee, said in an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger provoked by the NSA’s programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some US allies, however the agency’s director said this week that it was inaccurate and a misunderstanding as it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations included documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
The director of intelligence services, James Clapper, justified spying on the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy said his office was organizing a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and he hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and both houses.
The names of other participating legislators are expected to be released in the coming days.
He said the route had yet to be determined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “affective firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programs they have been running themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to spy,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Kerry has planned to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with the resentment generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plagued by poor results from Shell and the day after an announcement by the Fed of its continued support for the economy, as expected.
Australian woman appeals jail sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the whole story.
She was detained in a cell at the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women’s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We obviously had a distressing time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years in prison and an incarceration in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore its deteriorating image among tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.

The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had any intention of going to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has announced that measures have been taken to allow arrests or even police custody," Marie Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and members of the education staff, to think about ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
The organization Vision diversité has been walking around schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are native or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects so that they identify with all of this,” explains A<0xC3><0xAF>da Kamar, president of Vision Diversity.
Michel Venne, from the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support to staff in the transformations that we live, within the student clientele," he enumerates.
The school board Marguerite-Bourgeoys has created a research center that will give tools to teachers who, sometimes, also come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the Scientific Director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
“Different pedagogical strategies, that’s the real need,” she summarizes.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
