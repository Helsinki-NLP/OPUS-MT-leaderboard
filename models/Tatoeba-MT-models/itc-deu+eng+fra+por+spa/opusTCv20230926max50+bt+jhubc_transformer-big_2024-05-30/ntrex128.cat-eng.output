Members of the Welsh assembly concerned that "they will be identified as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposal to modify its title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen as a result of the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure could become a cause for mockery.
A member of the Labour party's assembly said his party was concerned that the MWP "rejected with Twp or Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the party assembly Plaid Cymru has commented that his party as a whole "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh Conservative member claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but also commented that there is too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it should be noted that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
According to the committee of the assembly in charge of drawing up the legal draft to introduce the changes of names: "The final decision on any qualifier to appoint the members of the assembly will of course fall on the members themselves".
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives the Assembly of Wales all power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee opted for "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" is the one that received broader support in the public consultation.
Apparently, members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach a consensus can be quite a headache for Assembly President Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly shall hold the final vote on its name during the debate related to the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change name of country
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was decided in an attempt to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country’s attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those in favor, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Stop Ringing: The Difficulties of Harlem Churches
“Historically, the older people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there’s none of them left.”
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
“People have a different way of socializing today,” he says.
“The bars are no longer that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people used to go periodically.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders anticipate "and that sooner or later they will return to the place where they came from".
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who will not be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and so what they will do will be to speed up the closure of all churches, as it is quite unlikely that the majority of people who move into these condominiums will end up being members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired ownership of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the chimney.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly described the chime as "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who sounded the carillon in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest carillon in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded at St. Martin's in recent months, on the other hand, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing its concern that the diocese "intended to transmit the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy While Searching for Locusts in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving to look for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving for half an hour with some friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help. They then rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was the joy of having caught a lobster, but then "realized he was yelling 'I've been bitten!
They bit me!"
He had his entire collarbone torn," Hammel observed as he reached the boy.
“To get everyone out of the water, I shouted, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, lifeguard Larry Giles commented that he worked a few weeks that a shark had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours because of the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty products aisles in the style of department stores occupied with specialized employees.
These large aisles are only part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty market, a market that moves around <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as the fashion and household goods sectors lag behind, and will be tested at 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year if the test becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space on their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also receive more space with areas of brands similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the relaunch phase of its Boutique makeup product range so that most of the products are now vegan-friendly, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two Sainsbury's stores. The first did so last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day at small supermarkets has made large supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, the stores will increasingly resemble department stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight off discounted supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets to many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since acquiring both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to relaunch grocery sales and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's underwent a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended hastily in disagreement on how to divide the profits of the pharmacy chain within supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold its business of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury’s, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of skin products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, commented: “We have transformed the look of our beauty aisles in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help when offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and convenient location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and we challenge the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby backs out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "furious" after television host Holly Willoughby backed out of an 11-million-pound deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to dedicate himself to the Truly household products and accessories business.
The business of these two media characters had come to be compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones infuriated at retiring at the last minute from the lucrative lifestyle brand joint business to focus on his new own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to several sources, Jones was "furious" when the blonde television star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new agreements of the presenter, worth 1.5 million GBP, implied that he would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of household products and accessories Truly.
The business had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private jet to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source: "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was destined to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to back down left all the parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there is a warehouse full of merchandise at headquarters in Marlow ready to be sold.”
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had had an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president last March.
Both couples spend the holidays together. In addition, Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV’s I’m A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said: "We will not comment on your business."
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider “unpresidential” and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mocking the tone of a news anchor:
“I haven’t given up on anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told U.N. General Assembly leaders on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. to its first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump’s viewpoint, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: end of missile tests, help to free hostages and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded enclosure, we would have about 200,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds killed by tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet safe for foreigners to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute when offering aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not frequent on other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, although there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge number of islands in Indonesia is, at best, quite a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is now heading for Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces re-election next year laden with funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's ongoing sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 dead and tens of thousands displaced are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloodthirsty weapons.
Notice: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores the tie with a long shot against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with his 89th-minute goal at Stamford Bridge, London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal as his team was losing 1-0.
He accommodated the ball to the left before letting go of an incredible shot directed at the second stick.
The shot crossed the entire area with a large elevation as it was propelled towards the right crucible of the goal.
The ball finally started the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kanté was coming, I made a touch and I didn't think much about it, I just dedicated myself to kicking."
Chelsea won 1-0 at break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute through Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, Blue's forward returned a pass to Mateo Kovacic on the heel before starting from almost midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the midfield.
He then made a magnificent deep pass, which left Hazard within the area with the ball under control.
Hazard overcame the defense to finish second with a left leg shot that Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples in the group stage of the Champions League next Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped among the debris of the collapsed buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a press conference.
The city of Palu, of more than 380,000 inhabitants, was entirely covered by the debris of the destroyed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Finding Woman Stabbed
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with several stabbings at Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the residents of the area to have seen or heard something in connection with the crime to present themselves to the authorities.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "While the investigation is still at a preliminary stage, I would like to appeal to everyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the car’s in-vehicle camera, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body they found was from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, police have said they are reporting the incident to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has barely attempted to return to his flat, but police have informed him that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are being warned that it will be hours before they can re-enter.
He could hear a police officer explain to a man that the whole area is being treated as the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
He keeps saying, “It’s terrible!”
At 14:00, two police vans were inside the area cordoned off with another van parked outside.
A number of officers remained within the cordoned-off area controlling the apartment block.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 and mentioning file 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
Their disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the purest Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects of England perpetrated by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main targets.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor during the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure still believed by many to be worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than now, as an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a topic of historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, local sources said.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered in blood near a pig farm at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at a farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs to the market on Wednesday.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to an adjoining pig farm.
He said there was a large male pig in the yard with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kg lamb had fatally wounded the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were broken and full of blood,” said the cousin, surnamed “Wu,” as mentioned in Guiyang evening news.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig remained closed and isolated in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered the evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Despite being very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 300 kg caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to frighten the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are normally not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
“They like to play.
They are like children, they have a lot of curiosity... they do not go with the idea of hurting.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains will bring torrential rain across Southwestern U.S.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rain throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, similar to a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, eastern U.S. time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward toward the U.S. west coast. When the Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave strong tropical moisture northward toward the U.S. southwest.
The Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rainfall throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a chance that waterfalls will form, as the situation is deteriorating very rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms can bring gusts of wind and dust clouds at specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains in certain points of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation above 50 mm may be recorded, which could lead to smaller waste streams and slippery paths.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Isolated rain showers will begin arriving in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday.
The torrential rains will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
In October there will be several major temperature oscillations across the US as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The central U.S. region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
It is expected to start in October with heat in much of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures around 27 degrees from the southern Plains area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there is a high likelihood of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh’s statement
More than 20 million viewers on Thursday saw the passionate testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony was broadcast on six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters disrupting Friday's usual schedule due to a last-minute turn of events: a deal designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers were likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company averaged viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not immediately available for other broadcasters that broadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN, or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems calculating the people who see him from his office.
Put in perspective, this is an audience similar to that of an American football playoff game or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the highest-rated network, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the full-day testimonial, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS earned $3.1 million, NBC $2.94 million, MSNBC $2.89 million, and CNN $2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest remains high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was scolded by protesters as he attempted to climb an elevator to go to a hearing of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake stayed for several minutes with his eyesight shot down while he was filmed live on television on CNN.
“Here I am, in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They told him, ‘You have power, while there are so many women who do not have it!’
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, commented that he would have more to say in the committee's view.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcast networks were already broadcasting live the moment when the Committee on Judicial Affairs had to vote on whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary to submit it to a vote.
Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee ahead of next week, a condition demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was influential, as it was evident that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and of scorning national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, May’s former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that the UK and the EU collect each other’s taxes is “completely absurd”.
Wayde Sims Shooting Murder: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson for Death of LSU Team Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who served on the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene of the crime and claim they have found Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to killing Wayde with a gunshot, according to police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge district coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday, claiming the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Louisiana State Police Forensics Laboratory, Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that culminated in the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the area's law enforcement for their "diligence and seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "broken" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow".
“Things like this are the ones that make you suffer at all times,” Wade said.
A volcano spits ash in Mexico City
The ash spewed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was overseeing several rumblings and tremors that had occurred recently.
Images on social networks where a thin layer of ash is seen on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were detained in Barcelona last Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined opposing demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of pro-independence individuals detained by riot police began throwing eggs and powder paint at them, causing dark clouds of dust to appear on the streets normally overrun by tourists.
Later that day, there were beatings with the police, who used their clubs to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We do not forget, we do not forgive" face to face with Unionist protesters who shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not subsided in this independence-minded region a year after a referendum was held on October 1 that was considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by the Catalan separatists.
Voters elected independence by an overwhelming majority, although the turnout was low, as opponents of secession boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote entering polling stations throughout the region, which led to violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the chances of Catalonia achieving independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying for joy over being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, albeit by little margin, in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, given that many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or detained awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and says that the conflict has been fuelled by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is only increasing,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Presenting yourself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the setback in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after hitting a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone fired a crossbow at the car.
Menga wins Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston was a victory
Livingston, who had risen this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what is just the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 games as coach of the club in the neighborhood of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's move made the difference as, with this victory, Gary Holt's team climbed to second place, which they shared with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's team, on the other hand, continue without winning away from home in the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they are separated by a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, are extending their unbeaten streak to six games in the league, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what the loss is since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
The Livingston does not take advantage of their opportunities in front of the direct game of the visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead of the scoreboard long before the goal, as his direct play caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way between the defense, but wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the goal. Afterwards, Alan Lithgow sent the ball out as he stretched to try to finish Craig Halkett's header, which crossed the goal.
The locals were already good at letting the Rangers approach their area, as they knew they could put visitors in trouble in isolated plays.
And that’s how that decisive goal came about.
The referee whistled a foul against the Rangers' interests and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could touch it first and shoot from the center of the area.
Up until that point, the Rangers had dominated possession, but found themselves with an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game.
The scenario was repeated in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a merit stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman on one occasion and Lithgow deflected another Livingston combination move.
The Rangers devoted themselves to hanging balls over and over again in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for an alleged Halkett entry to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for hands. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man believes that they were excellent, and still exceed all expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top tier, although much of the merit has to be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of good heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be on the lookout for Menga throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the bright moments exhibited with Gerrard as coach, they have definitely not been able to maintain the level.
They did not know how to create occasions (only once they clearly overcame the local defense), and this the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, should be taken as a warning.
Sweet and bittersweet reception for Erdogan in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
The city has the world’s largest population outside of Turkey.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered in the vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard as they condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinion around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and called a dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies after colliding with a car
A cyclist has been killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics attended the cyclist, he died on the spot.
The crash comes months after another cyclist was killed in a runaway hit-and-run on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the crash site on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said their officers were working to identify the man and report the incident to close relatives.
The street has been cut and detours have been applied to the bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Riot
Six prison officers were wounded in an altercation at the high-security men's prison, according to the centre's office.
The incident took place at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still continues.
Specialized "tornado" agents moved to the scene to end the altercation, in which eight inmates have been implicated. The riot may have been contained on the one hand.
Officers had to be treated for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: “We have deployed specially trained prison staff to try to resolve an incident that occurred at Long Martin Prison, which still endures.
Six employees had to be treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to report to the police and may have to spend even more time in jail. "
The Long Lartin Penitentiary is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief had to be treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-riot agents were present in prison to solve a serious altercation in which staff of the center were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major flooding (dry areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen early next week when what is left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwestern desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The national weather service has already issued rainfall alerts for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and approach on Monday night with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have kept the tropical storm or depression state within a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was 64 km from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rainfall, with isolated spots where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Arizona Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could register from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the Rosa rain could become very good news, as the region suffers from a strong drought.
Although flooding is a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, as the southwestern region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, more than 40 percent of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa continued to have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with peak winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific, causing it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico could be heavy, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "75 to 150 mm of total rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north across tropical stormy Mexico, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and reach southern Utah well into the night on Tuesday.
“The main risk we expect from the Rosa or what remains of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
Rainfall is expected to cause dangerous flooding and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have made a call for anyone who may have some kind of recording of the facts with the mobile phone to get in touch.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the pettiness and anger' of Democrats
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rejection of the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said in an election in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the pettiness and anger” of the Democratic party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, bluntly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexually abusing her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at hearing in connection with his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that, on that day, "the American people saw the genius, the human quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable track record of serving citizens,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while discussing the importance of the turnout of Republican voters in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I didn’t run, but I actually did,” he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicating themselves to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place by Friday, an assistant to Republican party leaders told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, and many have been swept away by the giant waves hitting the beaches, as a severe earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters struck the coast towards sunset, dragging many of the people to their deaths and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and didn’t run right away. That’s why they became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it shattered everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
There are people who climbed a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency show the number of shops and buildings shattered, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The riots continued to rock this coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquake series were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographic characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “considerable” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped among the debris of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
According to Nugroho, the deaths and damage could increase along the coast some 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were totally paralyzed and therefore no information was coming" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse,” he said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officers said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording from a fan shared on social media, it can be heard as a man standing on the top floor of a building gives desperate shouts of warning to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water bursts by the sea, taking away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread power cut that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, the evacuees are still in desperate need of food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where the employees take shelter in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba says.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the heartbreaking gesture of starting relief work, some people complained that humanitarian workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, fundraising, provisions and staffing from abroad can only begin to flow if the site where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘Well, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start asking for international assistance, but that level has not yet been declared.”
As it fell on the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing people maintained the hope that the miracle would occur and their loved ones would evade the desolate account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child trapped in a gutter was rescued.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel circulated among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a grey check mark instead of a blue double check mark.
“I think that means the messages were not received,” he added.
Some thieves take away $26,750 during the filling of an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy said in the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "came running behind the Brink's clerk" and stole a purse of money for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "Being formally known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for a while now, and used the alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," according to the show's author.
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning to him.
“I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” West said earlier this year, as he spoke about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s you, it’s us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former collaborator of West, has used his nickname with or without script and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, when the country is about to mark the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that “military force would never again be used to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when leftist student student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds allocated to AI
“While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it spends on research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government announced measures on AI, despite a general lack of formal AI strategy in the country.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the world’s No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Duplicating the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the next breakthroughs in the field of AI,” said Lee.
“Duplicating funding could double the chances that the U.S. will achieve the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In 1980, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that outperformed the top-ranked American Othello player and subsequently served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee positively valued previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, “it’s not China that takes away the academic leaders; it’s the companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university eminences to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the U.S. work in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
“I think permanent residence cards should be automatically offered to AI doctoral students,” he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its state-of-the-art artificial intelligence development plan.
“The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China awards funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Sciences Foundation and other U.S. public bodies donate money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve industrial and academic collaborators, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently allocates more than USD 100 million a year to AI research.
In the meantime, no measure has been applied in relation to U.S. legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's accession requests to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raises questions about whether the minimum turnout needed for the referendum to be valid will be reached.
The question indicated on the referendum ballot is: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created as a result of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Election Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to the 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of the people registered voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” Gjose Tanevski, 62, said in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of tents installed by the people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not by the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will come with more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80 percent of citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said before dropping his ballot.
Zaev said a “yes” would be “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum necessary turnout.
According to the results of another poll, led by the Macedonian channel Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote “yes.”
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, scores a goal after bargaining all the defense of Brighton
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling overturned Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory at the match played at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) last Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a move that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He left by speed between three defenses of Brighton, sweeping what came out of him on the pitch.
Later, Agüero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He bargained for a defender before overtaking a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left that Sterling found.
The English forward returned the ball on the first touch, inside the area, to Agüero, who with his right leg beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that slipped into the net from the right side.
“Agüero has discomfort in his foot,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League fight.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball in depth on Brighton's field and
He made a beautiful pass into space on the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long pole.
The Sky Blues forward shot the ball inside the net before exiting through the bottom line.
City face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 18:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, no options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was little reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to go out on the pitching mound next Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold a lead game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have chances to play the play-offs.
The Rockies secured a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, at least we can get out there knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably play every point at the highest level, like no one has done this year.
“Why would I want to lose this game?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a launcher for Sunday, but they are apparently determined to let Scherzer throw if that happens.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a warm-up session on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday, his usual rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has an 18–7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones. I don’t present myself, but in reality I do. That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats is happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see their meanness, their bad intention.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control. But we won’t give them to them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is “to resist and obstruct.”
“And this can be seen in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, mean, dirty, and false.”
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which caused a strong public outcry.
“Remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Hey, hey, what?
Wait a minute... that was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party has ceased to be a different party.
He is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
“At the end of the day, I am the last in a series of British parliamentarians who have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she spoke out with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, they are similar issues with respect to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the notice of Friday's meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party it was communicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour parliamentarian, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of “more generous and kind” policies, if any, has long been forgotten.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision expected me to take a 180-degree turn and take positions I would never have taken, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social media is filled with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, denouncing the central policies and telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the messages I receive are usually political.
I’m impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who every day have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they don’t get screwed up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every “no confidence” motion or every change in the rules of selection, the party gets tighter.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and I have been advised to keep my head down, not to be so expressive and “everything would be fine”.
I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my student days, stimulated by Thatcher’s negligent government, which left my entire class literally crumbling, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt in any way about my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is walking towards a Brexit that will hurt homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of non-renewal of my candidacy or political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, for the benefit of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: some unbeaten Ayr lead the lead
Two last-minute rehearsals distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs deserved victory in this vibrant Tennant's Premiership day game.
The Ayrs, who are the only team beaten out of the ten, occupy the first position in the standings.
In the end, the local team established itself thanks to its defensive superiority and the fact that it knew how to take better advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
“The games we’ve played so far have put us to the test and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “Congratulations to the Ayrs, they’ve taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, yielded for the match by the Warriors, allowed the Melroses to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended the Ayr's lead with a penalty and, right in the middle, scored and converted a rehearsal to put the 17-5 score in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But the Melroses started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
Afterwards, the match was interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired on a stretcher, and in the resumption the Ayr widened the distance again with a rehearsal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Substitute Captain Blair Macpherson was then admonished with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of heavy pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw yellow card to make a tackle to Climo without a ball, from the penalty lineup, MacPherson scored a counter-trial behind the Ayr's penetrating mole.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since resumption, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to third-liner Gregor Henry to score the home team's fifth rehearsal.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the catering sector
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, appears to be on the verge of moving into the hospitality industry after he was found to have been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comic partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a source in The Scottish Sun said Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "flowing restaurant sector".
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia, landlocked, expects the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol through the naval headquarters covered in shearwater in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a navy blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
“Recovering it is a duty.”
Across the landlocked territory of Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a fierce resource conflict in the 19th century remains as vivid as is the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ resolution on big screens across the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will dictate in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign outlet to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, facing a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has high hopes for Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts think that it is unlikely that the Tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The U.N. body based in the Netherlands has no authority to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The ICJ resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favoured, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
“The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile,” he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally fast.
Next Monday Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crusader.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen unless it can trust US
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not eliminate nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come at a time when it appears that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a chimera to think that continued US sanctions and objection to a declaration ending the Korean War could make North Korea never kneel.
Washington is suspicious of accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament moves beforehand.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is taking seriously the issue of relinquishing an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of oversized hats, en route to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you do not need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented at the runway a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate dimensions from their SS19 collection, which dazzled the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been ravaged by very impractical hats, and this designers have brought their amazing creations to the catwalk.
The highlight of Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a wide, feather-shaped wing, which flooded the heads of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of quirky masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the brightly colored masks had stitched lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation resembled a complete scuba diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The oversized hats step on the heels of "The Bomb", a two-foot wide-winged straw hat that everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread through social media brought another great creation to the catwalk: a straw bag for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed in a swimsuit that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia ribbons and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’s La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Considering that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame if the demand for oversized accessories were ignored.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish Independent Schools maintain a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher studies, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest ratings in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages scored A higher.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as the subject of choice, are kept in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave for the cost of filling vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of which career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find an important job.
In Scotland there is diversity among schools in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are believed to be more important to the UK for the future, by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, you can always choose from a series of languages in independent schools, which have teaching staff specialized in this field.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In today’s global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered “international communicative competences”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait has practically ended for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play his first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play in a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump intends to win support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s rally in West Virginia can be viewed online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing begun this week with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was strained over allegations of sexual abuse he faces, while the Senate’s planned confirmation vote remains on hold for up to a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this wave of rallies is to help the Republicans who are running in the delicate November elections gain momentum.
President Trump’s five campaign rallies scheduled for next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, as we head into a busy campaign season,” a Trump spokesman said.
Tonight's rally, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could bring together sympathizers "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: the American team shows its ambition to keep the hopes alive in the face of the individual matches on Sunday
After three unequal sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The dynamic tipping pendulum is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on which side is the positive dynamic now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so I think we’re on a small positive streak,” Jordan Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be excited, largely because of Spieth's and Justin Thomas' fitness, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his lap and put a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the match in hole 15 with a similar cry, the kind that indicates he believes the American team is not yet out of competition.
“You have to work hard and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left of these players now.
18 holes to leave footprints.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed feeling of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to do a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogeys Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
Because of this result and the way in which its energy seems to flow to and from the bustling public, it is reaffirmed that it is the players who beat Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who partnered with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they never had any choice.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see for the interactions between pairings, the tips they give and the ones they don’t, and the way a strategy can change suddenly.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with a significant advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, had questioned.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable lead after finishing Saturday’s four-balls and foursomes with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a struggling Tiger Woods and leave his record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, headed by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago to Hazeltine, dominated a poorly matched American team in the morning fourballs and put the series 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to foursomes and won two games, but was unable to narrow the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed to the fourballs, they scored a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had crawled into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, re-teamed with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2–1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third respectively.
However, Europe didn’t have it all in mind on a pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans on Saturday by scoring two points.
They secured a decisive 2–1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later re-defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup had a team scored a four-point difference in individual matches, although Furyk's title-defender team only needs to draw to keep it.
However, after being second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack next Sunday is out of reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm 'in any way' if signs of confidence are not seen
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying its mistrust of the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not observe any response consistent with the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way.”
While Ri resumed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization approach for which North Korea would be rewarded as it gradually took action, his statements seemed significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization in full, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S. President-in-Office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to ease the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The United States insists that denuclearization must first occur and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the “declaration of an end to war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are intensifying our mistrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the side involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stalemate.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from what he held last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President “Mr. Evil” Trump dubbed Kim “Rocket Man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there is still much to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the application of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously pushed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying advances had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands".
At a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took “consistent action.”
He said Kim had communicated to him that the “consistent measures” he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the culture, increasingly widespread, of studying throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
One academic noted that students at the world’s number one university are often misled as to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you telling me now, all this, in my last year?'
He said no one had ever talked to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, implemented for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, which lasts one hour, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, bamboos and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects lack of sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, as one has a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in staying up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students make sleep deprivation an ever-increasing problem.
Making sure you enjoy good quality sleep for long enough should be a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students be mindful of setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home which is another outside stumbling block.
The Ibrox team was looking to add their first home win since last February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat to Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team adrift, 8 points from the Hearts, unstoppable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before halftime, and it never seemed as if the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equal the score.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, the Livingston climb to third place, behind the Hibernian by difference of goals.
And the Rangers could face further difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that apparently threw itself from the stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that swept the Ayrs in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same starting eleven who tore a point against the Hearts last week. Surely, he was satisfied with the way his well-organized team stifled its rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two-minute game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder kicked off and missed the big occasion.
A blunt foul by Keaghan Jacobs bumped into Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot to the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty kick at the 15-minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless stumbled, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only directed two shots on goal in the first half, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and docile forward Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi's first act in the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' hard-working move.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard acted in the pause to change Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change had a practically immediate impact, as the extreme made a pass to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran to the block.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the visitors' attention by playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band could have given direction to the final stages, but McGregor remained steadfast in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a deflected shot from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still asked for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually resulted in the device we know as the "Geiger counter".
The Geiger Counter, which has been a pillar of science ever since, also became a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, seemingly unsuccessful cowboy physicists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emanate from the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure it's bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.

New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ and Eliminate Malignant Cells
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can “see” a protein common to many cancers and then reinject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2), and subsequently re-injecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: “The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein “favors the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Berzofsky said.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West became involved in a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was screamed at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance congratulating U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run in the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“Whenever I talk to white people, they say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee for allegations of sexual assault brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated behind the scenes because of the hat he wore.
“They threatened me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
They harassed me.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" while saying that he would put on the Superman cape so they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love.”
His comments provoked the screams of the public at least twice and the members of the program's team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, which had a reporter there who explained to the publication: "The entire study was completely mute."
West was a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left much of the audience perplexed with the performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West obtained the support of the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING AFTER THE MULTITUD."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I have chosen not to reward someone (buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
And we too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "the one who was formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, was formerly named Snoop Lion and the defunct Prince music legend was renamed to a symbol and later the artist known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after the stabbing of a man on Friday in east Belfast.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast's court of first instance on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for playing the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of a manly hero, saying these roles imply that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and that he was questioning how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that she is very determined to face this problem.
“Personally, I’m now wondering where we’ve been wrong about masculinity,” she says.
“What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?”
According to Kit, television can bear some responsibility for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its manly characters.
He added: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel they should have this facet of virility?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
“Something has gone wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for next summer, saying he is fed up with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best he has ever provided Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life going forward,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spreading rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV from this cause has fallen to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health workers at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Considering the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions for sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican Party senators and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the lawsuits were prompted by critics and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Supposedly, the information published contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was posted by someone unknown to the Capitol during a Senate committee session on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and that it disclosed information from a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
“This unfounded complaint is completely false and a pure lie,” Waters said.
“My staff member, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this information leak.
This unfounded denunciation is completely false and a pure invention.”
Waters' statement prompted rapid online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of outrage,” Fleischer wrote.
"That makes me think he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
You don’t have to be challenging.
You don’t have to question the accuser’s motives.
You have to be calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces to such fraudulent statements.
“We will ensure that offenders are revealed, and that they will be held legally responsible for all actions they have taken that have harmed each and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again: Limited Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this reimagining of the action-comedy franchise of Johnny English, who was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-satire about how despicable we are will be a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the incompetent out-eyed and rubber-faced Johnny English has been able to renew his license for the second time to twist everything. His name indicates more than anything else that it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Obviously, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the inaugural ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious traveler Atkinson who represented the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, where he was sowing chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this last trip of JE.
I loved the Johnny English who approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the blades of the propeller resounded in the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is seen, but humor seems rather loose and oddly superfluous, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems intended for children rather than adults and, to me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the mute gags of the character Mr. Bean portrayed by Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the UK’s top-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the dismay of the service agent, an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and harassed figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character stepped on Teresa-May, but the script does not get any further.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as each active spy is put in danger, he will have to recover some retired.
And that includes the clumsy Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but giving unofficial classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his henchman sufferer Bough, a role he re-represents as Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of when things get very ugly in Her Majesty's secret service come into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "femme fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous madness: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French fast-food restaurant, they sow chaos smuggling aboard Volta's luxury yacht and English causes a great deal of confusion when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all seems like a children's program.
Pretty normal things.
As with the other Johnny English films, it has not been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and to cover five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week and will charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to spend the savings obtained with the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) on the workers giving them one more day of celebration.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit the party’s economic agenda and plans to tip the country in favor of the workers.
The change to a four-day labor week has the support of the trade union confederation Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits into the party’s perspective of balancing the economy in favor of the worker and the party’s general industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: “A four-day working week is not party politics and the party is not considering it.”
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week’s party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to utilities.
The shadow minister’s plans also imply that shareholders of water companies may not recover all of the investment, as the Labour government could apply “deductions” for crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector firm shares to employees, who expect to pocket annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains in "60 Minutes" whether Kavanaugh's FBI investigation could make them change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation of the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, raising questions about whether the agency’s findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
“I’m serious,” Kennedy said.
"I said at the hearing that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it all happened and the allegations were made public, and I asked him if he had done so.
He was firm, determined, and secure.”
But Graham's vote seems engraved on fire.
"I have my opinion of Brett Kavanaugh and would make an explosive indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it outright," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people I’m appointing will be able to verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything changing again.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, which presents an absolutely impressive program of stars, who carry out an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the event’s global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively help combat it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What achievements has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case of what we call “cliticism” (people who think it makes a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, which have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies comparable to more than $37 billion, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least US$10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the protected funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based association of investors and filmmakers, which is committed to “helping children grow as much as possible” and pledges to send Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the Q&As on their website that asked "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen replied, "It's going to be a long, hard road. Sometimes, we'll fall and fail.
But like the previous major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will feature Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a “blockade” to hamper Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington can, “if necessary,” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they are already doing in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
“The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for blockade, to prevent its energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively equal.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to harness and replace fuels,” he said, while pointing out that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said turned Berlin into a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost US$11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (FDI), has called on the US to step aside EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, director of the BDI (Federation of German Industries) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will “think carefully” about her candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “think carefully” about her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government fracture, for women to hold high positions,” he said.
“After November 6, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.”
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been candid in his criticisms of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "It's clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election."
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters believed he shouldn’t run by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “likely” voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed broader support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who were considered in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes the affected by PTSD Track Palin at the meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“With what my own son has been going on since he returned, I can understand other families suffering from PTSD ramifications and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers are returning with,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "They get a little different, they get hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district presented an amicus curiae on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who defied policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the lawsuit in the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the violent gang member's children" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where large numbers of asylum seekers are generated in the US, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
Federal laws require asylum claims to be adjudicated according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies entry of immigrants hurts the U.S. economy as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide needed jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in her June 11 announcement of this policy.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The atmosphere is very tense,” 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said as she reassured her son with a fever at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
“There is a lack of drinking water.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to grab flooded belongings and try to save as much as they can.
There are hundreds of injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside the Palu military hospital, as patients are treated outside due to repeated heavy shaking.
Tears shook his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
“I heard my wife crying for help and then I didn’t hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of harassment with "propaganda ads".
A week after an official Chinese publication ran a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China Daily’s paid supplement on Wednesday to The Des Moines Register, Iowa’s top-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. Congressional election, an accusation China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s campaign to step up pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to insert ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a intensifying trade war that has seen tariffs on mutual imports rise.
China’s revenge tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claimed that Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is redoubling harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press by inserting a paid advertisement into The Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the kiosk down here in Beijing, you will find few disagreeing voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that Chinese citizens may have on China’s worrisome economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was dodging the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans shun women voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault lawsuits, analysts have warned they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can’t be undone,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants shouted "November is coming!" as they marched in the Senate lobby as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be off the chart,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they’ve already been tall; it’s true.
But they could have been more, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who often don’t vote until they like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, detailing his sexual assault lawsuits against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a negative response could occur if Republicans pushed for confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench. It’s also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they have treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's wake and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the scales shifting slightly to the last.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony in an undoubted or probable way, while 35 percent say they believe in Kavanaugh’s testimony in an undoubted or probable way.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or undoubtedly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed the same from Ford.
After Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating lawsuits filed by Ford and at least another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted him under the influence of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Create a New Internet to Compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project in the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "take over the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the emerging company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They’re all available in one browser at the same time.
What is exclusive to the online storage of personal data is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, is that the company integrates adequate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some in-house developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that no one on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether we need to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely emptied overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a Saturday publication in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the Victory Cross of the I GM
The only clergyman in the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandchildren uncovered a memorial tombstone at a parade Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone came exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns".
Later he ran towards the line of fire and, with "maximum courage", advanced the line before jumping on a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment stunned.
The lieutenant colonel was shot dead by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never match, which produces a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who went without sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 and being denied the most important event.
The San Jose poster contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and was to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, viewers in the UK were stunned when the schedule changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted to have spent the night up until the morning to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the switch to cartoons as "a kind of vomiting joke".
“Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they switched to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But there it’s six in the morning on a Sunday and we won’t be able to resolve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We tried to show it again for the followers, but it was over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to other people because of his sexuality, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father had left him unimportant in winning the Olympic Games.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" the others because "it was not as socially acceptable as boys and girls".
“To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when his sexuality was discovered.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013, "took me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you go through so much when you are young (he participated in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple were parents in June to a boy they named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "his whole perspective" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold,” he said.
“There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
Her son is named after her father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t say, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the front row,’” he said.
“While I held his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that was what I'd dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in an Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small's Proud), which he had listened to during preparation for the Olympics and which still gave him the goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worsened Mickelson showed up for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he will have to change his physical condition if he doesn't want to become an unhappy goal.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourballs" and "foursomes" modalities.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments divides his time between being an entertainer and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough tends to punish the deviated blows.
And if his own trajectory is not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face the precise British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual matches, start strong, Mickelson’s match could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
“He understood his role perfectly for that day, he patted me on the back and wrapped his arm around me as he told me he would be ready for the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how I trained and that’s how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
It may mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that has not matched his individual record.
Mickelson has scored 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has contributed intangibles to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, joking, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great partner for the team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were having fun with him this week too, which has been fun to watch.
It brings a lot more to his game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advantage may soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a hard day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 at Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the American team, but in the end they managed to win by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by little," said Bjorn, after seeing the 2018 team win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
“History has taught me and all the members of the team that it’s not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go to the machine.
You have to get out and do everything right.
This does not end until the points go up on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
As I said, I focus on the 12 players that we have in the team, but I also have in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world.
Delighted with the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performance will make the difference and change everything.
It’s great to be with a partner when everything goes well, but individual duels put your golfing skills to the test.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to come out and get the best out of himself as well.”
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the last day's climbs, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he responded to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start well, as we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and in the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to start the comeback against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this order because I think it covers all the possibilities," Bjorn said of his selection for the individual clashes.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace former Cold War-era warships, but it will not do so until at least next year due to faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have set the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technology against stealth actions, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other highlights include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continued delays mean that the vanguard ships, which were expected to project into Germany as a powerful force overseas, will be obsolete when they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was already in the news last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder once it had been delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons why it has been returned, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it useless if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are significant, as approximately 120 sailors, half the crew required for the former Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Aside from the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also beginning to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, given the recent warnings that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used".
The officer said the situation has worsened over time because old ships were no longer used, but no new ones were provided as a replacement.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
A new research carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
The findings are expected to provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common bats, as well as northern ear bats and water bats at the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located at Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations on the property to keep track of bat activities during the season.
Volunteers and staff from the UK’s National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
Sound analysis of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Construction and restoration of buildings threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do fly paper and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo localization technique to locate insects and obstacles that stand in their way.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts with the proper training, who carry out surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues on a regular basis.
The organization has even created Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, claims that it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here at Threave, we have a great area for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a whole lot of good habitat.
But we are still unaware of many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
It highlights the importance of checking bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, harass and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
“We still have a lot to learn from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data on their population.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said the rape charges against him are "fake news" and that people "want to become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the allegations.
The Portuguese striker and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 at the time for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, the 33-year-old Ronaldo claimed they were “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," says the five-time Golden Ball winner on camera.
“They want to become famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it’s part of my job.
I’m a happy man and everything is in order,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have called "inadmissible information of suspicion about private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed in the Clark County District Courthouse.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him that he was a "99% good boy", except for a "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sex, but they were consented to.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed in the hospital, but later accepted a settlement outside the courts because she was "fearful of reprisals" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to annul the agreement, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he has signed for Juve, the Italian giant, in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would always regret' losing car manufacturers
The UK would “always regret it” if it lost its status as a world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal by the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade will work with the rest of the EU countries has aroused the fears of other UK automakers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is made on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for car manufacturing.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on March 29, there may be riots at the border, which the sector believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production should be stopped as a result.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
“We have to come to an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“Tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would stop, but in the long run, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, said members are beginning to be very concerned about the situation: “By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
White House says Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be delayed
Donald Trump’s long-awaited meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for a week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, in White House remarks Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, links between Russia and aid to Trump, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general and puts Mueller’s independence at risk has fueled rumours in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record the conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump has said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that Kavanaugh testified to and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI’s allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the entire Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she responded: "A date has not yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be a week later for all matters with the supreme court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists may refute this claim: Sanders has not held any White House briefings since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of briefings was not because he did not like the bragging of television journalists, although he said, "I will not deny that they are bragging."
He then suggested that there would be increased direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president does more question and answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, before adding the following without citing any source: “We have consulted this data.”
Sanders said the briefings would continue to take place, but "if the press has a chance to ask directly the President of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen us do it a lot in recent weeks, and they will replace the briefings when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on an official visit.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal and at times odd appearance in front of assembled journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to the EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service in the wake of fears about Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wishes them to continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of applications for residency status for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and everything seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that these are turbulent times for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Companions in the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting the patients and communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers relay Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed said the injury occurred shortly before midnight.
“It came to the sideline and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him on a stretcher and taking him away for further testing.
A Tennessee State official has informed Chris Harris of the WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after signing from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 that season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the Conservative Party’s new plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp tax will be levied on those people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK and that money will be used to help homeless people, a move that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will be levied on those individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will go to government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in second homes and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are from non-British residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to make their way to the property scale.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the big constructs of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to void affordable home quotas to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a number of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as rental controls and the termination of “no-fault” evictions.
It also wants to give more power to the city councils to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the unworthiness of homeless people makes everything even more real.”
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish has accepted the challenge of reviving the club from the northeast, which currently occupies the third position in League One, three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was summoned once as a support and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound program.
“But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland play at Hampden with my dad when I was little and it’s always something that makes me go back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in coaching clubs, but.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn't feel the pressure to be next on a list of established names on such a large team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my criterion for measuring my success will be whether I can return this team to the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its place is the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would only consider that I’ve been successful here if I can get the club back.”
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a period as second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third category and transformed St Mirren from battling for salvation into Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a decisive moment,” he recalled about accepting the position at Alloa.
“I always thought that training was the best thing I could do, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it well, I did it reasonably well and I enjoyed quite a few great moments.
Playing can be very hard.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I still go through things like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the most comfortable time I’ve felt since I’m an adult.”

The summer heatwave has spurred consumption in troubled bars in Britain, but added more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants fell by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA Financial Advisory, the company that collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has lengthened more than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to that of June, with the increase of 2.8% still in bars, except in restaurants.
The 1.8% reduction in restaurant consumption in June worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by the consumption of beverages, have obtained the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
People just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM’s leisure and hospitality analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors related to sales of the external leisure market.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales would be especially damaging, rather than the continued cost pressure.
This long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food shops and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide that much-needed breath.
The total increase in bar and restaurant sales, including those recently opened, was 2.7% in July, indicating a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sector sales indicator for restaurants, bars and taverns in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 million and is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that are hidden from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that are hidden from parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey among 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in "fake Insta" pages
News has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show to parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students indicated a rapid increase in “fake Insta” accounts, a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a clean “main” account that they show to their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Private Schools (HMC) of Independent Schools, revealed that 40% of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, of which half have admitted that they have private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the directive of the Scottish athletics federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish athletics federation at the organization's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most medal-winning field and track athlete and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I look forward to growing the sport and contributing to it in Scotland.”
The American, who won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what degree.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and today it's time to do agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
An ad comparing mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A company has divided opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers with cows that are milking.
To mark the launch of what is considered the “world’s first silent slingshot that can be worn,” consumer technology company Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a music video prank to show the freedom the new slingshot gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of fodder and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I wrinkle myself, but you won't see a tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed, they're not pantyhose, they're my breasts."
"Bomb, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk the girls."
However, the announcement, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from viewers, many of whom claim it shows the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are taken away from their babies a few days after giving birth,” one person wrote.

Another person commented: “Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a slingshot for mothers who will keep their babies?”
Another user added: "It's an out-of-place ad."
Others defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song to be "fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Shooting for the slingshot made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but it has to be taken for what it is.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a funny ad for mothers who pump with slingshots (usually at their workplace or in the toilet and feel like they're cows.
It’s not an announcement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the strap discreetly stuck in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use the slingshot.
However, the Elvie strap is completely silent, has no cable or tube and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women more freedom to move, hold babies, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood developer at Mother, said: “The Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
In drawing the parallel between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a slingshot is used and the challenges involved, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new slingshot.
This is not the first time that Elvis has made the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though monthly cross-border entries have remained virtually stable, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid to put their ability to stay in the country at risk if they decided to take in a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to host unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80 percent of people who have hosted or live in the home of a person who has hosted are in the country illegally, and a vast majority of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we will continue to prosecute these people,” Albence said.
To prosecute children faster, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of being held, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than face-to-face, to defend their case to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for aid will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent cramps or attempts to flee, according to workers and reports that the system has released in recent months.
Lawyers say these concerns can intensify in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
They have added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country that has lasted for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have purged all Syrian territory” from both terrorist groups and from “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said the conditions were good for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears" that make the refugees want to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats have said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone at the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has given the opportunity to continue political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with Russian help in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed hope that military action will face jihadists, which include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a U.N. envoy, hopes to convene early meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and opposition to begin shaping a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the election again in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, scandals and the impeachment process end his presidency prematurely.
What would undoubtedly be "the end of a most dramatic presidency in history".
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers at peak viewing times has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and practically tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak viewing times, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“People have been blown away because they don’t understand it,” said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet decree that happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
“He said it because it made him laugh,” Scovell said.
There is an entertainment point in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go further when you find yourself at the sixth hour to watch a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of “private-use” sources for his book “Fear,” the 15,000-dollar ostrich leather jacket by Paul Manafort (“a thick garment like the pride of” and “the headline of” that was made by Mr. Trump’s “Fear”).
I will never see Super Mario again.
“Part of what makes it seem like it’s part of a reality show is that every night gives you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the character changes and script turns of Trump’s show (fighting with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because you're left behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and it was sunny outside the house he has on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing those clumsy programs back then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it would be a joke, but it looks like they were right.”

Foreign money floods the races for the tighter midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a flood of cash in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has caused two current members to compete for the same spot.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburgh involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which comes into conflict with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decreed in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the parties’ main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a long-running special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
US imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, but withdraws them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions about not recognizing Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador was contemplated, which received in 2017 US aid of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death toll from murder and unemployment.
Following the internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made clear they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending any likelihood of sanction for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to their positions in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman in Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, who included two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations since anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also since anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Study History
The next event to occur could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is numerous evidence in public records.
As far as is known, Mueller is also investigating whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the body, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
They are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European namesakes, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over points of inflection like this, and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The United States is currently facing several turning points.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with water in his neck since that newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Rosenstein claims that the Times information is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witnessing?
And, especially, will we vote in the middle of the legislature for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will begin to be in danger.
But I don’t think we will fail, because I have already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador’s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With that baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic for the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw on the field of Villarreal this month, would leave them in a good position to qualify for the group of G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have taken something more in the end, but in general, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
We hope to be able to keep the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they took a good result in the last game, but I am sure we will give everything and achieve a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The team is good and the guys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it our all, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women Lose Sleep Because of Fear of Retirement Savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to their family about it.
Approximately half of respondents nationwide say they have talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents say they have talked to their children about it.
“People want some family member to take care of them, but they don’t dare to think about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
We have to start here.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover expenses, or your own insurance with your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the way to legal battles.
Look for a representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals meet your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also consider hiring a notary for your finances.
It is advisable to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid in case of incapacity.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"Finance is not the only factor that needs to be determined, but also which doctors you want to treat," Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Keep this plan in place.”
Man shot several times with a compressed air shotgun at Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times by a compressed air shotgun while returning home after going out at night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which took place at around 2.30 a.m. (in British summer time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His life is not in danger from the injuries and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died due to a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
As communications are cut off, relief units have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Below are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency extending along more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region less than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the Central Celebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast at the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami struck west of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt and earthquakes often occur there.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
On December 26, 2004, a major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006 – A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that smashed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 shook a pop area of the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the islands of Mentawai, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died from the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the tourist Indonesian island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and resistance to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she pulled out her phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su interim detention center, where he is held under an unsecured bond of $500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he pleaded “not guilty, for sure” when asked how he pleaded, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A fouls, meaning he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His wife said he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek exceptional death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary sentence that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and that he “intentionally” caused serious personal injuries, according to the intent notice to seek the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both offenses could result in a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with a 22-fault indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they told investigators that they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also requested that the ISIS flag be unfurled in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's troops" today during a protest at the Conservative party conference.
The former UKIP leader has said politicians should “feel the pressure from Eurosceptics” when one of Theresa May’s own MPs has suggested she should lead negotiations with the EU.
Unofficial Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when pro-union conservatives have come forward in another anti-Brexit protest in La City.
The prime minister is struggling to preserve her Chequers compromise plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, the supporters of the union and the EU.
The allies insist that he will manage to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the Conservative party to choose between his package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told Solihull's Leave Means Leave rally that he wanted to undo Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we’d be out,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to undo Chequers’ commitment.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be slavish.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is totally false."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters, "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, to listen to the people."
“Chequers’ commitment is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the streets and get us to win an election.
Abandon the commitment of Chequers and begin to listen."
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that the politicians of the rally must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t allow it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the political class, on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.”
“We are mobilizing the people’s troops of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners over the Conservatives against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with a party application at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for the frictionless border, for borderless free trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been a center of speculation about the possibility of releasing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the open-meeting format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it’s time for “women to go to Washington to fix our government that doesn’t work, and that includes a woman at the top.”
A person arrested for the shooting of Sims, from the LSU
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the 11:00 ET news conference.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head that eventually killed him,” police officer Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Police Department.
Sims, a 2m junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts during last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after team orders hand him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have an important role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton while defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel pitted earlier and let Hamilton run with the traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to pit and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the free interior with the risk of being left out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap was in seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position for much of the race as he retained his wheels to save time, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and moving into fourth position.
He finally entered the pits on lap 44, but could not increase the pace on the next eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It’s a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a fantastic job to have a U-two,” Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday to insist that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that people are "bad, cruel and lying."
“Something that could happen and the most beautiful of what’s going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry, mean, cruel and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they say, ‘No, it wasn’t me.
It wasn’t me.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... Did you leak the document? "Eh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t leak it.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... No, we didn’t leak it,” she added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s statements, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me to."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the Saturday night rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over for power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite defeat against the Belfast Giants, as they won the 5–3 back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two-goal lead thanks to the close-ups of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised their team's level, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for the Dundee. Then, two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had just won Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from the hand of Dwyer in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assist by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this hectic early period, Sullivan repositioned the home team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first break when he scored the night's second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the match at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after dying to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake shook the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many aftershocks are occurring in the area and there are many people trapped among the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his companions escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place at the shaky control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in place to ensure that flight Batik 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take flight.
He then left the air traffic control tower when he thought it was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia representative Yohannes Sirait said the move could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“It broke my heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are bringing aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All mini-markets have been looted.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working against the clock to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he said on CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated a flight that was going to crash in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man has gone missing, although they previously said the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they had not found a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that all were in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon because the runway was short.
Witnesses believe that the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
“That was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to walk with water around their waist until the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working closely to upgrade a dock also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered on PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
Analyst writes a chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded the case on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to build the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said she received location data from different mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted her earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed to be in Sanford's pickup truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, as his pickup truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers's text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to pass into the hands of the jury during the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
Bristol's The High Breed claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and put hip-hop consciously back in fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couple for dismissal after ‘racist’ message
A New York nanny has reported a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from her mother protesting that she was "another black person."
The couple denied that they were racist and compared the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed dismay when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO Another Black Person,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her pity, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the nanny she had fired, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her day’s work and then sent home with an Uber.
Maurice now claims compensation from the couple for the dismissal and asks for compensation of approximately US$350 a day for the six-month residency work for which she had been hired, even though there was no contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t do things like that,” he told the Post on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have responded to statements that they are racist by saying that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they could not trust her after having offended her.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t want to say.
He's not racist.
We’re not racist people,” Joel Plasco, the husband, told The Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to "extortion," said his wife had two months to have a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you going to do something like that?
It’s not a very nice attitude,” added the investor banker.
The legal case is not yet resolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and to condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared readers might not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to take the place of someone reading it for the first time before it's published.
It’s very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before having the inspiration to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "sweet bittersweet", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and adds that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
“He was a discreet man; he wasn’t a presumptuous one,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was pretty much like when your son gets something: you’re proud, even if it’s not your thing.
I think that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always used to acknowledge Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
Upon landing, they rushed their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nothing called frequently to say that it was very serious and that they didn’t expect me to get over it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad and she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medicines he had been given for his body to keep beating were being consumed and coming out of his system.
He had died earlier than planned and so everything was shut down.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep good shape.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience that was going on.
“No one knew,” he said.
“My head was high and my tears kept falling.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I loved her very much.”
Grieving women hanging cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, killed himself.
“I don’t want any father or mother to feel what I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, residing in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile could illuminate any room.”
However, he left his job before dying because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis stated, "I am continually concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people you can turn to, who can listen to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
“He never said he wasn’t feeling well or that he was depressed or anything like that,” he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we saw a change of attitude.
He touched the bottom on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts and he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
He said that his death would be a great trauma for them, but that they have to work on it: "It opens a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we have to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a scope and a limited time), we could get some unity," Mr. Flake said Saturday. He also added that he feared the committee would be destroyed with the root deadlock of supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
Only five weeks until the November 6 midterm elections. If, as expected, the Republicans do not get good results, they will see weaknesses in getting the man they want elected to get to the main court of the country.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to undo the tie and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors "cau" with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tight border controls between North Korea and China and rising prices charged to human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Normally, the vast majority of North Korean defectors are offered the nationality of South Korea.
Seoul sources say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers migrant defectors illegal, rather than refugees, and often repatriates them forcibly.
North-South relations, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed broadly to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally,” Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysteric" and not fit to work in the High Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysteric" and that his temperament makes him unable to work on the High Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted this way, she would have been called a ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said in connection with her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and speechless as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the allegations against him amounted to a "grotesque and coordinated murder of a character" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not work in the High Court, as it showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if it is confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“That’s what I can say: if you don’t tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, you’re not only not fit to be in the High Court, you’re not fit to be in the court where you are right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge in the Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she considers herself a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the High Court.
“It is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and hope that it will seem wonderful to us,” Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It is a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and he cannot take it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. And you?"
She went on to say, “I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and she started crying, telling the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then he continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for rabies in part because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a male majority, where I once ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of an older woman (a cold directive who had always scared me a little) who grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they’ll have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado Democrat, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me as he laughed 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it "White and the Seven Dwarfs"
As he arrived late in the campaign, he was late with fundraising, so he promised that he would not enter the race if he did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give $250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and for orienting herself to voters, rather than delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she was left speechless.
“You could have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled of the press reaction.
“You could have thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what will they put in my tomb?
"You're gonna cry?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The initial salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the war does not appear to end soon, a distancing of the countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed taxes on major Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting USD 200 billion worth of goods. These tariffs entail a taxation on half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has counter-attacked each time in the same way and recently raised tariffs from five percent to ten percent for $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to replicate the US and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to back down anytime soon.
Making Washington backwards involves yielding to some demands, but publicly bowing to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that initiate a fall in either of these countries is far more dangerous than witnesses had predicted,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a panel of experts.
Syria is 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
“Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All conditions are met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country and in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that financed the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European national team has achieved the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US national team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team again won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the start into the water in hole 3 16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his series and became one of four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out with a 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European national team Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 race points.
“I don’t cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so glad I got the cup back.
The team is the most important... and I am happy that I was able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the relay to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a solo competition on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games he had in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players ever, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. national team struggled all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-end golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of these players, they’ve fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pressured the European selection.
We fought.
I'll take off my hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and am proud to have been their captain.
He has to take off his hat.
They defeated us.”
