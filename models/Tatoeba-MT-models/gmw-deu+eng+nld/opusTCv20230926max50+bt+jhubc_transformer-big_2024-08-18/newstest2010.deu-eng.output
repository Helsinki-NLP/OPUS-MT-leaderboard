Barack Obama Receives Nobel Peace Prize as Fourth President of the United States
U.S. President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to win the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Nordic metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time ever with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony, in which Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He is the fourth President of the United States, but only the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already said that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan War when he takes over the prize.
The president does not want to dodge this issue because he knows he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and check over ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific charitable work.
The event programme then includes a banquet with the President and his wife, where, in addition to Norway’s King and Queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will also be present.
Obama has been very cautious about the price from the beginning.
For example, he stated that he felt that he did not quite deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that it is not just the price for him, but for all those who seek the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this was for him "invitation to action".
Conservatives accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for blackmail.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors in his favor, said the head of police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaft is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in prison and is facing up to three years in prison.
The sorting waste containers in Brno do not smell well
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find the sorting waste containers again on foot.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage cans.
I do not want to claim that the separation of waste in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors are insufficiently concerned about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of PET bottles in a collecting basket?
This is art, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the Moravian Place opposite the affected goose.
Mr Onderka should not annoy us by his colleagues, but that seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is also not a honey lick in other parts.
A lot of my friends prefer not to sort the waste.
Out of laziness.
It is too far to the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on the Konicova street I didn’t see any trash cans in sight.
Luckily, I got to the right place when driving the tram.
The garbage almost ran over.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
You prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic, instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner burn.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after searching on the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst place in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party, despite the government’s view, gave farmers and officials more money, there is no longer any money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and construction savings.
But also not for the state debt rates or for the international court disputes.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in the government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists imposed the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money additionally for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or sickness benefits.
Of the loans, more and more higher interest is paid, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the state treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state operation are not reduced, the tax shall be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on for their children.
For the pensions or sickness benefits, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared, people need not be afraid, they get that money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise faster and faster, along with the costs and interest.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer suffice to raise VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-ficial package.
Because of the money turnover in favor of some electoral groups, next year there will also be a shortage of five billion for the expansion of highways and railways.
These are predominantly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly discounted.
At the very most, which is not free.
This means delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, the European money creation is also at risk, warns the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has suggested that it solves the outflow of money in a salomonic manner – it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, where the state owns the majority, and from which the money is then distributed to the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion CEZ went into the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay off the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, according to EU rules, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, the carnival of the upheavals has not yet ended.
Nearly three billion cut the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, or for expenses for litigation, even construction savings.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court case, then we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already started two-billion-dollar project "State Fund", which is to allow to monitor on-line what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will have two operating systems
Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and Windows Mobile will switch to Android within a few seconds.
It is precisely this opportunity that the American company wants to introduce VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We enable you to run two user profiles on your mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware pointed out during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware already successfully presented the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, on which at the same time the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now the company VMware is working together with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and to the customer the devices should come within the year 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Snowless slopes worry not only the Giant Mountains residents.
The lack of snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That’s why you can still get free rooms in the Giant Mountains for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but by now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, said.
Anyone who wants to spend New Year’s Eve in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer saving and where the quality of the stay comes in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The spindle mill hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year’s Day.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they too have to give in, and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, Jandura appreciated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year’s Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest for winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and slightly better than last year, the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou can be occupied.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year’s Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also staffed by the central car park in Janske Lazne for 80 percent of the New Year’s Eve stays.
On the other hand, at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, half of the beds remain free for Christmas.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by January, for which we are currently about 60 percent occupied.
February is a bit weaker now, but the moment the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said Erik Sporysch, director of the Hotel Omnia.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow cover.
On Thursday it should cool down and in case of rainfall it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, a warming is to come again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It’s almost funny with what student aspiration Barack Obama, the president with his reputation as the smartest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy in the Afghanistan issue, which he himself thought was the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off via the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Path" without faltering.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea of sending fresh troop contingents to Iraq plagued by the civil war as an “irresponsible and, in its conclusions, catastrophic decision.”
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and in this respect very successful one to stop talking about Iraq in the news today.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting position than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
He was once again asked by the military to increase the contingent of troops, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even in spite of the subordination habits, strongly criticized the faltering shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he cheated the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
Most problematic of the entire Obama strategy is his intention to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves behind more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the increase in half will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the fraternal war of recent years, Iraq society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication - no one can be trusted and no agreements are made.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only fake buildings behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the confusing circumstances that complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences even more.
The building of a "actable state" which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama strategy obscured by his volunteerism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now on the brink of an explosion.
Believing that the little soldiers who broke out in the cries of war about the "early homecoming" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is negligible.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Kush mountain foreland.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iranians do not work, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question needs to be answered in the period when America is stepping up to Obama for the winning withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time for him to resort to a different strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs’ managers no longer receive bonuses in cash
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This was announced by the company, which is responding to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of the money, but they can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the event that they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street’s premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the wider direction it has to go in, led by JPMorgan’s former banker, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after she set aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the total amount of bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure reported today.
The high bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the beginning of the financial crisis.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers’ bonuses, which exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000, once with a 50 percent tax.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record-breaking women today took over this year’s Nobel Prizes in the subject categories and literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf in Stockholm.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, and their compatriot Jack Szostak, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for chromoson research.
Israeli chemist Ada Jonath, along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, has been awarded the Prize for Chemistry for enlightenment of ribosome structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was awarded to American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao for glass fiber research and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines or astronomical telescopes, have won this award.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of acquisition of the money prize.
It is 10 million Swedish kroner in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the cash price is divided among them.
Traditionally, US President Barak Obama received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his path, and is also at the top of the country that is leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policies, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the fight for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in the government because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form approved by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the themes of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis in public finances.
The meeting was informed by the president’s spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday about his further stay in his function.
Under the budget law, which Klaus now receives for signature, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
In Parliament, however, on Wednesday, the Left Party proposals on money turnover were voted on and the money for state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers increased.
The government has resisted the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute has arisen, which is why the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer official cabinet, on whose design the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party have agreed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures implemented by the Fischer government in the autumn, which, in their understanding, is intended to end the public debt.
Klaus, who can, but does not have to, sign the law on the state budget, explained today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem" that represents "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, said the budget is horrific, and the government should weigh its continued existence.
The ODS chairperson, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial staff as "strong statements".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrific that the former Topolanek government had prepared for this year, exceeding 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman.
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows much of the country's struggle and victories despite some criticism that the lead role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The relentless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, portrays the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman, in his life story.
Freeman said he was asked by ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing section "Million Dollar Baby" already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which in the end has become a slaveholder, a fictitious U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mande.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film portrays a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unify the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through the sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team ascends to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I have found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it will be transferred, and I felt that I know what you are feeling, he said.
It is important for me to become a different person.
Matt Damon portrays in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I ringed the doorbell that it opened and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his analysis in the following words: "That was very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the websites rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light Secret about Norway Dissolved: The Russians Have Tested a Rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was being tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was again unsuccessful and the rocket, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, called the type "Bulava", will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality and the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on the ground during the missile test also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, one already writes about "Bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but shines
This 13th attempt was normal in the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage to the rocket occur.
Probably the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time, "Bulava" launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not since the first moment doubted that it is a Russian missile.
This time, the generality has defended itself against this and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without error, the head of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fills the generality with optimism and so it is further claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defensive player Vjaceslav Fetisov once again introduces himself to a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow out in need, and probably already competes in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured himself, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
It is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, co-starred Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back on the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
At the age of fifty-one, legendary striker Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford in the NHL, earning 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and has also triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he twice hoisted the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit dress.
He has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime hours are canceled
The management of the Hyundai Nosovice car factory agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
Due to frequently ordered overtime, the union announced on Monday that it was ready to strike.
This was confirmed by the spokesperson for the Hyundai car factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, so voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, for the reason that two work shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive it in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change employee motivation for the proposed overtime hours.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
Taking into account that overtime was the most urgent and burning point in terms of demands and complaints from trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k noted.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work 2 overtime hours virtually every day after the eight-hour shift.
Once the agreement is signed, the willingness to strike will be revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike readiness.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automobile factory increased, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor terms of payment and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, maintained that the employees had to do overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
The trade unionists also demanded in their Monday strike readiness statement that employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday should not be subjected to sanctions.
In the area of overtime, the unions demand that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they demand the payment of 5000 crowns this year.
The Hyundai Nosovice automobile factory now employs 2,000 people.
The series production was started in the company in November last year.
By this September, around 80,000 vehicles had been produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in <0xCC><0x81>stealed <0xCC><0x81> HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not work as strongly on common virus variants as one of the already existing drugs.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, patients can prolong the drug composition and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus propagation also leads to the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which no more drugs are effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University of Prague) and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein that is responsible for proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus propagation in a different way than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new 'improved' compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and resistant virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV-protease-induced splitting of the HIV virus, no mature infectious virus particles would arise.
When we turn off HIV protease, we also turn off the propagation of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified further.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the test tube, including against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarboranes on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the case of clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formation, makes the metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS went off on fishermen who resisted
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "great" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It is supposed to be time for analysis.
Deputy ODS Chairman Petr Necas said the official cabinet concept with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to base himself on the minority in parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he intends to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament on Wednesday adopted the budget for 2010, however, with link party amendment proposals over more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has raised the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has refuted the proposals of the Social Democracy to covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic was to operate with a lag of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has fulfilled the wishes of the government, because even the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provision.
Disappointment and senselessness
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has cited that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation in the case that the amendments would be accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the negotiation of the budget.
To what extent Fischer voices his support for the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominees of Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The prime minister should also say clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions or the service law amendments.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS are not wrong
This is the cause of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function, people are sitting, professing to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to renounce the fight against the deficit height of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in parliament."
Then he is supposedly unable to count on the support and tolerance of the bourgeois democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that will be up to date, then I will deal with it, said Defence Minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the Democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon at the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the Prime Minister's request
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS would likely vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the MPs of the Citizen Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not appear as orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize my voice was missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevikization of Parliament and the destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will run for about the same fare.
The Czech Railways will terminate or limit some less-used fast and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. basic and customer fare are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area receive several connections to the capital, and the railway uses Pendolino-type trains for this route.
The express train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
There are also fewer express trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are generally reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the Hradec Kralove district (Kingsgraz), a total of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and to a few days a week, the operation of some express trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth transport route of the Esko suburban transport system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run within two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have not been able to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year’s bill for regional railways: 200 million more
The rapid trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, and the railways in total receive four billion crowns to pay for the so-called loss of liquidity in the coming year, just as they did this year. The local trains provide the districts with a total payment of eight billion crowns in the coming year, with the state firing three billion crowns.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the express trains, the railway has re-contracted a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps because of this it has not used the price increase on the vast majority of tickets.
Changes can only be made with one-day CD Net network tickets and with cheap eLiska internet tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 krona to 600 krona.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the travelled plug, until now it was uniform for travel between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine millitants arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitants kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was cited by the AFP agency, which initially informed only about 65 kidnappers.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the millitants belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police tracked the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge acts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was associated with the election to the governor’s office, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of taking part in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, however, the peace negotiations with the Philippine government resumed.
The story of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will be released in the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly selected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the cinema launch of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public will also be heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, then in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when, on the one hand, preparations for the World Cup culminate in South Africa, but at the same time the media shakes the world’s public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination against residents by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the main characters with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and prepared myself well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela several times in person, so that I can receive his energy, as they say, he performed in an interview after the film’s festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good to be able to get to know Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the rugby national team dress
The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, freely translated “In the Role of the Enemy”: Nelson Mandela and the game that unites the people portrays the South African advocate of human rights during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman strives throughout the film to bring together two race- and year-and-day-demarcated populations and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the World Cup field in his role in the South African National Rugby Dress, which then won South Africa.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, predominantly from the white audience, and has thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may be able to bring people together again to form a single people, led by rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve, that will only become apparent.
The white South Africans are skeptical, however, as revealed in a recent interview for LN the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskow in the Louny area.
In the fire, according to Usti nad Labem district fire department spokesman Lukas Marvan, six units invaded.
Originally, the fire department wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the security operation of the line system, according to the company spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage has been estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely, the damage will not be counted until after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, nothing like this has happened in the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the CEZ spokeswoman for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech region as the sole operator of the line system, the electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgear systems with 67 transformers, which transfer the electrical energy into distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura filed a criminal complaint against three CSSD leaders for slander.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today filed criminal charges for libel against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company's effort to operate regional train traffic in some districts.
However, all regions have ultimately signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, while we only made the offer about the extent to which it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railway, because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway, which were completed last week.
There is nothing left for us but to defend us.
Because of this defamation of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he argued that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of the criminal complaint to be a continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional railway traffic and uses lying and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million kroner in advertising, which will indicate the detrimental step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he wants to interrupt the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech Railways and had not tendered for the order in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he also threatened a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we don’t do without it, we can lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, Jancura told the Radiojournal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcal changes habits from January onwards.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But already now voices are reporting that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal culminate.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that the health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
As of January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci born on August 2 last year and later.
The condition is that they have not received a vaccine dose yet.
Anyone who has already started vaccination in the last year or earlier, must also pay for further revaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccine must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, the experts estimate that the health insurances for vaccine doses spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
However, they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children’s land vaccinations.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal causes middle ear infection, but also severe infections including brain skin inflammation and blood poisoning.
As a result of pneumococcal infections, up to 28 children up to 10 years old die in hospitals every year.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
That the compulsory vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, the head of the citizen association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to achieve at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal disease.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, chairman of the Society of Practical Pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
“In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination has been started as a voluntary one,” Cabrnochova says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcal from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococcal is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first area vaccination paid by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
“Insurers should spend the money on prevention so they can save for further treatment,” Cabrnochova said.
Doctors need to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is associated with a concern of practical pediatricians concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the state to them.
However, some MPs feared that the insurance companies could "export the money out of the health insurance."
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant amount.
This is not going to be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his vehicle with a trailer when he loaded 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used a excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father that "he should enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings to a warehouse".
The agency said that Frank Frazetta Senior denied having given any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
The ministers defended the tax increases and spending stops announced in the pre-etat report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "dispensed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by deferring the decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Treasury was also under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent cap on public payrolls for 2011.
Social Security Distress
The unions have protested against the fact that low-wage recipients are being punished for a recession they have not caused and warned of imminent “problems.”
The increase in social security — to about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year — has upset the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
SUBJECTS OF THE VORAB ETATE REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% as of April 2011
This year, the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax breaks for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year, and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 per year will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person with <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 will be richer by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult decisions," but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would account for the 5% of the top earners.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending stops would be “a drop on the hot stone” compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers, they will bring us the deficit halving, and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s forecasts of future economic growth – affecting the scale of new debt and the speed of deficit mitigation – were questioned after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year – far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while the debt would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Missing Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion debt over the next six years is untenable.
They added that the ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and "cynically" push themselves before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything important about what they were going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond, "they had their opportunity to do so, and they let them pass by."
"The significant announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are protected from future cuts, unlike in the Conservatives’ proposals, which see the deficit cap coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money won by the tax increases and spending stops is being used to cover next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalidity pensions next April – the Chancellor of the Treasury would be exposed to the charge of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra help when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although the ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come into effect in the medium term.
The recognized Institute of Tax Investigations said the Chancellor’s figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the areas of transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“It only shifts the pain to later,” said his leader, Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," Roger Bootle, an economics consultant at the auditing firm Deloitte, said in a statement.
"This was just the hollow preliminary budget report. Markets recognize that."
FBI investigates “detentions of US citizens in Pakistan”
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens for suspecting extremist ties in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Panjab, the American embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges they are charged with and under what circumstances they are being held," Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it is actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had already taken an interest in the house before and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that it refused Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. must work “more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradicating the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns 'abuses' in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, the issue of human rights in Iran is still as bad as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Teheran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak penitentiary.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari’s report saying he was charged with “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty said.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former detainee who said he and 75 others had been detained in a container at a detention center in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty International acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and government reactions to it, but Amnesty International stated that the mandates and powers of these bodies would be unclear and that the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said at least 90 people have been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competitive piste.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that glitters below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best feats or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still you and me
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a construction ban on minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated — and integrated — into one of Europe’s most declared secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argued study of a dispute that divided and occupied the country for over a decade and a half, and whose effects can still be perceived today.
Bowen’s latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France what Bowen calls “Islamic freedom.”
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students about the issues that worry them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane affairs, he claims, that make up daily life, quite in contrast to the political dramas that the media employs.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arabic-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society.
They don’t have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite so passionately guarding the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews who, in turn, had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a “strengthening of the value screws” rather than a growing pragmatism.
After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The world's most desolate view
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts at alarming speed and takes with it life that can’t survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fisheries interests have recently entered the open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keelwater.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Wandering in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proven themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old sailor to the sea, who fought only with his musket’s rifle flask, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoo plants typically still have a millionth of the habitat of a wild old animal, and the climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became completely green from the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sled-driving Inuit use powerful assault rifles to take their prey to the ground.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will last the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
However, this is not due to a lack of attempts at explanation.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time indicated the whirling of the ice pack.
Submarines so much in the Cold War the shifting ridges when undercruising.
A useful addition are satellite surveys and the large-scale deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a glimpse into the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater rinses compressed upon freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, all are at risk once the summer ice passes, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, that could be me.”
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington.
De'Angelo Robinson traveled by bus for seven hours to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval infantrymen who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they followed.
“In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in various cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which also extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at the Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York, and at the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband isn’t buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who sacrificed.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It is like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the First and Second World War and the Vietnam War as their target, since they are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing and couples were holding hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the greying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bow attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends clung to each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white place cards that had been placed in the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son’s grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infringement Subofficer David Shane Spicer, who fell into battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ... my son paid for it, she said.
“If I’ve been gone for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as USAID, the U.S. Department of International Development and the World Bank.
U.S. Interest Representation Consular Officers in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of "threat."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community headed by popular reporter Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro Brother’s communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy attaches importance to the fact that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as release of political prisoners and creating more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokeswoman for the U.S. Interest Representation in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the issuance of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently released a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba", a reference to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the leader of the country who replaced the sick brother.
Vivanco said the defendants were very often arrested, convicted and detained within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, precisely at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday an allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying that they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he found them because one of them posted endorsed comments on the YouTube website about terrorist attacks.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service who was informed about the matter said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement agencies.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the key role recruiters play in identifying future terrorists and possibly more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. Secret Service has made it a matter of urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as doorkeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American wannabe recruits are subjected to a special test by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also seen as incredibly attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the U.S., said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow access to, as U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model so many have already followed?
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded from the negotiators in the city’s Bella Congress Centre more bold action on climate protection.
Protesters said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to amount to about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists ignited small explosives near some government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists migrated through the city with banners that said in English, “There is no Planet B” and one in Spanish, which said, “The Earth says “enough.”
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, her mother’s birthplace, makes her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That’s part of why I decided to take part in the great demonstration – to pass the word and appeal to the world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It’s not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there’s no way around it anymore.
Police prevented demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited at demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing ignited several explosive bodies near the main canal of Copenhagen, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they began as light rockets, but were then followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "That's something I wasn't even aware of."
He then went on in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the general public and different sectors’ concentration on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “one can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people.”
Examination data show persistent racial divide
The testimonies of math achievement were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington, D.C., last week.
Although Washington District is still far behind the country’s high-end schools, evidence shows that fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
However, what is included in the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) figures is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but that of their African-American peers rose only by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 points to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-American eighth graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have achieved has grown over this period, the difference has now hardly decreased by 58 points.
Some education advocates in the district expressed concern last week that the results celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already high-performing children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall ranking by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates for education equality in Washington D.C.
I’m not jumping up and down for a range of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Councillor Kwame R. Brown, who has a fourth-class daughter at Eaton Primary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of exam scores is that the city’s middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we don’t spend nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performing students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, that targets students in the upper classes of primary and middle school who have not mastered the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on from kindergarten to sixth grade games and lifelike experiences, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is credited with some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I think we must continue to work to provide the best measures to students who are below grade levels, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performing schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who is studying urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to target its resources and management reforms to the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could create political repercussions that work against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that she is trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements to closing the performance gap is extending the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the strength to change, Janey said, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he considers to be "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a prospect for the future
The coach arrives at Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eighth graders of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where lessons cost $38,690 per year, was more that of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children attended on their three-day tour and now they have fully embraced the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the U.S. of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education necessary to ascend into the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” of Hispanic Americans completes college – which is a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without graduating from high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who study powerful children say these often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like them get to college, especially if these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then at some point a single measure won’t solve the problem either, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Hispanic-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program funded by Gracielas College Tour is a useful example.
It’s known as GEAR UP—switching up a corridor—and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue running until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The Iraqi oil ministry’s 10 contracts with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that made a bid was the shorter one.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, Asian and European are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns still underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability from the US military’s withdrawal likely prevented American oil companies from engaging more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
U.S. firms were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they don’t have to hold shareholders accountable.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could sign contracts with the ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been assisting with technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its fellow bidders and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
Pre-selected bidders submitted bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner killed in Pakistan
In an apparent U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda deployment planner is said to have been killed this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials reported on Friday.
This would, if confirmed, be the second deadly attack on a senior terrorist organization leader this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan’s lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official of a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency from Miran Shah told by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly took all that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism advocates cited indefinite evidence that Somalis were among the dead.
Somali has been described as a leading military planner for Al Qaeda, which led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy all over the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, pointing to the delicate nature of the US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Taking its central role as a given included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from Al Qaeda’s top leaders and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somalis quickly rose in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best ties with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not in any way reduce the danger he poses to us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a nonprofit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be based on improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
UN chief envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from office in March, ending a stormy term clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concerns that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, which is expected to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he did not resign from office, but only met an agreement made in March 2008 with his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now forwards so that he has time to provide for a replacement.
What I said is that he'd better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun to look for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, in September accused him of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all allegations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith - who was fired - "have undoubtedly harmed the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about the international interference in the election".
Eide said he has recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at restricting his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN hiring regulations have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is disastrous and should not continue like this.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran for not participating in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, declining the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options for election in Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that is on my mind, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, is the war’s own unpredictability.”
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a “package of positive and negative incentives” is needed “to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons” because “your people will suffer tremendously” from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government joined European leaders in warning that Iran must face "believable" consequences if its nuclear program does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear program and forgo a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community standing in relation to some proposals they had already agreed to at the beginning of October, frankly, has brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way that they never were in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set the 31st Dec as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those once called “suppressive sanctions” by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In a statement issued in New York, Iran’s representation to the United Nations condemned what it called Thursday’s “baseless and unfounded allegations” of some Security Council members on Iran’s nuclear activities, saying they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers “to achieve an appropriate long-term solution.”
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to lower the conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to lower U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. Representatives quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government: "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
A change in price in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons have been learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course this summer due to the low birth rate and the aging population, encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and definitive: “No way.”
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously fat, distraught single children, affectionately called “small emperors,” a population crisis in the country is triggering.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time that this policy came into force, according to the UN.
The Department of Population Affairs is set to increase explosively from 16.7 per cent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 per cent in 2020, well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples must have babies of procreative age to “help reduce the ratio of ageing populations and alleviate the labour shortages of the future.”
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the developed countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial order introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplaces.
Chinese officials attributed it to this policy that the critical use of the natural resources of the country could be avoided, whereas human rights officials have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to abort.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions performed, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government officials for the population have gradually weakened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute of Population Research, said that government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to have two children in which a partner is a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out city employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and push through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said that there is a surge in requests from couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
The municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000 still receives as an example only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai community of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and this is legally permitted.
But they, like many Chinese, have only a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsely rate the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are deprived of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she only wanted a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us.
We’re not used to caring for others and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-sized parents with a double career, which lowers the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents struggling during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don’t want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on parents’ time.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "When the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a resume for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group drafts emission reduction plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations -- re-focused on Friday with the publication of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations having to shoulder the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, showed both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a UN working group created specifically for this purpose, is silent about the money supply that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrialized and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature rise should be that policymakers would contribute.
The process is given a great deal of flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN’s leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has described as “the big picture.”
It shows the ground plan of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also boosted the talks on Friday by promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change – from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
The Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the conversations last week.
U.S. Special Representative for Climate Change Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, unless these are financed by the industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is running a harder line with China than Bush administration representatives did not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging economies getting up and taking action, according to Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern issued his statement one hour after China’s Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked “reason” or was “very irresponsible” of saying earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China master global warming.
Because the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, breaking lines have opened up within the industrialized nations as well as between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States advocating for their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of slowing down greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have gone on to act more aggressively in bringing the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change stated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will at best lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members submitted a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the small island states' offensive "exerts political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks received a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the open issues must be clarified before the arrival of the leaders in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister, boarded their planes and rushed through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to set out claims to be negotiated during the next week.
The sheer extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people go in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists host nightly shows in which they make fun of the countries they think are betraying and selling, and draft contracts are hand-to-hand rather than emailed -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 will be government leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
UK’s first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5 a.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will then join Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become lively commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and switching plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic jams.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle, and fears about environmental damage could still hit the brakes on British high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, will hand over Lord Adonis the report on December 30, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, which will connect London to the West Midlands, will run past urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial with a range of five meters.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final track.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger high-speed rail network leading northwards.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route in which a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide into or near Birmingham and a branch west of the Pennines would lead to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said a railroad insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today’s just over an hour.
The drafts give the trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was planned so that 400-metre-long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be in operation on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that London would require an terminus where 20,000 passengers could be handled per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing railway station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued in his opinion, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would keep the travel time between London and Scotland at over three hours.
This is considered a crucial crunch point for ensuring a change from aircraft to rail, a guideline for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Raise for Mortgage for <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orangerie of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservatives’ leading lower house member, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that lower house members have to live "from lean rations", has increased his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-wood specialist farm at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House of Commons officials approved the motions at the time, and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenses of the House of Commons members. Last night, Duncan said that the motions "couldn't have been cleaner or more comprehensible."
Duncan, one of the richest lower house members, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost <0xC2><0xA3>1 million (€1.1 million).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expense checkpoint of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he planted a conservatory, which is referred to in the plans as "orangery".
Neighbors described it as a “glass house for entertainment.”
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased raising of funds during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Standards and Privileges Committee.
The Committee acquitted him of breaking the rules last month after an examination of his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 (€300,000) mortgage from his London home to his constituency home, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election to parliament.
Documents published this week show that by March last year, Duncan was reimbursed approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage interest.
In April, its claims rose to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 (<0xC2><0xA3>2,000) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan’s RBS mortgage did not change during that time, suggesting that the entire raise served to finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 (€85,000) borrowing.
The normal gradual RBS mortgage interest rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying after the spending scandal that members of parliament would live "from lean rations."
"In essence, working for the state means living from lean rations and being treated like s***e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and I am entitled to a seemingly small portion, measured by what belongs to me.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending, when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he clarified with the Fees Office that this could be considered “an exaggerated demand.”
An activist has dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn in the form of a pound mark as a protest after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the raised mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This was approved by both the Fees Office and subsequent by Legg for value increase."
He added: “There is no debate about evading and squeezing or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all of you believers to admire Brighton’s beach hut advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each December day with Christmas carols as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to see the newest hut every day from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, pastries filled with dried fruit.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the cottage decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer clergyman of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, “We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and vibrant place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against climate warming, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to police, and one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the fringe of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place a short time after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, had smashed show windows with paving stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-turbulence police have intervened immediately and without consideration.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their assessment mainly members of "the Blacks Blocs", of these extremely violent splinter groups, who have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April, have been arrested.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction", and has underlined that about a hundred of them "were still held in the streets on Saturday evening," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in sitting position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers, for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters arrived by buses and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were present.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them with sky-blue raincoats, have made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as they have followed the call of Earth's friends to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today, we are going out on the streets to demand a reparation of ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist for the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on like this and tell ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk like never before in the past.
For the first time in the history of climatic diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, figure of the globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly at risk as a result of the warming, has given the start of the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have been on the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and raised bandanas, in which they boasted about solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches of a few hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "coup".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "coup".
Approximately 131,000 people were called to take part in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian Territory, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations were closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the closing of the polling station, according to the Abkhaz electoral commission responsible.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including former president Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under total occupation, his press spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, has explained.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia that is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia wants to prove through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have elected Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to vote in a polling station that was in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes by the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian president and head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to oversee the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition for its part, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus a vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of voting must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, ready for action at any time, have arrested about 700 people, on the verge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which will receive delegates from 193 countries by December 18, in search of an agreement to come into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to invade.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of protesters dressed entirely in black and armed with bricks and hammers began to hit discs, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-rest police immediately encircled you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of them to the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
Towards the evening, a police officer suffered an injury from a paving stone on his chin during the incidents, in which about twenty people were temporarily arrested, according to police. Four vehicles were burning near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said, while the police helicopters were circling in the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by train or by their own vehicle from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in a sky-blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to form a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
“Today, we are going out on the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South,” said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell each other: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, there are watercourses that you can walk through, which has never been the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation opponents has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP and globalisation critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to “connect climate justice and social justice.” “There is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world.”
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are turning to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people have taken to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed in red with bandanas, advertised for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of protesters have also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined forces during the demonstrations organized by the "Netz der 350", particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history stem from the school reform of the lycées.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", that the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the lycées, even if they are not taught compulsory in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Premi<0xC3><0xA8>re (11th school year) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," Mr Chatel confirms.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but rather, by and large, a concentration "of the best pupils."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued, stressing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lyceans."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticized the government project of the cancellation of compulsory education in history and geography in Terminale S (12th school year with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
On the other hand, the Minister replied that there was no question as to a limitation of the philosophy of the Terminale S program.
Luc Chatel also defended teacher education reform, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe is a victim of the pedagogical education of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they underwent a subject-specific aptitude test in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and an admission test at the end of the year, during which their teaching skills are examined.
In addition, they carry out internships during the year in the M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued, "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally stated that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed again that he wants to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to discuss the mission at the Copenhagen Summit: that is the challenge faced by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
According to a journalist from the AFP, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts turn to the audience for fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions.
One would like to do something to reach people and make them feel like they want to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of the day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the basin of the school.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants were selected, including according to their charisma," he explains.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be explained in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told the AFP, who spoke freely in front of about 50 people only with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he underlined, hoping that the listeners may conclude that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school page from December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Delay in payment: angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of prison officials called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtime, whose payment has been postponed until January for budget reasons, are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Penitentiary Officers (FO-Penitentiaire) called on employees who have no service to demonstrate in front of the detention centre on Tuesday morning and block them in order to draw attention to the "theft of what is due to them".
The 3rd CGT Penitentiary Union called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtime, nighttime surcharges and the Sunday and public holiday surcharges in December is branded as "shameful and unacceptable".
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Institution Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The head of the detention centre and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime hours increased sharply in 2009 and not all of them were budgeted, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
According to the Justice Department, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of prison officials guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I am well aware of the staff's efforts to keep our prison system functioning and to modernize it," the Minister of Justice said in the letter.
“I have instructed the detention centre’s management to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, caused by a lack of assessment of overtime, does not repeat itself in the future,” Ms. Alliot-Marie added.
The December wage is therefore meager, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains, for which the "budget constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the inter-regional FO union in Marseille outrages and announces to boycott "all assemblies and convocations" until new orders.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, if the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
“At a time when we are being burdened with more and more tasks without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich ourselves in the money of the staff is more than inappropriate,” said the CGT union of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, observes the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama believes he is always giving Christmas gifts better than he gets himself.
US President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family at the White House for the first time, told TV talks host Oprah Winfrey that he’s always giving out better gifts than he gets.
On a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday evening via the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with from the game.
“Santa Claus also loves Bo,” Michelle Obama reiterates, adding that the dog also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama resolutely rejected her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts: “I gave you beautiful gifts last year,” she teases the president.
"So please," he whispered, pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this one?"
During this one-hour free-atmosphere broadcast with the well-known television host who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved the most as a child.
Barack Obama recalled a ten-speed bicycle and a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us once for Christmas and brought me a basketball," he said.
"It was only much later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from him."
The first lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
“I didn’t know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse,” Michelle told Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operates, RTL confirms he has been put into artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after surgery in France, according to the people surrounding him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer has been put into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on the night of Wednesday to Thursday after American doctors found "damage caused by the operation of a disc incident" he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damages would have required a re-operation.
The singer’s production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was “under control” and said that a new medical report would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the singer's partner during the last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
However, it was only after 48 hours that you had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "out of certain sources" that after its first operation in Paris "no drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau due to a herniated disc.
The surgery was planned for several days by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
He was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday evening.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles due to a subsequent infection after the procedure.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend is going through a "deep valley", but he assured that "you don't need to worry" about the rock musician, as he is "a good fighter".
"He called me to Los Angeles before he left, and I told him it was nonsense to sit on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained."
Mr Camus also stated that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer’s wife, and he did not feel any particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer’s health had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general amazement, it was said that Johnny Hallyday had a “small bowel cancer surgery,” which resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively, and fans and journalists have not forgotten that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to deny a re-entry to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Short track: First place for bouquet over his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, when the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m positions and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m positions of the gentlemen.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to reach the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman asserted himself in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually it is eight) - a premiere at an international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater things and in this case I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
U.S.: Zola grave plate estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman gravestone, which appeared to the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to Sotheby's art dealer.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the 3rd century AD and was always valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, depicting "four scenes of Dionysus in a sophistical architectural decor surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, Vice President for Auction of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, told the AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
“Sales are still ongoing, but this part is certainly what buyers have offered the most for so far,” Sotheby’s spokesperson Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this purchase of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her Paris hotel bathroom, and with Paul Reynaud, minister in the III French Republic and president of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "Erbe von Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil no longer compatible, after this leadership had been rejected by the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
According to the Immigration Authority, the plane provided by the Mexican government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelaya, had returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to abdicate and to ask him for political asylum in foreign countries.
However, the overthrown president declined this, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming, acting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered another failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," M. Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has frequently spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and gladly for ten years, here I have my guitar, the overthrown president who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago added, suggesting some chords.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, as it does not include a request for asylum, said on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Interior of the Coup Government, to the Honduran radio HRN.
I am not seeking asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya had replied in an interview with the Channel Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, would only be undertaken as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors of M. Zelaya’s departure had mobilized on Wednesday supporters of the overthrown president who had set out to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, whereupon the military there had stepped up its deployment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day of the people’s consultation he organized in preparation for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
He had surprisingly returned from his exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
Coup President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the contested election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Cogress had massively voted against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street on the rise, U.S. trade balance nurtures optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed Thursday with a high, the figures of the American trade balance testify to a price recovery of the shares of the United States and their partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the close of the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, has risen from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Advanced Index Standard & Poor <0xCC><0x81>s 500 was credited with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There’s good news from different industries, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotally under the premise that the market is merely focused on "semi-full glasses", she moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly fixated on the figures of the U.S. trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
Analysts, on the other hand, had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the business research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations in the past week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average of new job seekers during the last four weeks has "drop to the low point of the year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has declined.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has risen to 3.482% compared to 3.432% on Tuesday evening, while the profitability of bonds to 30 years has risen to 4.492% compared to 4.408% on the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of Partisans in power whistle out "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of Cuban-powered partisans ripped out the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day, and also thwarted another rally that temporarily arrested a good dozen dissidents.
Around the forty "Ladies in White", wives or close political prisoners, were picked out on the streets by government partisans under Raul Castro, just as they were on the march to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "soldiers!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!" the empowered partisans chanted with a raised fist against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "guarantee their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana on the eve, in which neither injuries nor arrests have occurred.
In the Havana district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also went to the demonstration held on Thursday in view of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, a reporter from the AFP confirmed.
The policemen, according to this journalist, forced the dissidents who were bullied by the partisans of the government using force to board civilian vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is generally limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" organized an unapproved march for the purpose of "Please for the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the dissident list has about 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents of the regime to be “soldiers” or “agents” in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration events between militant pro-government fighters and “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a Unity Party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Insane Kills Eighty-Year-Old with a Knife and Leaves 5 Injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A maniac armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old boy and injured five other people on Friday afternoon at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first data of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old with two knives in or in front of a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, for reasons previously unexplained, and this, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is reportedly succumbed to the consequences of his injuries, according to a representative of the police syndicate Alliance in the hospital.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he knocked on a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were hospitalized, where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life, as he was apparently affected by vital organs, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in the "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who, according to police, seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have escaped on the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of them severely.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives that he wore crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a member of the Hauts-de-Seine Syndicate Alliance.
Several passers-by, including young people, are said to have tried to tame the madman, according to the witness reports determined by the AFP.
I saw a guy in the thirties with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They failed because the guy was well built, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist in the process.
Still on the boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife stitches, according to police reports.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby approached me to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put them in first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person, was injured by cuts.
Police officers have finally arrested the man who did not carry any identification papers.
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre has instructed the district police department of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The insane man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out that he is being admitted to a nervous institution.
According to another police source, it required six police officers to restrain him at the police commissioner's office in Clichy, where he had been deported.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" like "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the procession."
U.S.: Poland's lawyer calls for re-entry of prosecution
The lawyer of French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop prosecution against his client, who is currently on trial at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral violation more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", has denounced gross trial errors in the trial before three judges of the Appeals Court in the second district of California in 1977.
I immediately demand punitive remission, Mr. Hummel explained, before adding that the conduct of the judge Laurence Rittenband, who was commissioned with the case at the time of the trial, “had a cold run down the back.”
According to him, the now deceased Judge Rittenband had discussed with a public prosecutor who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski had earned a penitentiary -- which constituted a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), especially by the prosecutor in question David Wells.
Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September to have "believed" the authors of the documentary.
If the Court of Justice refuses to end the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands the conduct of a trial that would enable him to present the evidence for his reasoning.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion to repeal the offences charged to the defendant cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978 before promulgating the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
Since then, he has not travelled to the United States.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that flight is a way out?
According to her, “the filmmaker begs the court for a favor and thus despises his authority.”
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out that “there are other alternatives to escape.”
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the lifting of the criminal proceedings once again.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by every resurgence of the Polanski affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 at the instigation of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise of the dollar and closes without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed out on Friday in a market torn between better indicators than expected in the U.S. and an increase in the dollar: The Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Advanced Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“Honestly, the market is pretty quiet,” Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
"It remains tightly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than foreseen, which "contributed to improving the market view to the solidity of the recovery of the economy," summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, already two months in a row and far more than expected.
Furthermore, American consumers’ confidence improved significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan Index Preview.
However, the indexes have been slowed down by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level against the euro for two months, pushing down "the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The 10-year return on the Treasury increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482%, and the 30-year return on the Treasury increased to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Miss World re-election in South Africa
After a month of tour of South Africa, the 112 candidates will cross the last hurdle to become Miss World on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world, and this in front of a billion TV viewers.
During this grand beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already gotten their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true whirlwind of pleasures.
Visiting beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was simply extraordinary.
I have seen a lot of things and have had a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with great enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, starting at 5 p.m. (15 p.m. Central European Time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and safari, the Miss are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, every woman’s dream to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, throwing Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defiliate in traditional costumes and not to forget, in swimsuits.
The show will be presented by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a Miss World committee member, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with an almost unbeatable warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, did a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time by bike and tasting the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise a little more for this event.
I'm dealing with people I probably wouldn't be able to approach.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy promised enthusiastically, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in hospital there for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 CET) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "fastly" go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital where Johnny Hallyday was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after surgery on a herniated disc incident on November 26.
The singer was put into an artificial coma in Los Angeles this night to ease his severe pain and perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following herniated disc surgery on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the sickening changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife, Laeticia, attended a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer from the AFP noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Hospital Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer heavily burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told he did the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely outraged, Mr. Camus explained.
I’ve heard that you may be going to court, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "travelled to Los Angeles far too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon".
I personally phoned this doctor, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I myself already have two intervertebral disc surgeries behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced at RTL that the singer apparently had left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist’s environment.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations and not to mention for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer at the Medical Chamber, has described him as "a man without scruples" who is "regularly" to answer before the board of directors and is "everything but recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention was "perfect" and that the post-operative investigations would have been "normal."
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have arisen since last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is quite clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes vigorous and calls on the Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal
The party alliance, which is supervised by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s MoDem party, reacted violently on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and urged him, under threat of a judicial prosecution, not to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political legacy after giving the left his hand.
The defense minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy before the National Council of the NC on Saturday.
To underline his efforts, he had received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who is claiming ownership of the UDF trade mark, since he was the first to apply for this trade mark in 2004 to the "Institut national de la propriété industrial".
However, the office of the UDF party alliance monitored by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrous's friends broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and, under threat of judicial prosecution, set a deadline for the minister and the deputy to stop using this seal and transfer the trademark's property rights to it.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement, the UDF seal to +take over+, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and the senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF+, printed on their political material and on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you are not entitled to the use of this seal, the UDF’s office explained and urged the NC party to “immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (its) website.”
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the trademark's property rights to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978, and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the party "UMP".
According to the signatories, the Nouveau centre party therefore has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They further recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem Party and the establishment of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "at the time when he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF" but the UMP for three years.
He profits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of depositing the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
Furthermore, you give to consider that this recklessness is on the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems more dignified to us in politics as well as in life to make a name for ourselves rather than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently adopting a name on which there are no legal claims."
Liliane Bettencourt: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier convicted of exploitation of weakness
The Nanterre Court on Friday decided to judge artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to sneak up on some of their fortunes.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will face trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum imprisonment of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter fetishes and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in their hands.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly conducted by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions submitted by the Nanterre prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to present a report before March 10, 2010, in which you clearly announce whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these investigations.
I'll talk to her, Ms Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, explained after the trial.
As far as the lawyer of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, is concerned, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he reaffirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to steal donations totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit brought by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ plaidoyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer has appealed to her notary on three letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) sent by his client, in which she wrote that she distrusts the husband of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that for fifteen years, I wrote to Banier once or twice a day.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise I have never been able to speak since her marriage".
The Nanterre prosecutor’s office again believes that the plaintiff had no right to respond in this way, especially because a guardianship judge in recent days has rejected her request to initiate a judicial protection proceeding against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," reaffirmed the prosecutor's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to give a ruling after the admissibility trial of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for the staff to join "values" determined to impose the best as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By placing the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that touches employees in particular.
This demobilization negatively affects the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D, which is even more crucial, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique <0x3D> Economic Intelligence) "requires from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a future-oriented perspective"; it demands from the employees an effort which the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we call for an operational revolution, which would consist in putting the employees at the center of the company’s concerns on an equal footing with the customers.
The Very Conditional Benefit of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will the internal opinion polls, like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its wage recipients, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, unfortunately not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that, in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure is finally about to do primarily what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a much simplified idea of human behavior.
Her interpretation of psychology emerged from the major engineering schools and is mechanistic.
They adopt through intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to leverage the “sic” to employee engagement, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey published by Ipsos reinforces leaders in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for the payees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize some of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take on this conception of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their business on the basis of a predefined Doxa, which allows them to estimate through their perceived image of the company what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, corporate leaders can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and place their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo’s speech: the “just war” brings praise to Obama from the right
American rights welcomed the speech delivered by Barack Obama on Friday evening in Oslo and was pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 defended the notion of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had ridiculed the award to Obama on October 9, applauded the president’s speech this time, following the example of former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 election Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the Republican Party’s right wing in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself raised the issue of a “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of force in Oslo on Thursday; a way to explain his decision from nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, was of the opinion that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words, rejoiced.
In some parts, I felt this speech was completely historical, Ginrich explained, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The previous MP, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen a “left-wing president” who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that “they would not be free and could not award a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist.”
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has given “a very American speech.”
In addition to portraying himself as “cosmopolitan,” as “he always does,” he has “spoken like an American president” when he pointed out that Europeans “live like they live in a safety bubble that they didn’t create themselves and don’t do much for their protection,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as “boring, upbeat and inspirationless.”
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is worried about how Barack Obama defends the use of the armed forces.
If the war is packaged under the guise of the judiciary, it is easy to justify the massacre of the innocent, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, continues to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was given to Obama prematurely, called the speech itself a “monumental work” for a speaker like him, known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "provides a timetable for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California daily said in a statement.
The New York Times believes that Obama “proclaimed the necessary discourse” and describes his speech as “dirty and exemplary at the same time.”
Long-distance driver: Three marathons for an agreement that secures supply at Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained to the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening that put an end to the strike order and the impending severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, State Secretary Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, “welcomed” the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second negotiating night, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement, and the agreement was signed only at 6:00 p.m.
The conflict "would have done a lot of harm to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and of 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
“That’s not a lot, but we’re starting small,” says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now ordered to stop blocking the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a “good agreement” even though it was “difficult to admit these wage increases in the face of international competition.”
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low wage groups and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs by 3% and the maintenance of the total budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable in particular to address the issue of 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the drop in taxes on employers in the amount of 100 million euros" was the subject of a government amendment to the Bill of Corrected Finances for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for an "identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to first apply to the companies affiliated to that organisation and then, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour, to the entire profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The association FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate a part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to drown the goose-eaters on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the association Otre, the agreement "threatens to scoop a large tomb for the small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Paris metropolitan area and the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of the strike between the unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Parisian Passenger Transport Administration), left the strikers waiting with their demands for wage surcharges.
There were no trains on this important shopping weekend before Christmas between 10:00 and 20:00.On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central route only one of four trains was ready for use.
The connection to SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, forcing travellers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big businesses in terms of traffic technology".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains were scheduled to run at high speed, and almost none were scheduled during low-traffic periods.
As on Thursday, there was no crowd on the platforms, as the inhabitants of <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly due to the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), said he had been extra “one and a half hours early to get to work on time.”
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to travellers by staff and law enforcement, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks in the Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left via Saint-Lazare station to ensure access to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers again took place, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a long-term wage surcharge.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself is putting its payroll proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership “is not able to solve a problem, while this was possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF.”
The RATP clarified that a re-meeting for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leader who up to now rejected any discussion during the strike, suggesting a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after a pre-announcement of UNSA and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage surcharge of 120 (USA) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they lament the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travelers travel every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party; a decision that immediately followed angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> told the press four days after the decision.
According to Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political process for a period of five years.
In addition, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party’s goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the verdict that parliamentarians would rather leave parliament than meet like partyless parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish federal court Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, accusing the DTP of following the "injunctions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many other countries regard as a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has “no connection” to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court intervenes with the government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish community and proposes a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to let the support of the PKK by the Kurds fade away and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a resolution could lead to a re-emergence of tensions in Southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP’s premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The security forces used tear gas grenades and water launchers when the demonstrators began throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court’s decision “will deepen the desperation even further.”
"Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, note the editors) question on the basis of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties in principle.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo to the democratic opening promoted by the government," political market observer Ahmet Island said in a statement.
“You can obviously be prepared for a reaction from the PKK,” he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced that seven soldiers in northern Turkey had been killed three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crisp winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
But so that its employees can try out the entire vehicle technology and learn to master it.
This weekend, meteorologists say, could be the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are available to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are run with large scattering vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, main traffic and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire services, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be sprinkled in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which sticks better.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it doesn’t snow until 7.30am.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is ready to make room for the scattered vehicles".
Only then, if it does not snow further, are the supply and development roads, which also includes the Rat-Beil-Straße, the turn.
The last priority is side roads and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o’clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES make their way, and danger points and transitions are cleared first.
The FES usually cannot take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
Since there is smoothness on this fast, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the scatterer is on the go.
If necessary, it will also be called by the police.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s journal Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the spread, and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they carried the remains of a total of five individuals together.
Find confirms theories about dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaurus fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually you can only find individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the allocation of these original dinosaurs is usually controversial.
The experts debate, for example, when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the velociraptor and also the birds known as the "long-necked sauropods" and their relatives, and the plant-eating ornithologists, for example, the ornithologists.
After analyzing Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found clues to airbags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
Accordingly, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America across all continents, which at that time still formed a single land mass as the supercontinent Pangea.
The fact speaks for this is that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot descend from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, there could be a distorted picture, because in South America there are just a lot of primitive Dino fossils preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant land vertebrates of the Earth’s Middle Ages is still enigmatic.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and aeronauts and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while relatives on the border from the Triassic to the Jura died out.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact of a group of animals helped to bloom, which had also developed in the Triassic and since then a shadow existence has been frosting: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California stand on it.
Lecturers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University hits waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, as well as from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students on Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they “disapprove” the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike last week because walls and works of art had been lubricated.
Five students were injured.
The property damage, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The eviction constitutes an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitimization and criminalization of the protest" and distracts from the content.
The Presidium has deprived itself of the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of occupiers did not support the property damage, it said.
Protests legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen Science Minister Eva Kuehne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a Current Hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw this differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they vacated.
The Left has filed a motion calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded site for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Major research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had already established contacts with the Riedberg science site in Frankfurt – with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt the planning department signed Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") received its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Brake Block
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the lowering of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg’s state capital into a heinous construction site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
At that time, head railway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were considered to be 19th-century traffic-technical fossils, which acted like brake blocks of modern rail traffic, as it once took a huge amount of time to span locomotives from rear to front.
Drive in, stop for a minute, continue - that's how it should go.
And that’s why the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which lies about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is actually being tackled now, although the visions of the 80s are far from being compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost invaluable in the Hessian and Bavarian cities to implement lowering.
However, head railway stations no longer have any entry and exit problems, since there are modern reversible trains with trains and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 along with the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now being approached.
Local and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway participates, partly because the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project of the Republic bears the taxpayers and not the state corporation.
In urban planning, the project can still be justified in some way.
A new urban space is created, which - believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, which is ascribed to a huge growth - typical 80s.
At that time, there was no competition from low-cost airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first of all be about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than truck transport on the road.
However, the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy gradients.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly engages with many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be budgeted in Swabian.
This is the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be lacking at other nodes and constrictions on the net.
A total of sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built at a slow-motion pace.
It would be imperative to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley route becomes the bottleneck for international freight traffic: right in the heart of Europe.
Government Reviewes Judgment on Airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag, whether it will go into revision against the verdict of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling legally reviewed, said Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had reasoned in writing on this day that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o’clock, as provided by the state government, is incompatible with the legal protection of the population against nocturnal aircraft noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will go against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises made before the election on a night flight ban, otherwise this would be considered a "word breaking".
It’s damn hard to keep your word, said Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir in allusion to the FDP election slogan “We keep word.”
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel’s accusation that the state government is still trying to come to its night flights with “right-turning and trickery”.
An accurate legal examination takes time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a “quick first impression”.
We need a legally sound decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Just as they represent the opposition, his faction’s statements on the night flight ban have never been.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-shuddered U.S. major banks strip off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repaid the aid from the bank bailout fund Tarp in the amount of a total of 45 billion dollars (about 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.
According to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to refund state aid.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that came with the adoption of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had acquired a good 19 billion dollars of fresh money from investors over convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by division sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had moved to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market in order to exempt itself from its liabilities to the state.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Quick choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors pushed the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the personalities.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the station for this - officially, in order not to preempt the proceedings.
However, it should also have played a role in preventing further damage to ZDF-intendant Markus Schächter, should this proposal not come through with the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for a further five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's deselection was a harsh defeat for Schächter, but one that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signalled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
He organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender, the news broadcasts of the ZDF had lost their ratings, he rejected another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until just before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
More recently, even 35 state lawyers had intervened in the debate, who considered Koch’s actions unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do with it.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance.
He then worked at Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the "today-journal".
Subsequent posts: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morning Magazine"; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after Brender’s de-election, which was still voted Journalist of the Year by the industry magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch’s counterpart on the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, stated last week that the countries should change the ZDF state contract in such a way that personnel proposals of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an extract of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender’s probable successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a clever move – by harshly criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both Schächter and the Board of Directors were able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, without being suspected of taking a party-goer into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is attributed to the left-liberals anyway.
Study is decommissioned
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally steered in on Thursday: At a meeting of the ministers of culture and university rectors conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
In the future, students should also be able to complete their studies.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the exam load: In principle, each study module should only complete with a single exam.
In addition, the workload of the students should be checked and "a realistic and reasonable measure" ensured.
In addition, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examination services between the universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor’s and master’s programmes more flexible.
There should also be no deviating country regulations.
Less testing
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have been bearing the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
For the first time, it was filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to partially drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Every module usually concludes with only one examination," it says in a 30-page paper, which is to partially re-regulate the admission of study programs.
With the “significant reduction in the audit burden,” said Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, “the aim is to stop the development of errors, which significantly impaired the studyability.”
In addition, the "studyability" should in future be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" if "unnecessary constraints of the students in the choice of the
“Events” are avoided.
The students would have "entitlement to gain scope to facilitate and promote initiative."
The rules should apply when admitting new courses of study, but also when reviewing existing courses of study.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years - which means that it will take until 2015 for all courses to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this nationwide, which are subject to the accreditation council established by the countries.
In October, the ministers of culture urged the countries to act on the agencies in such a way that the volume of substances is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In some federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional funding for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities should primarily set up tutoring programs and strengthen study advice as well as examination and foreign offices.
The state and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a amendment to the Higher Education Act into parliament.
After this, only one examination is required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make the design of studies more flexible, to ensure the recognition of certificates of achievement at other universities and to facilitate access to the master's programme.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the country will be checked for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again disputed the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Juso University Groups demanded that the shaping of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest, after the educational strikes, students should now also be "within a word" as affected.
The future academics received support from the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experiences," she said at a meeting with the ministers of culture on Thursday, with which the HRK discussed a common reform paper.
The Bonn decisions did not go far enough for the Gewerkschaft Bildung und Wissenschaft (GEW) as a whole: they demand a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor’s degree access to a further master’s degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that the current generation of undergraduate students will have sufficient master’s study places with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on a freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and leaving is pretty much no control..." is the starting line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he deals with the arrival experience of a dissident, who gained freedom, but at the same time lost his language.
Born in Banat, Romania in 1951, Werner Söllner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable extra-literary upheaval last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, which dealt with "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distortion of its securitisation files".
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner gave a statement in which he admitted to Romanian German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendees, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun slowly, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Sommelier, "someone who has not resisted intimidation attempts by the securitists enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel laureate for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that identifies the abyss and humiliation of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate act IM Walter had played a role, said after the confession Söllners the literary scientist Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He had "cut him out" in all the difficult points for him at the time, Markel said.
It is a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but it is not entirely surprising that a former dissident’s commitment and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July, after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, it may be assumed, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
In contrast to the now very procedurally reliable sighting of the Stasi files in Germany, the handling of the legacy of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic enlightenment has been undermined and hindered.
A National Council for the Processing of the Securities Acts (CNSAS) was not established until 1999, but the publication of the files has been rather sluggish since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, proved an interview in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar said disparagingly about the laureate.
She had a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, unavoidable questions are linked to the case of mercenaries, as so often in connection with blurred guilt.
The prudent response of the listeners to Söllner’s commitment makes us hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the urge for knowledge rather than by blame and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just a nicely dressed salesman coming from a very nice Christmas party where a sports equipment manufacturer had distributed goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the outfitter, climbed into a call-up C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the striking bald had to be chauffeured because of the still foreign city to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - after all, alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with luck, the 55-year-old was just as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work will continue.
Or just really go.
In the words of the Swiss only three days earlier committed: "We have reached the 16th final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the descent."
The “much more important task” is on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the royal class performance in the league everyday in Mainz.
And to eliminate the clearly revealed weaknesses after the fast three gates through Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draws
The Champions League round of 16/17 + 23/24 February/ 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the fulminant beginning of the Babbel successor thus remained restrained.
Not only with the supposed healer, who had conveyed self-confidence, willingness to work and joy of play to the insecure Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to reflect on their strengths, and urged them to be more courageous, the soul-cleaner Gross explained the so simple-sounding recipe for success that had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has sparked a certain amount of magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that one would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamics, became the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new supervisor: "He is a man who digs through and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel it had obviously been lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports board member Horst Heldt
However, VfB Stuttgart needs constancy.
Like Gross, players and managers were also wary of overestimating the victory against a substitution-weakened and completely overwhelmed defence of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at the 0-4 the evil awakening came, Khedira gave to mind.
And sports manager Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was reached, the other was still far away.
We are not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt did not want to celebrate on his 40th birthday even after the first home win in three months was due to the events of the weekend, which came to life in the form of a TV interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of directors of leadership weakness and decided to change coaches under pressure from puberty fans.
Also, that his free day after games had been cancelled, Lehmann regarded as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disgust.
Lehmann’s statements were “infused with pure selfishness,” Heldt wept back and announced consequences for the finalist.
They will no longer be friends for life, the two 40-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with all the others that without the preliminary work by the replaced coaching team, the playful and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants "had a big part in the success," Heldt and Lehmann said unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
World Cup fight in heavyweight
Hot duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson repeatedly provoked World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title after version of the WBC.
The judge’s verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the association WBC defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously on the night of Saturday in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work out with the K.O. that everyone expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance sheet to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give himself up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2.02-metre-sized Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left-leading hand.
However, the eleven-centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly escaped the beaten by the world champion, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to get through the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had caused some turbulence before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
When weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After a four-year break, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
This year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in September.
I only got one blow in this fight and I am physically very good in shape, had Klitschko reasoned the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
However, the British David Haye wears the belt of the WBA after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-metre-sized Nikolai Waluyev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September this summer.
It is said that his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in London's Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand enlightenment from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has assumed a deliberate deception.
The minister had "knowingly told the untruth" about the deadly bombing of two tanker trains in September, said Jürgen Trittin, the Green Group's head of the group, in the ARD news program "Tagesschau".
It’s commonly called: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped trucks, but also about deliberately killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US air strike requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to the NATO investigation report.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak out immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the German government’s Afghanistan policy – and whether the chancellor’s office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The chancellor’s office did not influence concrete operations by the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the representation of the Ministry about the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and fully informed about the background of the tankloader attack.
Officials said they had denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, the two top officials reported that they had even pointed to several reports by the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document by the commanding Colonel Klein and a field fighter report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Bundestag’s committee of inquiry, which wants to constitute itself next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality are blurring, not only in the case of mentally ill and in the drug rush.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we are allowed to give ourselves uninhibited to the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in their growth, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, at least as a peculiar.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the case of mentally ill or in the drug rush.
Guilt is our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes cause the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality to blur.
Dreamlikely altered waking-awareness states can occur in a wide variety of forms, at best we call them visions, at worst delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the brain's neural messengers - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great resemblance of error to dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, delusions of the mind of such a one".
It’s autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity no longer has any power over him, it floats on the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, devilish figures winged with blood-red, distorted frats, tingling.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer tolerate them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, knots them into a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He gets up on a loudspeaker and lays the loop around his neck.
- Jumps.
The sling dissolves.
That's supposed to be a lesson to you, screaming the voices in drum skin-fetching choir, "go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, besides, he is manic-depressive, he is taking medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The deceptions are cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the inside and outside world, they get into an overexcited state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Particularly common is voice-hearing - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate the important from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
They are usually unable to reconcile reality, the illusions are cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers are still posing puzzles.
Exceptional states can cause any person to lose the reference to reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disturbance of the neural system comes about, which is not manifested at all for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Even hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains are hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get some, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether deceptions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irral World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical concomitant symptoms of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and cranial brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brains of healthy people hallucinate.
Hallucinations, according to castes, are composed of memory contents that are usually withheld.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or insufficiently inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also irritation deprivation, stress, love grief or other mental exceptional states.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents reported having experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If not the pictures and voices.
During the break, a sluggish boy with long, dark hair may respond to it.
When it answers him, the classmates look at it surprisingly - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she asks herself sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other delusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are usually scary.
Often, the deceptions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material because the teacher is presenting a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while explaining mathematical equations to all others in audible and visible manner at the table.
At night, the apparitions are usually scary.
If she waits in her dark room for sleep, which is far too rare and far too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the fractures or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don’t tell them that they think they’re crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she made contact with the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from irritation deprivation, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain is then underused and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls daddy has not been her biological father since she can think.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations have the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K., to distinguish falsehoods and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is taking place in the brain, the reality is formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they look so real.”
Even nocturnal dream images value caste as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as irreversible.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our very conscious world, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also contains positive, creative - delusion is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of traumatically altered awakening consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the person experiencing considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state even in hindsight.
The one-iroid state of consciousness arises in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis when fully conscious.
When a person is threatened with self- and world loss, for example by sustained, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
A kind of borderline state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is reflected in the imagination.
An intense form of the foundation of meaning and meaning in a situation that is intrinsically intolerable, which enables us to create our own capacity, not to perish in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, while his body is doomed to motionlessness in the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who produce intoxicants from blood.
When transported by a Greek on a motorcycle to his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the firn snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
It goes up completely in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys are still clear to me after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug rush show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten sums up, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen is an interim solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to be owned by 100% of the family in the future.
Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have prepared the details of this as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only then arises.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
You can’t introduce 7500 employees to your children if they aren’t sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the chairmanship from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member of Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was in charge of technology.
Later, the Treasury department was responsible for the company’s assets and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure, also those for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of balds also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," says Burda.
The holding should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda commented that even family businesses are not safe from the downfall: "This always concerned families who were infected by a capital addiction, who have completely speculated and thought they could thus rise to the very big player.
That was never my strategy.
He has never had “world power dreams,” Burda said.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country as Springer was, and I don't want to play with 'Time' in the World League either, these stores have grown too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that’s what El Corte Inglés has been up to, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2 at the Callao shopping center (Madrid), where everything is all about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide for laser hair removal; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, with rooms to relax and for beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
There is also a food department, which stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many options Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touch screen opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warming up and stretching exercises) are completely enough to train the body muscles.
And if, after you have trained your body, you still want to visit the hairdressing salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments for regaining the beauty, shine and health of your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer, so it’s another good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté, of which one can only advise.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also taking part in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement seeks to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, activities that are related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups throughout Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees a “horizon of calm” for the automotive sector
Prime Minister José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero predicted the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of calm".
In presenting the 2009 economic report by the president of the government, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the government in support of the automotive sector during the year.
“Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we would have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants,” the president said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue producing in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided €800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn generated investments of more than €3 billion.
The head of government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's efforts to boost demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which is applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows for an average reduction of 6% in exhaust emissions from new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in approvals, which increased "by 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classical Automobile Fair will be held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of motors.

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on a specially designed race track in the outer area of the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Eco-friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the Mazda3 model’s automatic stop and start-up system, dubbed i-Stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 stands out for its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good support.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
Looking at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, you can see that Mazda is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
That is why it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can travel comfortably by car.
All of this comes with a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start-up system is currently only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gearbox.
This engine is a real pleasure and stands out for its finesse, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don’t drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-Stop with gasoline engine due to its great comfort in gear shifting and low consumption, even though Mazda’s diesel models are the best-selling models in particular.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, since it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the series equipment stands out above all the assistant for lane change (RVM), which thus eliminates the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough of equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learningable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its handling and the variety of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the tested model Sportive.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us every day the highest level of driving fun.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, radiated more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails without the possibility of seeing certain attachments or surfing the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is still of particular interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success with it, the company has launched two new devices: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free data service, quite unlike the peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but it has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the national border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and a good pair of glasses to be able to read all the small prints.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it’s always amazing that it’s called Fon, although it doesn’t have Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi) can offer these kinds of rates means that the phone providers need to slowly, but safely rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without supplements and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, namely when you buy, and not month by month.
And that’s exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase option with lifelong internet access like the Peek already offers in the USA.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American first lady.
Already upon Barack Obama’s inauguration as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and coat of this color and re-chosen the same color to accompany him at his, undoubtedly, second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: besides that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric -, and she wore something large-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes to the point that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than just one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration she wore a lace dress and in Oslo a patterned velvet dress.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-height heels and the second time a similar model, but gold colored.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair on this occasion was raised as a hair wreath, the previous she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fruitability and Career of Women in Spain" conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market restricted due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they do.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, only work half-day or do not have a fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a permanent position, especially in the public sphere, are shifting the founding of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a permanent job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after contracting, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with a permanent job who have taken longer to achieve this and who have realized their contracting and the first child only much later.
Furthermore, the type of work also has a major impact on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of conception,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have a high school degree or higher education, became mothers on average at 25.1 or 32.1 each for the first time.
Furthermore, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with a major graduation get married before their first permanent job and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school graduation do exactly the other way around and first look for a permanent job and marry after that and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The lead actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous figurehead as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetic company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (" Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (a colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They had all appeared on this occasion.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) the three X-ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-influencing genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a connection to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent saves neither terror nor enlightenment.
Besides the fact that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read over and over again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
On Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt it without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the ominous fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humour, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was enthralled by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions due to adultery united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in getting into heaven on the detour of corruption."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach, one of the 8,000 peaks in world literature, you have to climb up the north wall, the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny chew.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir to a county landowner and again he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams bear witness to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the insane cry that was screaming from a bridge from that Munich personality, so that his echo echo echoed in his literary way until deep into the night of the 20th century. This he did on a journey on which he fled from himself and with a speech full of violence begged posterity before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed: my venerable God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are these verses engraved by Spencer: 'the sleep after the effort, / after the thunderstorm of the port, / the rest after the war, / after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII spied them between the azaleas or sang the birds in Greek.
No other case is known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was even greater than her madness."
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do other than try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroya to Faulkner’s weapons?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he can put himself on this pedestal?"
Feige aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old walked next to her and our dog, our dog is a miscarriage that we took out of the shelter and weighed just six kilos, and then out of the blue they missed him two footsteps and hurt him severely.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on the leash.
In addition to this, the suffocation that a woman who was walking comfortably got when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he will probably do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nearby police department, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything at all and in order to prevent any prejudices from the outset, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation at what happened has prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what has to be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of their commitment to road safety, which "has far more to it than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming more and more safe every day" and further reaffirmed that they are also helping to get one step closer to this goal every day with other actions of educational and informative character.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin emphasized that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to the fact that one of their main goals must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is rising again
After almost two years, the car market for vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008, and, much more importantly, they are the first growth ever after 22 consecutive months of steady decline, in line with the figures presented by the Anfac Manufacturers’ Association and the Ganvam Car Dealer’s Association.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, as the November 2008 reference data used for comparison are a particularly poor year of sales, with a 60% decline compared to the previous year.
However, it should be borne in mind that, apart from the increase last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all the vehicles that make up the van market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter small vans/cars.
Furthermore, there are still the same storm clouds in the sky that are most affected by demand, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the majority of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
Thus, these restrictions, which are the result of the money laundering of credit institutions, must include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support has helped little when buying a vehicle of the 2000E plan.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, but also self-employed and small businesses have a right to buy a van up to 3.5 tons with CO2 emissions that cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday again, Ganvam had reminded us that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealership association predicts a similar year for 2010 as the previous one, for which it expects a sales failure (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-lock braking system back then and as with the stability control ESP, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergencies must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the remaining vehicles a deferral period was set until the end of February 2011.
The action adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many rear-end accidents due to their way of working.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical braking maneuver, which the system detects on the brake pedal based on the braking strength executed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, engages with maximum force in the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to a study by the EU, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assist.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents with personal injury could be prevented - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while exerting a slight pressure on the brakes at the same time.
If the driver reacts, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While the workforce at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) was already informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it takes more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europa, wants to achieve that the affected side gives their consent to every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works may be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision regarding the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American automaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which has backing from the Russian group Converg, is gaining increasing popularity.
If none of these buyers reached an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their newest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, bringing it now only 1,275 kilos to the scale.
In order to create such a thing, they first renounced the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent canvas roof with manual drive, so that alone they saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model such as those of the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by the removal of the air conditioner another 13; in addition, they again reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters with a further 12 kilos.
Then the CDR-30 audio system was no longer used for six kilos less and the missing kilos had been achieved by replacing the door handles with fabric handles.
Although it is also available with the dual clutch transmission PDK, the test drive was carried out on a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on California’s smaller country roads, on mountain tracks that were really very curvy.
In his driving behaviour, you can only give him the note impeccably.
However, the reduction of its weight has by no means led to the fact that it would no longer lie so safely on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not tried such a small and light model, which at the same time gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gear in the required time, until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again...
He does everything you tell him. The car does everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been extremely successful and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration capability is inconceivably brutal, whether standing out or accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads on which we drove the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire track; and that even though we found ice at dawn and roll-splitting in the morning at some of these curves.
To sum up, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as it is usually rather rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl.
The singer, a friend of Karl Lagerfeld’s bust, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of ‘maison’, she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her bags by Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent 82-91 triumph on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight triples the best of his team (29 in the rating).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue-reds, who from the beginning sat at the top of the scoreboard.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come to the field with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was no different, except that the team from <0xC3><0x81>lava opted for an inside game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home, in order to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter already suggests that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was still far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vittorians that on their playing field not everyone wins, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of El<0xC3><0xAD>as" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the fact that the "yellows" turned the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to get air again and at one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the scoreboard again calming distance of (54-67) could be displayed at the end of the third quarter with the host's (54-67).
The Alavesen were bluffed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team strength again by three points off the line (70-77).
Despite this, and although Splitter was put off due to fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well, and although the Israelis were still catching up at the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to resign the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which made the Greeks easier to win.
The team from M<0xC3><0xA1>laga was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of which by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, even though the local team with an inside match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to indicate that the scoreboard in their favor in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which it would have almost come to the fight between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear marks on the Unicaja.
Among their players in the field and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter was characterised by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which proved superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to balance the difference of the game played in M<0xC3><0xA1>laga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the leadership within the group to waver.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many failures and the exit of the Scotsman Robert Archibald injured during the game.
Despite the many drawbacks for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the spring guidance and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope came back to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give himself up and resign the lead toOlympiacos.
How much should you earn based on your profile on Facebook?
Thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, jobs and cars in Spain, users of Facebook can now experience their salary, which they should earn based on their profile.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates users' salaries based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users have a form available on Facebook that allows them to enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker feels on average "badly paid", explains Albert Ribera, responsible for the product Trovit, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, unlike the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months have been those of a driver, half-day job and social worker.
Brazil Calls Zelaya a Date to Leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay in her embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest, when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knew that he must have left the embassy in which he had found asylum since 21 September before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, as his mandate expires on that day and he must seek a new place to stay."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My point of view is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
This week, however, he sought refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed due to Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician whom the de facto government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much!
After the most enticing days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to give indirect liquidity free hand for interest that moves around zero so that banks can buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, begin to scatter some sand into the gear, as the BCE näc already predicted with its annual auction taking place next week.
That is why investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain the economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt is rising again.
The US, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the eurozone in relation to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability until now, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding Spain's valuation.
On the other hand, a certain degree of uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of moral risk who had once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for world economic policy for what they had caused, because they had slowed down the devastating effects which the restriction of loans led to the loss of jobs, when they should have decided on a new day of thank-you action.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and development in Greece has been predicted earlier.
A government that conceals public debt, elections, and a new government that pulls on the same strand.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and S<0xC3><0xB3>crates in Portugal to Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus to grant a euro member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to involve its citizens in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some delinquency on too high amounts, that would now be within the expected range.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, should the European differences decrease and the Spanish increase further, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local preferential indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and to correct their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which do not come back with a Japanese lifetime scenario for the Spanish economy, all promise the long warning.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment it is “cautious when driving”.
Connected branches
Iberdrola’s chairman, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to appear in Parliament’s subcommittee yesterday, where the strategy for Spain’s energy supply will be debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n gave the press some insight into what he had submitted to the Subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion euros by this date by 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it should no longer be invested in increasing energy generation capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
As of 2020, the question will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW more is needed, under the prerequisite of course by other "support energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy, which has just been passed by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, under no circumstances wanted to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, in the long term, “one puts clearly in this direction, in spite of some “individual” measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola described.
Whatever it is, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that decisions on investments should already be made, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-based airport services, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage services at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, on which no figures have yet been announced, is scheduled for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares yesterday signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance is planning investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to study energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction that it is about is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city council wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration decided on a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly European construction companies, competing in the final phase.
The group called Transcity is headed by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia’s largest construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best civil engineering specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium, made up of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield responsible for the infrastructures and the French Bouygues assembly.
The third and last consortium in the narrow choice is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction work and privatisations, but has a hurdle to overcome, as you only get access by buying a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona relies on this geographical area of the highest importance for the industry, in which it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The purpose of the subterranean toll line, which will be funded by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and known as Northern Link, is to connect the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) over a length of 5 kilometres by tunnel, which is the largest measure taken by Brisbane to reduce congestion on the Strait.
The timetable issued by the city administration foresees the awarding for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll line is already to be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, construction work is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex venting system.
The government of Queensland is involved in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For High Depth, Brisbane is already a major business.
Australia repeatedly awards significant orders to Hochtief, who signed a 154 million contract with the government yesterday.
The ACS subsidiary will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber-optic cables through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will provide fast internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane, which has not yet begun, and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools at 25 years.
Initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired through its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers in length for a motorway in Slovenia over the total of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the contract for the construction work to expand the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnelling.
Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will last for over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has credited the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore for a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company said.
This contract also allows for two 12-month extensions each. Sra. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies presenting to this competition advertised by Renfe, of which 4 entered the final round, including TBWA, which has been in charge of advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom for slowing down competition.
France’s competition regulator has fined France Télécom over €63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean.
According to the agency, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed-line and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the fringes of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for impeding its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority that monitors the competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trading
On the other hand, the French company’s subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet to increase revenues from non-telephone-connected businesses.
Basically, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 for this page to be available to other countries, such as Spain.
Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a have won 476.4 million in the Champions League since the start.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has developed into a source of income for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, which brings them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only fame, it is also one of the main sources of income for the major clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) who have participated in this event since its inception in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and which, in addition to AC Milan, is the only one who has won the trophy three times.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup 1992 occupies fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also earned the most money from their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place among the countries that were able to take money from the champions, although it has more titles than anyone else (five, unlike four at Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distributed
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money allocation procedure that UEFA applies.
This fiscal year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini expects 1,090 million proceeds from the Champions League.
UEFA provides 413.1 million of this money for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a participation received 3.8 million through their blonde presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (€800,000) and a draw (€400,000 per team), and the clubs that entered the round of 16 will receive three million each; the four that entered the quarter-finals will receive 3.3 million.
The last four will each receive 4 million.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a again earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
In addition, however, there are the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is given proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year’s Master receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa Offers 61 Million for 29.9% Share in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group has leaked details of the purchase offer of shares yesterday, with which it intends to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, paid out to ten years and at an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a period of 15 days to communicate their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos reaffirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
At a close, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos would be 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In an attempt to stay on the brink of potential purchase offers and the judicial turmoil of his ex-managers, the brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as head of internal accounting.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position at the food company.
This is a newly created position, which is directly subject to the chairman of the group.
This is anything but free of polemics because the company is involved in a judicial battle on suspicion of redirecting more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will be shifting further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar’s credit, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday, confirming that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their determination.
CNMV approves Paternina’s public exclusion tender submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender for the exclusion of Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer last October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been proven that the conditions comply with the law in force and therefore the content of the submitted explanatory leaflet, following the amendments of last 2 December, can be considered "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the share capital composed of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It has also been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the applicable laws.
New Vehicle Assessment Programs
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an appraiser must assess the damages incurred and the cost of the repair.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including the parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools, it is a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of reviewers use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process it afterwards and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all expert opinions are created with their products.
The other two companies competing in the tool market for reviewing and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched on the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car enters the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because every single one of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, an "intelligent" graphic image is created from each model, on which you can "click" on different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the process proceeds quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months, and currently Audatex has complete information for 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the fleet of vehicles on the roads, it is over 99%.
In order to carry out documentation work and create databases, Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics specialists) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the file or residual value of a car.
The only company that provides information about the value of used cars in Spain through a guide is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
By reviewing the products Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products being AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose, i.e. for each expert report.
It is most expensive for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that makes thousands of reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can completely identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran off the assembly line, solely by means of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windscreens, and AudaSubastas is an open service for the specialist market on the Internet, with which you can offer for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, it can be used to investigate how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this kind of computer tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and provides in the same way digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT expert guide is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 assessors and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 their turnover amounted to EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in 1966 in Germany and established in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The total turnover in the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group bought a plattfom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer more services and value to its customers, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This appraisal and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, appraisers, car rental companies, workshops, scrap sites and car dealers, who have to register before their activities.
Founded in Germany in 1996, this platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
3,000 ads are managed daily and 100 new ads are added every day to the Spanish market.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value may be re-approved, even if they have been unsubscribed after difficult government procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, of which 666 are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified based on the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the working hours, surcharges or discounts and then have the cost estimate printed out and passed on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for reviewing such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
Audatex is currently working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time, because you can choose a door with it, for example, and then turn the picture completely around to look at the inside.
