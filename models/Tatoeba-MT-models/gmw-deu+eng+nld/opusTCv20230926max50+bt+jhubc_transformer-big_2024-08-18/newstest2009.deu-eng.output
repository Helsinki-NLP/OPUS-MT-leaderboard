The Prague Stock Exchange plunges into a downward trend against the close of business.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with the shares of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ reached almost half of normal day-to-day business.
At the beginning of Tuesday’s business, the Prague Stock Exchange began the break-in from Monday, when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the break-in on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which it had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the local financial sector, is shown.
Stocks fall in Asia
A dramatic fall occurred on Tuesday, stocks on the stock exchanges in Asia, although indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was later able to offset some of the losses, thus decreasing to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observes the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then decreased losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
“The timing for the rescue operation in the U.S. is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the burglary.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion K<0xC4><0x8D>) should be spent.
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
American stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the largest slump in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by nearly 7%, with a similar decline last seen in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any indications that the draft would not come through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress Makes Concession: US Government May Pump $700 Billion into Banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. legislators made a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of a $700 billion grant to the U.S. financial system (approximately 12 trillion kroner).
However, this does not mean a victory.
Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final draft of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank told Reuters agency.
In the Senate, according to various figures, the plan could probably be voted on at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first significant psychological factor for a revitalization of the financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms that could help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like," Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
According to them, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of unavailable mortgage assets from financial companies, which plunge the financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective in the market.
You have to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're on target," Paulson said.
A Signal for Asia Businesses
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress before Sunday.
It aims to calm investors from doing business on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a congressional decision could affect business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether the negotiations at the last minute could still fail at a problem.
Legislators hope it will be passed in the next few days.
However, the law will still undergo some changes.
The total amount of aid to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
But Congress can block the distribution of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, at another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush sees progress in negotiations as positive
The president has a veto right in this decision, but Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained, based on obtaining finance for the purchase of poor mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was “satisfied with Saturday’s progress and appreciated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, concluding perks, and setting a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to oversee the fund.
This should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new installments on mortgages it purchases, with the goal of lowering the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because you don't know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive, according to Marek.
“It is much more important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement about a passing is the most important thing at this moment," Marek emphasized.
Duel on Messers Schneide: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls yet.
So, of course, it is better to just buy a phone.
Despite all this, there are plenty of reasons why you should get a stand-alone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
It’s hard to buy a great, expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for them.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with music on travel, i.e. with compressed music, expressed in a simplified way - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a pink-floyd fan will probably hardly use headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is broad.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what cell phones can do, they don’t even make sense.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the Simsen, it can play music and videos, record both, it sometimes has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smart phones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should count on the cheap phones that they can’t play music for more than a few hours.
If you still make phone calls from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation at once.
Another problem is if you want to transfer the music to your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB port, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can cope with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without any reduction.
For players, except for exceptions (iPod), you do not need special software.
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only map the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
If music is primarily a backdrop for you and you listen to it only briefly every day, for example in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which almost every cell phone can do.
You also do not have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is among the most widely used, and moreover, most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile internet, and you can buy a song or album.
This service can in and of itself be a striking argument for why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is usually limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can access the built-in speaker that almost every cell phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of the music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players in turn lies in the easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the formerly normal cassette recorder or, for example, the turntable is obvious.
There is no threat of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile internet and a subsequently horrendous bill for data transmissions.
Which device should you use now
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But be careful.
Basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, then reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you prefer to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have stand-alone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes close to that of a single MP3 player.
The widest here is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kroner, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours maximum) provide you with MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all the services offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics at lower prices.
Maybe it won't be long.
That the Czech mobile operators work among the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
Incidentally, this was confirmed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> telecommunications authority, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps taken by the European Commission in regulating roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely – for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a battle announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
The mobile operators, on the other hand, like to grumble about the fact that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
In addition, the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, who has often said in the past that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic, often agrees.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has very many chances (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies).
However, there is one more option - a virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market that led to a significant price reduction, which the classic mobile phone providers then also had to react to.
Before companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK, there were similar voices as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, it doesn’t take long to look for examples.
In February this year we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the fifth largest provider in the country.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a classic provider.
They do not require a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually stand out as low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which, however, is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
Tesco Mobile, for example, offers SMS in the UK at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be quite a good move to target a non-cliché target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"True guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operating company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also gain a foothold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>’s spokesperson said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offering."
In the Czech Republic, mobile operators mean
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile service provider conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries of our region," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, press officer for the Penta financial group, in a telephone conversation with Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Your interest in launching a virtual mobile service provider has long been demonstrated by the GTS Novera Group, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the corporate customer segment.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line, but also mobile telecom services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we were already able to achieve negotiation progress," said Pavel Kaidl, the group's press spokesman.
Maybe better times are coming.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, no subject with a complex and reputable project in this area has addressed us," says his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the press department of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2.
Other providers also point out the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile press spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> rarely agrees with O2's statement: "So far, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on."
She added: “By the end of the year, hardly any virtual provider will appear on T-Mobile’s network.
At this moment, we would already have to have a concrete offer in order to be able to think in such a short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we regard as the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The approach of the mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would be called more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also a decline in profits.
So why should it be easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> came from T-Mobile at the time U:fon was launched.
This is also evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> commented: “The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, on its services."
In view of this approach, however, mobile operators are surprised by the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
This is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other advanced countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, referred to this whole issue as its very typical attitude.
“The market entry of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile service provider and a virtual service provider about the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential prospects was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," said Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS External Relations Department in his response to our request.
Representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a formulation.
This is more than worrying from an authority that is supposed to represent consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position in the market.
In particular, when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Across the country, where virtual providers work normally, it can be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services."
But probably the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are not among the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Really shocking in this case is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same gasoline price at the gas stations is certainly just a coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs of anti-competitive action in this matter, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way whatsoever.
None of the providers have a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their trading in the market.
The necessary tools to open the mobile market for virtual providers are likely to be missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many disputes.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, elaborated by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, after which telecommunications from the perspective of economic competition is a single market.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators hold a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the approval of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has - logically - the monopoly for his network.
This means that it necessarily assumes a dominant position in a particular segment.
But even if you don’t agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile service providers are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The transfer of responsibility to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Act, it has not been possible to enforce the extension of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS only need to know all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It is possible when no one is looking
The functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Our own mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company acts towards the operator as a classic business customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"Should there be cases that you describe, then it can be a breach of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to an end of cooperation with the relevant company," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> replied to our question on this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not go around among the responsible persons of the mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
In fact, the activities of these companies are not to be neglected, and at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out possible problems: "The law allows for such types of speculation, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run in their name, so they cannot have full access to it like the normal customers of the mobile service providers.”
But at least that would have to be strange.
In addition, another question arises for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Before such a procedure, mobile operators close their eyes, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong competencies to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration by the providers that they do not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers led to a significant price decline in the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have been created, the classic providers have tried to prevent their creation virtually more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that the regulatory bodies intervened, which in no way sought to protect the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and followed by more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competencies in these cases is more than favorable.
But let’s not throw the flute into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider is coming up soon, the Czech mobile market may soon be moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain idle when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will then finally no longer make more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Wo ist mein Heimatland on the occasion of the day of the Czech statehood in a ceremony.
The hymn was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The vocals were taken over by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek, the Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he had told Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular for the solo variants.
"From the very beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both of them and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well, so that there is a harmony," the conductor said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first sounded in 1834 on the stage of the Ständetheater in the original Czech piece Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl, the music was by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the meaning of the "new" hymn
Prague transport companies also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague transport companies as a date on which the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in their pockets instead of a paper ticket enter a metro, tram or bus.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or yearly coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it added to their chip card at the same time at the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the subway stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Rozby Let<0xC5><0x88>,
Since yesterday, the coupons are also available via the internet on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the internet sale can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the internet, it is played on the open card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places, travellers also have a desk with trained staff at their disposal, which advises interested parties when buying online and also plays the coupon on the card," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, the spokesperson for the project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-service machines on the open card, which are attached in some subway vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket devaluers, the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
“There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it will be eighty,” Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The coupon checks an automatic instead of the driver
The operation of the vending machines, which will work from tomorrow, is simple.
All you have to do is insert the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon will play itself.
From tomorrow, the electronic coupons will apply not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants of municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia get to the capital.
"In trains belonging to Prague's integrated traffic, train attendants have reading devices that allow them to check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the organisation Ropid, who compiles the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's ticket office.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked place on the side of the checkout.
In this way, the driver checks the validity of the coupons played.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal said.
A passenger who does not travel on suburban buses and no longer knows when the coupon will end, can go to the self-service machines again, where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudets demanded a referendum from the United States.
The Sudeten Germans had asked for the integration of the Bohemian Forest into the United States in 1945.
This is evident from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the US president in 1945.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units are entering German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads.
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - would expect brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the Bohemian Forest as a guardian for now and forever.
“We cannot believe that, without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are addressing a foreign state to us, which is trying to oppress and eliminate minorities and has not contributed to the victory of the Allies at all,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president has doubts about the attitude of the Germans in the Bohemian Forest, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forest on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or wish to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naïve in today's knowledge of post-war history, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, it paints a good picture with regard to the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans at least had to suspect that one would negotiate their deportation from the republic, only a few of them agreed to such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was employed as a Budweiser German in the Navy at the Baltic Sea during the war.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would come to them," Chalupa said.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotional campaign aimed at drivers
The most expensive action for safety on the roads in Czech history.
This is also how the emotionally charged media campaign could be characterized, which the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to deter drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to keep drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remind you to gird up before starting the ride.
The campaign aims, above all, to convict young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are written in capital letters on a license plate.
And then in a bloodthirsty spot there is the word "pay".
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see quite normal images with drastic images of accident victims.
It is expected that the number of accidents and the number of road fatalities on the Czech roads will fall.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Bread of sugar and whip for drivers
"The motto of the drivers is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that when they drive at red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said Na Homolce Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n, a transport psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, according to the psychologist.
In his opinion, boards that alert drivers to a danger are even less effective.
"If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be reached with Palestine and Syria in exchange.
He emphasized this in an interview, which was printed by the daily Jediot Achronot on Monday.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it becomes necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to hand over a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) to the Palestinians because there will be no peace without it,” he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templar and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert called for Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights,” Olmert said.
"The Syrians know all too well what they have to do to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they provide to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Qaeda terror network and jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, walking in a long-distance bus is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency near the Italian city of Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk back and forth on the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck that crossed the bus’ path.
The young woman sat at that moment to all the misfortune next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply at the moment when the steward carries coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is also equipped with standing seats according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, passengers must be seated.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no standing places, as confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, to Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not agree with the movement of travelers at first.
Later this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that travelers may go to the toilet while driving if they have their seat," he said.
The law doesn't know a steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the term vehicle companion; however, it does not define its rights and obligations," the spokesperson for the Ministry of Hanzelka adds.
The director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the law subsequently covers this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product approval.
That is all," he said.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, the expert says
The BESIP specialist for road safety Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"With a liquid way of driving, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it's not clear when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can bump her head."
“But if a bus hits sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in a city bus or a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations," he says and also believes that this problem is not fully solved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company that offers services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider her profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be provided to travelers upon boarding.
That would also reduce costs,” he says.
Asiana Alexej Litvin, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, is interested in safety in the absence of stewards in his buses, but his company operates only a fraction of the lines compared to the Student Agency.
“We don’t have stewardesses, but we’ve been fighting against them from the start.
Sooner or later this will end with some fatal accident," he had said for T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz not quite a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a regular bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was injured.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the stand strip without blinking and had blocked the bus’s drive.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two seats had been sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck driver.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but expects a financial compensation from the culprit.
A law change?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation that a thirty-strong team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working on for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the stewards' activities to be something that could significantly jeopardize the safety of travellers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses being in the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter of the WestLB board to the employees of the house.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf-based financial institution with the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could emerge, according to the letter announced on Monday.
WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And in any case, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the state banking sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the affected WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government has recently made clear, the time has come to find a solution for the future.
However, there has been talk of a connection between the Deka-Bank, which is known to savings banks because of its investment funds, and the WestLB - also on the Frankfurt side - for some time now.
Although Deka-Bank chief Franz Waas informed us at the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August, he sees no sense in a merger of the house on Mainz Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is half supported by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbände, has commissioned the Management Board to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have only just begun, it is said at the financial centre.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the more important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre, is not the first time to be mentioned when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, nothing came out of this trio.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government opposed Helaba’s participation in them.
The other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been thought games about a connection of the Deka-Bank with Landesbanken.
However, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had recently spoken out against plan games about a meeting with his house.
However, regardless of this, the realization seems to mature that the different houses of the public sector are in need of a merger.
Now that the state election in Bavaria is over, BayernLB could move closer to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
Should the pressure for further mergers increase, the partners gradually go out for it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far endured the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, pushed a bar at the beginning of the year to merge with West LB.
At least it was the Nord LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is about how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question with which business model the future viability of the Landesbanken should be ensured had not been answered by the German Savings Banks and Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a dismantling of the West LB, which, of course, is not desirable there.
This is also the case in the letter of the board of directors there, that a "total solution" for the house is in any case sought.
How this can be combined with the merger of individual units with the Deka bank will still be shown.
The second meadow weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena, it is the first time, for Luca, it is the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded beer and proves to the about 200 Oktoberfest travelers, what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena first gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From here, the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrive at this evening at 11.45 p.m., expected to arrive at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved mainly for Italians, in a bus only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing next to their flag already, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says, this is not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelcimitate lining and glasses with wide silver temples, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours are on their own this year.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, back at 10.30 p.m.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity requirement, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada towards "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
Quickly it becomes quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
There will be a stop in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates will take a break on the motorway 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Oktoberfest", in fracture, next to the Internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors open to the beer tent, it's called running!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we'll block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, spread out in the room!"
The measure, Marco roars, cost 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to tip.
"Security people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone.”
Thirdly, "To find point half past eleven again here tonight!"
And now we're going to Wiesn.
Along the way, a yellow cap binds as roadmarks to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
They want to be prepared for retreat.
It is the second weekend of the Wiesn, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There are no exact figures; we are talking about 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and invade the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are said to have travelled extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains a nationwide statistics in which the Italians take the first place in front of British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies.
Especially popular with Italians is the Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also interwoven that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisisful developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
The Munich-listed real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks in order to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part that it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses in the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier had refinanced himself extremely short-term for long-term projects for which he has loaned money - which is now no longer possible due to the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, while the equity ratio had also slightly declined from 1.6 percent to 1.45%.
Current earnings and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, earnings from attributions to receivables and certain securities as well as from the dissolution of provisions in credit operations had fallen by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher earnings from reimbursements of downstream settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the Tax Code and from the business management for group companies, the earnings reduction had still been moderate at around 16 percent.
The former state financier had first speculated with commercial real estate loans after his privatization in 1990, which had then been outsourced to Aareal Bank.
Because they did not earn enough in the classic state financing, the Depfa had then become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite indefinite.
The fact is that the dividend has been canceled.
By 2007, it had been cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has again largely dried up as banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds to be refinanced annually for part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – around EUR 50 billion.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is “shielded from the influence of the currently largely incapacitated international money markets”.
It can be heard from other sources that thanks to the funds, the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke said, on the other hand, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is hoped for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty.
In fact, it is not unthinkable that the financing does not have to be fully utilized.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank was reportedly facing insolvency on late Sunday evening, the at least provisional rescue could not calm the minds.
The share price drops by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, bond prices are quite good.
While the priority debts are barely moving, the rates of the subordinated bonds drop more clearly.
The bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009 are particularly affected.
If hypo-real-estate bonds were formerly a speculative investment alternative, their worthiness must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant exacerbation of the banking crisis and of the institution itself, which had only come into being with the takeover of the Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, a timely repayment of pensions can be assumed.
Or what hardly anyone dares to hope for right now is that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that are overlapping with the partial nationalization, the probability of security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This is especially likely to give long-term creditors some sleepless nights with the decision to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can at least use a closing line to form a loss presentation for future payroll tax payments on price gains later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to giggle: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before I went to school, I had Bammel.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train to Tachibana High School for 40 minutes.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The start of the lesson at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strictly defined as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students swirl in from 8 a.m. until at twenty a.m., a brief round of meetings begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the type of person who likes to talk to people, nor to talk to a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, plus blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language a good two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all hugged, crouched and wanked and I have heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I knew this from my manga.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly squeezed into my place.
The girl next to me grinned quite broadly, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really stormed.
Everyone talked and giggled and asked me for holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of their bentos were unpacked.
My host mother had also made me such a lunch box - this is sometimes something different from the rude German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in tofu coat.
I usually don’t know what I’m eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is certain that everything is really tasty.
Well, except for the salty pickled plums maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which she then especially artfully prepares - in the hope of getting to know the boy during the break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this as well.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
“Because it fascinates me.”
I have been reading manga for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in them, I also started learning a bit of Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a passion for tradition, customs and customs.
And they are very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends – on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats have feelings too.
A rat or a crab fleeing in danger means that she also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same when they behave in the same way as we do?
For several years now, the Internet magazine "Edge" has published contributions by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address questions of feeling or generally of consciousness, we enter unmovable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it kills, flees, or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, from which some scientists suggest a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least with those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever it may be, probably differs greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or analyzed on the basis of our own experience, because of the special hardware, his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more readily accessible scientifically.
One could study the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But with this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one relies more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the development of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I trace them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and in particular humans.
Linked to the linguistic nature, fine gradations of feeling result, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-gender sensations.
In theory, I cannot contradict this, but I think it is unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans probably also feels like this in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A scavenger flees in danger if she too feels fear?
In my view, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove experience equality.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, on the other hand, scrapes do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this to people: How did you want to prove it to rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even scrapes (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is being made here at the neural level, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I do not research language and consciousness in rats, nor do I research sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You might think it's short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than running against a wall all the time.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Deadline for grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as a testament to their confidence in Ukraine and their ability to host the European Championships together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can no longer waste time.
We now have to work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian association president Grigory Surkis.
UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time.”
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act by the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that preparation for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer."
Several first leagues had been convicted of forced resignation last season alone for manipulation, after all, even the league start had to be postponed briefly.
Outraged Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about privates in an interview - and now has trouble with ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her late Dennis Quaid as a adulterer.
He shudders and strikes back.
Delayed rose war with ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now face an unpleasant dispute with each other - in public.
In an interview with InStyle last week, Meg Ryan said, “Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
The extent of the fraud was only discovered after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - telling the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: “It’s monstrous,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that “Meg, for the time being, chews and re-densifies the story of our relationship.”
It is also "unfortunate" that the 16-year-old son Jack is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that signify a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so his admissions conclude with the side blow: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Prices of air tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again – this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following a rise in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decline in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, overnight stays have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most marked in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is that American Express sees the weak dollar price, which has led to a “decreasing desire to travel by American tourists.”
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with a 26.3 percent increase.
In the first quarter, the trend for air fares also showed upwards:
Due to the fuel consumption, economy-class travellers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even more expensive than 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for economy-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first-class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent, and decreased by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
The reason for the price drop was, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
Signs of the tense situation are the cancellation of unprofitable routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - these were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes a table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a functioning elf.
By Kristoffer Klein increase break landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher only came into the game late and failed with a lifter to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, it went convincingly through his lips.
He knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger sighed in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist at the HSV for nearly three decades, he enjoys a higher reputation than some late actors.
And so his request was heard in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and agreed to raise his thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg’s head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have been similar: Come with Gate Two!
The implementation was discontinued.
"It wasn't all nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Bastian Reinhardt would have wished for it to be "relaxed".
The Hamburgers owe the 1:0 (1:0) to the header hit by Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class primer.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify that," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular interim witness represents more the unpredictability of the league than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late commitments - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric and the Jansen advertised by FC Bayern - find themselves slow, but she is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the vote defeat
On Wall Street, the fear goes around.
Initial news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to break down by 700 points at times.
That was the biggest point loss in a day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer recorded a good five percent minus 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down by more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was in the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could win.
The shares of Goldman Sachs declined by almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds will be made available for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid out at once, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock option notes from financial companies, which could be redeemed with appropriate price developments in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and USA in downward trend
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not address the doubts of investors.
The share price of the German large bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and rips the Dax down.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing despite the state’s planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the German Stock Index (Dax) down.
Despite the bailout of the German government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier’s share temporarily lost three-quarters of its value, while Commerzbank declined by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the psychologically important 6000-point mark, noting a 3.7 percent drop at 5,839 points.
The stock markets all over the world fell to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to get the financial markets back on track.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDax, Arcandor shares declined following the announcement of a capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter affects flight from space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has been causing futility: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory might not be quite right.
For almost 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" flew through space.
Due to soon freezing fuel lines, you are now threatened with cold death.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists – the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What has surprised the researchers for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent the way one would expect under the old-fashioned gravitational law.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They called him swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, may not be quite right.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes Einstein was not mistaken, trying to explain the swing-by-anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is evidently a force of attraction, the effect of which can be observed on other celestial bodies.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not transmit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, in particular no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter accounts for about one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists who were abducted in Egypt are to be free again, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom money.
Six hostages were reportedly killed in a shooting prior to the release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Germans are constantly targeting kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab TV channel Al-Arabia and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are currently reviewing their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are well and safe, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed surprisingly six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the official said.
It was “just about taking the hostages in” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot down six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them.
The hostage takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained until the hijackers have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "leaded to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather has resulted in a woman killing herself, a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after confessing to eight sexual abuse cases.
The Tribunal in Truro learned that he regularly imprisoned his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle was killed at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had bound her and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was prosecuted for the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "gave up her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended up saying, "I used to tie her up and tie her eyes."
“I didn’t force her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been frightening, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I note the impact, according to Stephanie's father and mother, her actions over the years had on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would have clearly been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was deposed by the Department of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest indictment within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally at the Department of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named will be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause that deals with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he relocated included classified assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies look at B&B costs
British housing companies could have cost more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million in the house after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, director-general of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), said it was “unbearable” that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s loans are cancelled.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is credited each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now called to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay together about 18% of the costs.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
That means that companies must raise <0xC2><0xA3>81 million for the first year’s interest.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate boom are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the records were made in 1945.
"We will be watching all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
Interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per liter more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per liter from Monday.
It’s the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after a consulting firm’s investigations have been conducted.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Prior to the price increase in February, the wholesale market price of Jersey Milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defendants said the court refused bail on the charges of blackmailing 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government should first grant her unrestricted freedom.
The correspondents say that although her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release whether she will be able to continue to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she doesn't need to be given a bail because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers claim that she needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami alliance party chairman said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the Army-supported transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or impede the thousands of employees carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its lawsuit against the Competition Commission’s decision to reduce its share of the competing ITV channel.
The Competition Appeals Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications office Ofcom have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New Investigation in the U.S. Prosecutor's Affair
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the dismissal of the nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the justice system.
Serious allegations including criminal action have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice dismissed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their peers, causing many observers to consider the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of Democrat election fraud.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has been under fire for the dismissals and has finally resigned his office.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The report of the Inspector General, in particular, has critically addressed the role of Gonzales, bearing the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, "giving up" his leadership role and "exceptionally disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the inadequate cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell" during the music award ceremony "Q Award".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize in London next week during the award ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" lists the nominations for this year's awards, after being narrowly selected in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such things as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years on the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, including surgery in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute larynx inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side streets and other bypasses, some of which are famous and others just convenient.
Still, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time residents, it’s hard to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an active passageway.
There are also no road signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that has recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-pave Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says she is fascinated by the short lane, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the block of houses.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council’s Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the City Council and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the construction company’s purchase of the road.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the municipal council 3.
“Only very little space has remained in the city’s possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it will re-pave the small street and set up seats that are intended, among other things, for a café to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during the meeting this month.
A spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, Michele de Milly, said the company wanted to use the road, but did not want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Building Protection Department, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the road and stressed that the department’s job was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was split between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by none.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock monument, which closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The pavement was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, sheets and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged city splitter that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's vanishing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Extinct City"), has published part of the talk of city history about Extra Place, which was published in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac that even remains dark during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and week-old newspapers flying past rain gutters".
With a few exceptions, the street looked just like it was recently in one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bunch of discarded newspapers.
Some passersby said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up a bit.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, damp, and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this edition of the Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior research associate in Caliphonic Studies and senior director in the Department of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Selection".
Talking to Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the likelihood of successful completion of school among African-American and Hispanic students is lower than that of white students” – which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transitional phase in education for those who first learn English.
Yet the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles, for example.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than one third of students, many of whom have recently been in the country, are learning English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, an astounding 100 percent of fourth grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school were rated as good in the English exam.
This astonishing success has been achieved with other methods than those favored by Obama.
Sixth Street School places its emphasis on review and practice, on constant control of knowledge, and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach according to which the education runs in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly the point Obama is supposed to consider, according to school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach attaches importance to the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him anymore.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national imagery associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation aimed at “English only.”
Instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than contempt and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The oil price fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets could not suffice to revive the economy.
Crude oil futures trades on the New York Stock Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel during the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulence on Wall Street and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month, then rose again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have shown concern again, even though congressional representatives had announced they had agreed on a rescue plan this weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far from complete.
In the for now final chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is expected to buy up the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it appears that it has not succeeded in revitalizing the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Deutsche Bank analysts have written in a statement to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.”
The bank’s analysts have lowered their oil consumption expectations due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and their oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 have been reduced by 20%.
Team record set by series in second quarter
Defender Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen it all, after spending the last eight-and-a-half years running up more than anyone else in the jets jersey.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like this before," said Ellis.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon where their evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one of which slipped out as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
“I didn’t put in a lot of effort,” Coles says about the passes that went to Coles.
“He’s a super player.
Our vote has been voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catching, the defense took apart quarterback Kurt Warner.
Defender Darrelle Revis caught an accidental throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss to Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets regained the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to the 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
In response to both, as the jets scored 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Exhausted Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to reach the 42.2 kilometres in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the win on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has reached at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometre to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, out of fear, perhaps exaggerated in hindsight, that air pollution could worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long distances, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and could not train for a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and did not return rusted.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end it was all great."
He was criticized for – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rival from East Africa – orchestrating his races excessively, avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a rail race, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the track in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had subsided.
Just over three miles ahead of the finish, Gebrselassie made his last appearance to separate from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a considerable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She cleverly planned her run by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners torn out first, but overtaken after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the hardships in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Tucked away between the amusement parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, noisy and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquettes, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writer’s Project at the time of the depression – remains in many ways a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is so independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about racial relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth a resident of the city and a community member of the oldest church in the city.
It must be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the – sometimes condemned, sometimes praised – black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And really, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown in books that came from the heart and were written by mouth, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through Florida’s often-forgotten center, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Like Oskar in real life as well as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Beyond the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and always fits in with hourly rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
“Zora described things the way they were,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to town, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in pants, in a city that even today imagines something of her venerable clothing style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Mr Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he was swinging in his chair, on a rear-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville, there was no major commemoration, no public readings on a grand scale.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main road of the community.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting away," Mr. Franklin said.
“There was once a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s demand to enforce integration by describing its decision in the Brown case against the school board as “offensive rather than respecting my race.”
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being embraced - I remember - hugging his teacher in the morning and hugging his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the nonprofit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"They didn't hug his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped create room for more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors, and artists who set themselves apart from prejudices, as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, “How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set off to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelves, and again made it a part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came exactly at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many return every January for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway invigorated the city, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, aroused genuine citizen pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd put it a little simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
More and more people have come here, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals have begun to re-appreciate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (named Hurston of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: just 6 miles from Orlando city centre, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black today.)
Outsiders in search of Eatonville’s history and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, a permit is required in advance and certain things - such as the mural painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in the field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a courageous, confident teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew larger, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up like any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, who, according to him, might need some help.
And even the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people who just drive through here will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” Alondra Kenon said on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York we speak fluent financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the massive television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t even notice that they’re in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades, bankers and hedge fund administrators who have the monopoly in New York, they have the worst day of horror work every day since the 1929 stock market crash.
The suppliers are still pushing the metal tea carts along sidewalks with loud rattles and transporting trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still slurred between apartments as human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting on their breakfast bar at food stands on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a day of the week between 4 pm and 7 pm.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all the world’s downfall.
Although I had decided to put my compulsory course on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were already in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists about their way to Macy’s department store, and where new customers open accounts.
Most of the time before me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", stood in line for the same reason as me.
However, unlike me, they had already taken their savings from smaller banks, in places where they commuted from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (similar to a building savings bank), cooperative banks, and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silently bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion bank with assets, went into bankruptcy management and when last Friday New Yorker drove home over the weekend, Wachovia, another $440 billion savings bank, was looking for a saving buyer.
Fearing another collapse, the office and shop workers who were standing in front of me brought their cash to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank that is responsible for most of Wall Street’s rescue purchases.
Normal New Yorkers have acquired a fluent financial Latin in the last few weeks.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese tribal supermarket, with so much familiarity, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and their slender-looking CEO Dick Fuld as if she were blaming a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, who's around the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has dropped off our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my grocery delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking any risk anymore."
Muslim graves disgraced during right-hand slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to represent the organization "Cities Against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police are accusing right-wing extremists of the burial at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at which extreme right-wing parties have made significant gains in the country’s parliamentary elections.
On the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an action organized, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to obscure the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the grave atrocity that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan comes to an end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign and some of their election slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, which won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burqas, and even expressed his aversion to foodstuffs generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which say that the extreme right is the most politically powerful bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Last Thursday, police in Kent were allowed to impose a foreign travel ban after they presented evidence of Glitter’s criminal charges for child sexual abuse to the judges.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Court reported: "On Thursday, September 25, Kent police at Ashford District Court requested permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad's travel abroad to France and Spain by March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the sex offender registry, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a five-year prison sentence.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter’s possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
“In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks.”
"It is the highest concern of the Kent police to protect the residents of Kent and we are working closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn’t feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to request that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character," Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the show.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who do not concentrate and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find a gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look, or the expressiveness of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project <0x60>Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents alternate theatrical performances on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists, from which he was little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of photography of flamenco, <0x60>reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing from day to day', explains the artist and makes it clear that <0x60>flamenco-people' can be <0x60>any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera.
Inspired by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer set out on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands Flamenco: <0x60>music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something, which becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and has been the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata in the near future.
Famous Flamenco personalities including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as a "portrait of the veterans of the sport" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts of the project <0x60>Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me a lot of likes to photograph people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, be it for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or come across people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
The collection of portraits of the Flamenco of today, entitled <0x60>Flamenco-people', is exhibited in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he is writing is ‘a rage’.
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his attendance at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he was dealing with was “a rage” and “everything indicates that he would not have to write the novel.”
“If I were prudent, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel sometime,” he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged, and within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of <0x60>La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won premium of the Hay Festival festival and to whom most attendees gave their voices, is compared to the old edition of <0x60>Our mutual friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had an audience in front of him, who realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, which emerges from 'exceptional pleasure in adventure', from 'joy in reading' and from 'experienced' like to experience his work, and from 'experienced' like to do'.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that there is ‘no way’ to measure and to know whether books change life, ‘but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,’ Vargas Llosa stressed, who claims that it ‘calls on’ the writer’s responsibilities and ‘doesn’t take the writer’s responsibilities apart any more.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bullfighting festivals partly failed.
After the announced bullfighters determined that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the festival was to be concluded in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, the organizer, with the consent of Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was exposed to unstable weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>as and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, most of the audience responded in his second fight with Buh-Calls.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two police officers called on the drivers of the car to stop, and they fled.
It looked like they would not have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police tracked her down and arrested one of the drivers, the man, who is 28 years old, known as A.A.J., as the Basque State Interior Ministry said.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police of the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and drove past the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on.
They decided to stop a car to perform the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police started the chase until after a few kilometers the car stopped at the edge of the strip, and at that moment the drivers got out of the car to flee over a country road into a forest area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later routed to further police departments for precise laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was ‘double’, so that it did not correspond to the license plate indicated in the car papers, which is why additional arrests were made for forgery of official documents.
The city of Ertzaintza police are continuing the investigation to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the confiscated drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J. was taken to a police station for interrogation and will be brought to the detention judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the action of an unknown drug.
A witness had watched her try to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, California traffic police spokesman told People magazine.
The witness told in detail that Locklear “squeezed accelerator after 16:30 and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.”
A little later, the witness, who at first probably hadn’t recognized the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby street and get out of the car.
The witness was the person who alerted the emergency service because she had “fear of living around Locklear’s.”
When the police raid arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street and thus blocked traffic.
“She seemed unorientated, so they took the policemen to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress was shown to be cooperative, excessive drinking was excluded from the first moment. "The first observations of the officials, we believe Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug," the spokeswoman said.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and placed in a local detention center around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the clinic in Arizona, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the principal coordinator of the VL and United Left MP, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Councillor for Youth and Sports at the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
“In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one to take responsibility for this,” Llamazares pointed out the way the party must take against the one who until now sits in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for <0x60>transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva may have started: <0x60>The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has “a strict ethical code for all public offices.”
<0x60>Sangre de mayo': Book of Heroes by Garci
Inspired by <0x60>Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Carci presents in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with approximately 15 million euros investment for the filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to present 'a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the beginning of a long list of actors.
<0x60>Sangre de mayo', with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later shown on the channel Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, great fan of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s literature, assures that thanks to this filming his 'childhood dream' was fulfilled. This is thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the Autonomous Community of Madrid to shoot a commemorative film for the second century celebration on November 2 in Madrid. Especially because the story was based on the <0x60>Episodios' mission.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was made for filming by the Autonomous Community of Madrid, offers Garci, as he added, the "one-off possibility" with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of the "confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been brought back by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand the VII.
However, the Cineast regrets that the financing could not be expected as with <0x60>Alatriste' or <0x60>Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with <0x60>Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in <0x60>Volver a empezar', was involved in his usual way of working: he stood on the stage to the actors with whom one must first rehearse before one begins to film, and for those who had not made a casting, he appeared in <0x60>humiliating' and giving respect to cinema, <0x60>a part of the film director's profession to know what to do, what to do, what to do in the theatre, <0x60>a part of the film director'.
Many actors he encounters in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (one of which he won), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither <0x60>Sangre de mayo', nor <0x60>Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally neither the selected film <0x60>Los gisoles'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“In the beginning you think you’re working for progeny, later you realize that it’s only for flourishing, and now you’re satisfied if you’ve produced another film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of working.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.”
“We are not trying to tell you about her life without preserving her esprit,” said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance foundations helped me a lot in flamenco.
‘The dance of the butterfly’ seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or ‘the dance of the snake’ like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic field," she claims.
The production expects two extraordinary collaborations: Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel in one of her performances, as he did in La puerta abierta; and Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
Matilde plays T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola, a very mature personality.
I'm happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored."
The production also counts on musical composition and the guitarists Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; with the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra J<0xC3><0xBA>arez, he 'receives the role of the diver, the artist'
This work also tells a certain story about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
"I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain era and whose works no one can appreciate today and therefore even less," Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n claims.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 in the theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado' at the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council of Culture to celebrate the <0x60>Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n's Five Annivers Celebration.
Thus <0x60>the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n' is completed with the new edition of this work, with the International Congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the House-Museum of Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition <0x60>Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: <0x60>Aquel chopo de luz', which was now opened in May, is presented in New York's International Congress: <0x60>Aquel chopo de luz', which was now different in May
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of <0x60>Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more famous.
The U.S. can imagine itself badly without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the then prevailing notion of American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic notion and followed her.
Look what it cost him to win the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
He knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
"What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, crying, "my life and my country were the greatest atrocities of his life."
No one was afraid of making himself ridiculous or exaggerating.
As the ‘father’ of cinema and the homeland, he died at a sad moment in which fear of terrorists and the market collapse prevails, in which the depressed self-esteem of Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If there are only a few people to admire in this difficult time without virtue, you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered, like various losses, both gains: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and founded in honor of his son from the first marriage who died of overdose to the own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift to the country where it took a lot of effort to stand up to a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of wonder strikes house high above Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“The greatest of us all has left us,” confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to live the way Paul Newman lived: to maintain high standards of righteousness, to lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there is someone who is trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was faithful to, although there were certainly many ways of not being there.
“Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?” he often joked himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he was so proud of none as of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympics, the streets in Madrid are deficient.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say that it is not true!
It was described as a perfect road, and in my judgment, it was the worst road with everything there was.
Of course, that is a lot of nonsense, if you would consider the evaluation and I could check it, this clearly would not have happened.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket picking that allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem bad to me, either, but if they already let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams).
Well, I don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that is to go there only because of that) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size <0x60>S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like this are a small thing compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once been successful, but getting them back would be more difficult.
In addition, it looked like rain in these 40 minutes, so it came to the temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me will not even appear at the classification in time because of this chip I got, I can already imagine that the output was stamped incorrectly.
Of course, if I was asked about a perfect road, I would never think of that road.
So I think we will long dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympics
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the Emerging Technology Conference, hosted by MIT, Microsoft unveiled the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without a lot of intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move around the company’s campus).
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this ‘receptionist’ can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also classify the attendees into the groups after the discussions.
In the presentation video, ‘the receptionist’ notices a third person, but she understands that this person does not belong to the group that is talking to her, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will be listening soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and won’t have as many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary things, instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a statement considering that Microsoft added one or the other feature and <0x60>Extras' in Windows versions.
Change of direction is worth it
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many have pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law something.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time browsing than in the 'windows' area.
What is half the use of existing applications for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without a doubt, and I'll give you a small example of that.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the automatic soft drink machine: <0x60>Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google for research on the net.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took it on in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in <0x60>Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in <0x60>The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to list the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavyweights in a travelling circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, surpasses all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. Legend has it that the name creation is associated with sport and originated from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
<0x60>La Marcel' stands out because of its outstanding cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (nearly recognizable), which these T-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of <0x60>tanks'.
They also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Pants, T-Shirts with Stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very unfortunate to use them as underwear.
They are very charming.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz is petite, but full of joie de vivre.
Currently, the brothers Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For M<0xC3><0xB3>nica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who maintain their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, where she moved and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I attended the presentation of the second edition of <0x60>Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intense working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinemas of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dress like they are, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, but after all, everything meets in one and these areas have many similarities.
Ever since I was little, I’ve been thrilled with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother’s place to wander around in my aunt’s wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers so much like having our own style in class and at the rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I feel better than ever, as a 30-year-old, I feel good.
I think the woman gets ripe, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I’ve done the things I’ve wanted to do since I was little and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
I have known for a long time that I am going to be a mother because my body demands that and I also want to be a young mother; I will not miss that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
I will convey great feelings of happiness to my child and educate him with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you participated in and filmed last year.
That’s exactly what it is and I want it to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that <0x60>La <0xC3><0xBA>ltima hora' and <0x60>En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the walk with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, simply called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for her organization’s charity event, Women for a Better World, and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our collection have been auctioned for Mango to raise the money for Naomi’s NGO.
People don’t know Naomi’s good heart.
A lot of things are being told about her, and I, as the one who knows her, would tell you that she's not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
Drivers who may become relapsed due to the alcohol level will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol levels, installs this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car in the drunken state. If he is alcoholic, the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Prosecutor General, which, according to them, is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, which is why he gets a course for the re-education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the Prosecutor General’s Office, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were reported to be driving under the influence of alcohol more than once were back at the wheel.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents car start when the driver has taken alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of rule violations as early as the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behavior before it becomes a crime.
And to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the usual way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is required, which is necessary for the law enforcement process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, in no store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without ‘peep-toes’
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez de México DF airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force, travelled with the Prince and Princess of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple that got off the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the prince and the princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, because you can't take people at the airport at this time you're from here or something
No, she's the Spaniard, but she lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh so, very good
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport’s hangar and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 Navy soldiers who give honorary salves.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', perhaps was told that a thunderstorm in DF was expected.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, where the official sequence is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for them, who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium fashion and there was probably no substantially outstanding fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition <0x60>el B<0xC3><0xB3>ton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international promotion of young fashion talents.
This will be awarded with a cash prize of 300,000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the Mango store window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest store is located in London.
So many events have happened that are associated with thanking fashion designer Valentino for his jury presidency in the competition, all ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart broken by the pain of his brother’s recent death, ripped apart. He put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some ELAH jewelry that was stunning. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and owner of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without jackets, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, has rushed to the shop and had a pants and a shirt on which she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got in a state of excitement, reminiscent of the old times, took a grannie,
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own bedspreads and towels) at the Internacional Hotel in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council Against Stress
There is not a thousand, but one more way to forget chaotic our fast-paced everyday life.
And even if there are a few, they are all collected in a book that tells us how to relax. The book comes to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse appears the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that lead to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of how to disconnect from the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than up to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the complete list of options adapted to the taste and time of each one.
The work against the stress is called <0x60>1001 possibilities to relax' and so the calm that the book conveys comes to the bookstores of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this handbook disproves such faith.
In addition, the methods offered are how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes suggested that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children talk at night
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best, you will be frightened, but in reality, that has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, such as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no reason for this appearance.
Often, relationships with other phenomena in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stress situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in single words, whispers or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the utterance is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult with a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes anxiety and arises in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, be it it, it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with the sleep apnea or with the stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Do not try to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV shows that are terrible and a little too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
When talking occurs during sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day it will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Even though the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if it shows itself frightened after a pair of appearances, it is recommended to get advice or find out what reason the child is afraid of.
When they understand what it says (which isn’t so common), the child doesn’t put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information out.
So you will not be able to achieve anything because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says so, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhäuser... finally
After a long period of thirst, Illhäusern is finally back on track for success on the field.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks gained numerous goals and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot was just past the corner, Illhäusern was supposed to dominate the game with ease, and it was alternately possible first Fonderflick with a distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot to challenge the defence of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, leaving only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive with first two goals won by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately thereafter with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, who stood just right to take back a ball that had been resisted by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the Illhäusian goal scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, which forced his teammates to continue playing in numbers inferior.
Denmark, however, did not know how to take advantage of this and did not face any major problems to an ill-Haïsian elf, who retreated only a little to “compact” their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
Given the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to meet in the port of Guilvinec in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him ‘with a constructive spirit’, and hoped that he would come up with ‘concrete proposals’.
The President’s visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee established by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in diesel prices, which has reached a record value of an average of over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, “the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their businesses become competitive again, and to ensure the working conditions and pay of seafarers.”
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
Tuesday morning they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvado, which caused congestion of nearly ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le did not stop.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not sail out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting on Wednesday in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec Crisis Committee must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
“The strike will continue because the fishermen will not give in at any point and they do not want to go to Paris,” said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel, the liter currently costs about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from Butch Cassidy and the Kid died at the age of 83 as a result of cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes said goodbye to the movie legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the impending recession, to be a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, is keeping its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado reiterated.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider distributing more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times’ Sunday issue, insurer American International Group, which was financially backed by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering handing over more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion that was set aside for it.
AIG is ready to drive the sale of most of its businesses, beyond its international life insurance and retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
Assets that AIG may be separating from include its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, the FT continues.
With regard to these sales, no final decision was made, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as soon as possible in order to repay the loans over 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve, also at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the Session Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday after the Chamber of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historic fall in prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As far as points are concerned, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final shooting figures, the Nasdag index, mainly technology-related, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Following the unexpected rejection by the Chamber of Deputies of the plan to save the banks, which would again allow some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been slammed at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes in favour and 205 in favour, MEPs refused to grant finance secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“Here is a bad picture circulating that presents Congress as incapable of adopting a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come "too late."
“If the project is actually doomed to failure, it will quickly be up to the Fed and other central banks to get to grips with the crisis, which would limit credit conditions even more,” warned Brian Bethune, economics chief at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, emphasizing the feeling of extreme urgency even more, that “every day that passes brings with it the ruin of a financial company” in the United States.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the U.S. authorities planned to buy Wachovia’s banking operations from its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” added the analyst at FTN Financial.
The market for basic supplies has grown sharply.
Revenues from the Treasury within ten years fell Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner after points in first television duel
The first debate between the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another one to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in the election of both Republicans and Democrats in this television duel, which was to be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, though quite handsome, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to stop his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll was published on Saturday, according to which Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
Among the still undecided voters, that is, those that matter now, Obama emerged as the winner from the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to put his undeniable foreign policy experience at the forefront, clearly underlining his opponent's "naiveness" with regard to these questions, which were the focus of this first television duel.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he stressed several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to become president,” he added.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican election commercials since yesterday.
Obama said he represents the future.
He expressed himself in a short and precise manner, without letting himself be out of the frame.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and renew the image the world has of the United States.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, Obama already,” a Democratic poller said this weekend, accusing Republicans of not capturing the full extent of the crisis that is weighing on the ‘American off the street.’
“During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in a flooding rain at an election event in North Carolina.
He didn’t even mention the words “medium” or “workers.” The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss, a clear advantage.
“Next week could be a crucial turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration member, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
After once again stressing that he would probably even manage to lower taxes on 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations in Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, had top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully evaded the questions raised about the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (470 billion euros), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular among the people.
“Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?”
Young people and oppositionists demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital, in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polling stations in the Minsk marketplace to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: “The dictator should resign.”
Some admit that they did not vote at all: ‘What good is it if they do with my voice what they want,’ says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-issuing of visas to 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the glaring of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were assessed as clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
“We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting,” said Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it matters who counts the votes, and for us that is the executive.
When opposition MPs move into parliament, it is because they were appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.”
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because "the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the election process, does not recognize the election as valid.
She stresses that the voter turnout numbers seem too high, and that the expansion of the voter turnout in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election has taken place?” asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to conform to the ideas of the government.”
The silence of the night falls again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Conversation - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood donation service during the 1980s were contaminated with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994, aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and developing guidelines to prevent another catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces set up a committee at the time whose goal was to develop a new system for the management of canned blood in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this order.
According to reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is in charge of Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
“In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the Quebec blood canning system, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was daunting.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood cans and by working in this field over the following years, we have regained public confidence," she says, before proudly stressing that by early 2008, nearly 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary maintains that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since its inception in 1998, tells us.
“And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we cited one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is evident in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago it was proved without any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied makes sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which make it possible to detect the presence of the virus directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST allowed to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time the person became infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and you could not recognize it, has been significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that you would have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone gets infected with HIV.
As Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cans each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case of HIV to occur via a blood can.
I believe that you can feel comfortable these days when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore health," says the director of Hema-Quebec.
<0x60>Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogens can enter the system.
Only last year did the Chikungunya virus appear on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We have to monitor continuously," continues Dr. Décary, before emphasizing that Hema-Quebec must provide adequate care in addition to safe care.
“The demand is increasing because the population is ageing.
Because the treatments for fighting cancer are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which on average only includes 3% of Quebec's blood donors.
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because, for example, they have AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for a year.
With these 3%, we manage to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and make them become regular donors.
“Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood canned but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being intervened at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec's only public umbilical cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood in stem cells, which can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
<0x60>A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousandth cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand annually.
“We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood reduction as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced they don’t have access to it, because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinals
Montreal’s impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second quarter-final match at Saputo Stadium, where the total goal ratio counted, qualified for the semi-finals of the first league of the USL.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal both for one side and for the other side, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the Montreal Formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let’s remember that the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact won the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle, a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to make up for a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps nevertheless moved into the semi-finals with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be determined today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The Canadian team's number 1 trio is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a stormfire, resulting in a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two assists and Kovalev converted a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the entire shooting.
"I'm not ready, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel good.'
"He's been fixating too much on it in the first half," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause."
Charest relies on the north
The Prime Minister does not preclude elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today’s sub-election.
“Shifting the course of our last big border in the north”: This is the long-term goal Jean Charest presented yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following entirely the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, Quebec viewed in <0x60>Google Maps', maps, etc.
Big funds like during the parliamentary term.
The Prime Minister, by the way, refused to rule out holding the elections this autumn, even though he said his calendar was very full.
The ‘Plan Nord’ is the fourth element of a ‘vision’ that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a ‘new economic area’ that provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has recently been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speeches, the opening of the North – the northern area at 49th latitude – has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was “a jewel with enormous potential,” but did not mention a date, investment sums, or exact priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most some prospects of what could be done more: especially on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charest’s enumeration, the North has “nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds.”
This <0x60>area twice as big as France' <0x60>is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just near us, it's within us," he stressed, as to clearly show that he is seeking to realize a national founder's dream.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line at which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he explained, speaking about the Northwest Passage, which will be navigable throughout the year due to the melting of ice.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a very important duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the natives, and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would handle them very carefully, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist MP of Ungava), have already started discussions with some thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) takes an important place, has started the work.
The prime minister does not exclude a large assembly, ‘not necessarily a summit’, but an opportunity in which ‘one will create a common vision’.
The development of the North will also take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be ‘discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly’, he promised.
Jean Charest described this ‘vision’ as a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development opportunities.
Incidentally, this was one of the themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the adopted decisions is to rename the Beauharnois power plant to Adélard-Godbout dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
To the press, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the ‘Roads to the North’ programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr Charest stresses that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
"That remains among us, but I intend to be with him," he entrusted to his party members, which provoked in those applause storms.
The prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has indeed not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible to him by law.
He stresses that his schedule is full, however, mainly because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially of “constitutional goals”, which were readily adopted: The PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the “specialty of Quebec” in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications, and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were taken up with skepticism.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has revived the policy for the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, did not use it.
If she had done so, “we would be much further today,” Ms Marois, along with her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is held today), judged Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ has voiced support for the government’s adoption of a North Plan.
“But what we want is that this will not only be a big show,” said party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justice' minister (what irony) in Harper's cabinet, was the one who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration for covering her with shame, says as much about the people around the prime minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not brought home its compatriot captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things that were being accused of him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and makes a child soldier go wild under inhuman conditions.
The only one who is condescending to a judicial parody to assess the defendant’s guilt.
Let us remember that especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: she cares very little that a young adult will surely be mentally broken after so many years of torment.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing an insidious circumcision here of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper is constantly carrying in front of us like a flag, and that sounds so insignificant from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: one can arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, according to the opinion of a head of government who is only supported by the minority to this day (may he be entirely a minority after October 14th...).
Many voters believe they can find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has abandoned what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this abandonment, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world’s largest gold mining company was seeking a libel lawsuit over six million against three authors and a small, mediocre publishing house, with the aim of opening a ‘public transparent debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge about the truth, especially not in the case of libel lawsuits, but about the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defenses and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the goldmine’s almost inexhaustible pockets.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is, by the way, often to ruin the defenders in order to enforce a consensual regulation that silences the other side and also deter anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually carried out through the exchange of ideas and not through bats.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened up a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent audit teams that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a handshake.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the opinions of this public?
Apparently, in the world of the Vice-President, this word encompasses only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand — or doesn’t want to understand — is that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, is doing so primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada in which it demands that they stop using this term...).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and truth-finding that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It totally denies the right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to deal with debates and disagreements and how to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, unlike what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures that restrict these types of unjustified lawsuits.
Wall Street bailout: Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months still needs to be adopted by the two congressional chambers.
The main contents are: better control of MEPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new injunctions to limit the number of houses imprisoned due to payment arrears, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies.
American Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,” Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said in a statement.
"Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street price crisis," she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t, the trauma, chaos, and unrest in Americans’ daily lives will be enormous,” said Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, out of fear of the impact that another failure would have had on the sentiment of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who did not participate in the negotiations until late, were more likely to be proponents of the agreement, without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the need to hit them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama insisted on the addition of certain injunctions to the agreement, especially those to allow owners to keep their homes, and those that affect the salaries of the senior executives of the state-saved companies.
“If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain individuals, this is not something to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on American television channels.
When asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: “I’d like to know the details first, but I hope so.
The principles I have read [show] that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to progress.
The option of doing nothing at all is simply unacceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at using the money of taxpayers.
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage loans (subprime) before it expanded to further forms of more common bonds (PCAA), and eventually resulted in a freezing of financial strength and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed the first attempt to reach an agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain “toxic” assets of the societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, it is believed to escape the impasse.
To round off the viewpoints for everyone in Congress, a decree has also been added that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes in order to recover its capital used.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington will receive shares in the supported companies, which will yield dividends in the event of profits, and which it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the attachment proceedings concerning the apartments bound by the real estate loans covered by this plan, and also to set deadlines for repayment and compensation paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, more votes were raised yesterday against this plan, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber’s Finance Commission, told his voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists in asking the taxpayers to cash in.”
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called the “Caucus of Skeptics,” presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to be put under pressure and carefully consider which path to take,” he said.
At the same time, we in Europe once again got proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which has been in great trouble since it lost €2 billion ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to the high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
“This is not a lost money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
To compensate, we have a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announcing themselves.”
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bradford and Bringley, including over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the British bank’s branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has had to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensibility and an obvious talent have also kept him away from a power position that gives birth to the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great endurance runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from the consequences of lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the golden years he has been.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on the screen for a long time, more careful in his spectacle, certainly also fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the blast of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often results in wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream was to emerge.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
For in him, an entire country that was in love with the self-made man was reflected in the fighters who were wounded in the Pacific War in battle, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theatre, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who finished second in Mans's 1979 24-hour race, and also a sex symbol, although he had lived in a flagship relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and overly sensitive star, whose mystery will never be solved completely, disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman moved the cinema lovers to Taumel this weekend, while all his big roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change passes with him.
The charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Tin Roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958, come to mind.
A much shorter past memory (1990) is awakened to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all of her promises.
There have been so many Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, re-recorded after his death and made the Newman popular in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the superb The Sting (The Clou), who was awarded the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through time, that was it.
Still him.
In his CV, epochs unite.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a last role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends who retired from the film world early enough, Newman was supposed to stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, its fortunes, its splendor, and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to ‘underplaying’ when he judged his all-too-expressive achievements.
The métier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles only flew this way for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, fissures or despair, with whose perfect portrayal he reflected his gliding and revolt.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibility.
His 1968 Rachel, Rachel (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) starring his wife Joanne Woodward, drew a subtle portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott due to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness to him.
During the flood of honors that went on over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, “His presence has improved my life and this country.”
Generousness and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the drift of Hollywood, is now going to die.
We probably often saw him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this was quite tasteless, although we still found it funny at first.
Nevertheless, the profits from his sales went to his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the point of shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: “Your father was always and until the very end incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us, it was an honor to be able to pursue the lives of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced into the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
Negotiations in the criminal trial against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos and his accomplices begin on 8 October.
In particular, the defendants are accused of involvement in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts - including document falsification.
According to the prosecutor's office, the funds gained from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often covered by counterfeit invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to have been partly transferred to the cash registers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the private cash registers of individuals.
As the investigative authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender money was received, and the associations were also said to have not fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were faked.
The billing blocks were bought at the market of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was decided on that round trip north of Lake Balaton, to which Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados was sent by J<0xC3><0xA1>nos surcharge.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lados should find guesthouses and restaurants.
He requested bills of consumption in order to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the self-government of Budapest based on these templates.
These bills are said to have been mostly manipulated by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice, Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, with the latter, according to our information, being responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer shop.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the 90-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, also revealed serious errors in form and content.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed, according to the bill.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was apparently set no limits when it came to Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company in whose accounting documents the customers Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> did not even appear, according to the prosecution.
As managing director Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that these were fake documents when documents were presented to him by the prosecutor’s office during an interview.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly placed on the stamp".
And furthermore, apart from form defects, the fact that the company is said to have accommodated a hundred people was also wrong, after they had a total of eleven rooms that could not possibly accommodate so many people.
The bill also stated that the restaurant had not been in operation for a long time.
The embittered counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted only offers travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary travel on the cash payment invoice, which also contradicted the company’s accounting practice.
In addition, as it became known in the course of the investigation, they also cited VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, since the company only charges 15 percent VAT instead of 25, in addition, only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the counterfeit documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made to the "invoicing agents" was that in a case they had indicated "goods transport" as a service rendered, although this is not offered by the company specializing in investment consulting, the prosecutor said.
Other form errors - incorrect invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, as well as to XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeit.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> sports camp, whose managing directors asserted that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" has been made to the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za: This society was in dissolution at the time (2001) when the group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyesület is said to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated not to have issued the invoices himself.
Deliberately Fake
The other group of accountants are individuals who were well aware that they would have to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, the foundation Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny has issued invoices for the foundation Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, amounting to about HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the CEO of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with contract and co.: In 2003, the GmbH was to provide the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vorösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület associations with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which were not paid.
However, there was also no payment transaction, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issuance, which the parties concerned have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., a Budapest-based but unrecognizable fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components in the period from October to December 2005 with a total value of about 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, the cash investment firm from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov confessed during the investigation to have issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and to have collected their own equivalents.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian bricklayers on Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov’s express wish.
In truth, however, none of these companies were active, which was due to a lack of orders, according to the defendant.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was tasked with preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>.
Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices totaling HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov may have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT each.
Kubatov even allegedly abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Szövetség a Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but have used these amounts for their own purposes.
To cover this up, they submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
Incidentally, these invoices were secured during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some defendants are now expecting a confession about the procedure of counterfeiting, as already filed before the public prosecutor’s office.
It could be a sensation if the main defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>nos decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already pledged several times to report extensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the reparation of the bulk of the damage incurred of HUF 50 million, and whether the surcharge in return is willing to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that supplement now plays the "injured" after his requests for mitigation of the detention and house arrest had come to deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage to economic crimes and have not remunerated them are free, or at least under house arrest, this possibility is denied by surcharge.
The Psychology of Exceeding – or Why We Are Ready to Pay More
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue what is being filed.
Neurologists and business researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in "Science" magazine, people don't want to give up in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was supposed to play lotto while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the opponent's overriding plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
To underpin their thesis, the economists in the research group have also done research to track the money.
In this case, three groups should bid against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised $15 reward in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was merely that the emphasis was on winning one, while the other was on losing.
As evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "against losing" group were willing to make higher bets than those in the control or the "profit" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have so far justified the behaviours observed at auctions only with the joy of winning or avoiding risks.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation ready,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated to be one hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in the case of hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example through contaminated food or water), in the case of hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretions or saliva).
Travelers are advised to vaccinate against viruses A and B, but there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B-induced, far more severe diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten people infected is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognised in good time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby eliminating the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first held by patient representatives worldwide in 2004.
The aim of the action is to increase awareness of these chronic liver inflammations caused by viruses, their development and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research shows, religious belief acts like a kind of “pain drug” that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: it was investigated to what extent faith in God affects the pain sensation of humans, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Using brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which released the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke some sort of religious trance among the faithful, while selecting da Vinci’s image, because it was hardly distinguished from the other painting and felt as reassuring.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during this time, while watching either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that when they saw the Mother of God, they felt “safe” as if they were “cared for” and felt “peace and tranquillity.”
While viewing the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be produced with other strong-acting images by the atheists, one would only have to find the appropriate photo.
"We would have to find a picture that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
The Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practicing faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases," Wright said.
After these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can rightly claim that she can be found in people’s pockets as well as above her head in the sky: she knows where people spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what moves her.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics who are plagued by Orwell’s horror visions, he lets them align: these would just overlook the essentials of the Web 2.0.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt said Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal of “ordering all the information in this world.”
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of information gathering.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so, as they do not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms will be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which search was made and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and later access it, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is also based on the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of data abuse - "When you look at what I do" - some show concern about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company that is fearsome, and less the feeling of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the reluctance to oppose the power that is encountered by many internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an event, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected from the community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the pedophilia.
However, users concerned about personal rights were still able to breathe in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully sued the FBI in court: According to this, Google can still be forced to disclose information to the FBI on a secret request in the future with no point of the constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the issuance of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, however, the list of individual users or their web and search terms list was withheld retroactively for two months.)
Thus, Google’s image remains controversial: those who dislike to disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google services scourge the company with the indignation due to the conservative companies.
Meanwhile, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that unlike Microsoft, Google does not require any identification codes for its users, and provides its services free of charge, so an open, constantly updated source code and program package appear to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet – a relationship that has come to the fore especially in recent years thanks to the term “Web 2.0”.
"Web 2.0" is about nothing more than collaboration, i.e., users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions vary individually, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teenager can simultaneously manage their profile on multiple community portals – from Facebook to Xanga, connect it through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries that are geoested on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases proves: looking at last night’s party photos, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has been amused, or the employee is fired, because in his blog he blows up his anger about corporate governance all too honestly – one thing is certain: the term “privacy” has now been completely reinterpreted.
Who leads an online life is what he reveals of himself - for example, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, can gladly do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but intentionally leaves no trace.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but Google’s online applications, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can also be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
Public opinion, however, waits for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense’s advertising space threatens the revenue of advertising agencies, and the ever-faster-introduced services are shaping the minds of not only Microsoft, but also other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing opposites: for example, the Group management has completely rejected a protest of employees after the fees of the company’s own kindergarten were doubled, in addition, the management thought that the multiple meals of the employees would be too costly, but all this seems to be against the fact that in 2006 Google was in favour of the Chinese government even to the knees.
The company’s internal regulation is that no new service will be advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could again significantly recur: while some believe that Google’s book and magazine scanning or archiving project is now taking on the extent that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are completely relied on the creation of a health profile because of the system.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database already provides the next generation of sci-fi authors with the substance - for example, "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian way a future in which a person becomes terrifyingly close thanks to Google-related data.
Two teens help <0xC3><0x93>zd's double-killer to eradicate traces
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, police have now interrogated two young people suspected of having helped remove the tracks, the spokesman for the Borsod police commissioner said on Tuesday.
The young people were decent, and they are currently being charged with the aid.
According to the MTI news agency, it is two girls who defend themselves on free foot.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately killing several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a 53-year-old a larger amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to pay off his debts, so he lured his creditor to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act long-handedly - this also proves the fact that he has committed the murders with a gun hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Announces Buying Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, have been offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the one hundred percent purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolevski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer the Poles had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports of the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offer of the Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to be 5-10 billion kroner.
According to shareholder agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the growing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers spoke on Tuesday of the “second 11 September”.
We owe the global financial catastrophe to the American president, for example, "La Repubblica" - the president had not even been able to get his own party for the bill behind him, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “second 9/11.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is in danger of collapsing more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not have any political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva "day indicator".
Even though some states could provide their faltering financial institutions with bailout packages, and save the banks from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are failing, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long run, EU member states would have to jump over their shadow and centralize control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid to weakening financial institutions, the Viennese Der Standard recalls. Moreover, the newspaper continues, the concerns are becoming more and more realistic that after the Americans, the European taxpayers now also have to reach a little deeper in their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis, which is now sweeping like a tsunami over the old continents.
The “saviors” would not have to “sweep” immediately with several hundred billion euros, but it would be advisable to record, in which case it would be reasonable to touch the money of the taxpayers in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new technologies for accident prevention if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was unveiled in which Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in creating new accident-preventing systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C car-driven biomimetic system, a mini car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of a laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180 degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates its distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the auto robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tires at the appropriate angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
“If it weren’t, the robot could not react fast enough to avoid the obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield – a layer within which accidents are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they dodge other bees.
And this has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, the evasion can not take place up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the manoeuvrability of the tires.
While the bees here have endless possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the robot to rotate, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained, it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It does not have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction based on previous manoeuvres, so that it constantly takes only a handful of KB of memory.
It does not require gigabyte and megabyte heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which Nissan believes will be in production in the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately steering the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the destination.
A name for the sinner child
Now, the written version of the $700 billion bailout bill is available, which will be applied in several stages and aims to purchase the bad loans from banks.
In the first round, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time on the East Coast, Congressmen have gone through after several days of debates to reach an agreement on the $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
“We have made substantial progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying that the agreement should only be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout package supported both presidential candidates – Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: “The program will be effective and efficient, but we need to do even more. According to Pelosi, this was not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing the rudder of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high-altitude flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the bill for stabilizing the economy of 2008, then it will be the Senate’s turn.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
“We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
However, the program deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of lazy, credited securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion amount will be spent, with $250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the causa on Monday. This sum will be spent on the purchase of credited bad securities, and the president will decide on the remaining $100 billion.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another congressional decision.
Under the terms of the law, the Treasury can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-charged securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the Ministry’s responsible persons, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Treasury guarantees the worrying funds, and the companies pay the expected damages corresponding fees.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the funds needed to provide up to $700 billion as an emergency aid to the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now relying on state aid can expect their clearances, which are called “golden handshake” in the overseas snake, to be cut by the government.
A cut in salaries will only occur in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the ministry purchases in the context of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the retired head of the bank is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will aggressively engage to ensure that manager salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only apply to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank are better off.
The bill stipulates that, over the next five years, the president will have to make a proposal to Congress on how taxpayers can get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect of us, the plan doesn’t protect taxpayers’ money at all, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were driven by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008, down 3.9% from the previous year’s prices.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices rose only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Also, the selling prices of the manufacturing industry increased only slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily for bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, for shoes the prices went up by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and production (1.6%).
A price decline was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and slightly in wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in papermaking, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the major domestic markets of the industry, such as the electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry year-on-year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4%).
In the metal-processing sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11%.
A price decline was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The level of inflation in the other processing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
In the domestic market, the highest price increase was recorded in the asset sector in August (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and further processing sectors they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest increase in prices in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sector (16.8 percent) compared to the 2007 period.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent and a price reduction of 1.4 percent were noted for investment goods.
Industry export prices measured in Forint increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decline of 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, the dollar by 7.1 percent, and compared with the price of August 2007, it grew by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, with the dollar even by 15.9 percent.
No more visas to the United States in 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances for the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force by 12 January, the Foreign Minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced overseas in time."
She also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington from today.
She meets Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also conducts talks with Democrat Barack Obama's foreign policy advisers and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, have pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians calling for the Treasury Minister’s resignation.
Congress and government representatives announced after days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they have reached an agreement on the banking bailout package.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain’s High, which brought him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was melted down at the same time.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly adopt the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the plan also includes those consumer protection passages that he supported.
"We need to act responsibly now - your jobs, your savings, whole industries, and the stability of the entire economy are under threat," he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain’s economic visions “obsolete.”
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We’ll all be hard to pine to this, but doing nothing is definitely not an alternative.”
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribes the creation of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of clearances for top managers – something he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within the camp became more confident - so "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavarian Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian socials have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The break in the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as is the problem for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but something has come to an end on Sunday, which, however, already occurred pretty exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, falling below the Fifty Percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. still in the much cited Stoiber era.
The modernization, which is consistently carried out by the CSU in the federal state, has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time they were greatly underestimated, but the secularization, the educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria on the loyalty of the CSU voters could not remain without effects.
Modernization is always accompanied by an increase in options, and that has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and idiosyncratic.
It is striking that in recent weeks, the classical citizen groups expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school diploma as well as a university degree.
Here, the CSU’s support dropped to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders restrained in coalition issues" article on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it’s all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders were barely allowed to look into their cards.
SPÖ CEO Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very well possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP as vice-chancellor.
As he said, voters had voted off the Bowl-Molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer, however, reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tries to interfere in internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed in-house by the ÖVP.
BZÖ CEO Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, hosted by the EU Presidency of the Council of France, has begun.
In her speech to the plenary, Fidesz MEP L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka drew particular attention to the segregation of education, as it is one of the most serious violations of law that Roma children face, and it is also the biggest obstacle to their need to apply.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to Fidesz’s press office, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be forced out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no middle school education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher education degree".
Furthermore, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka stressed that education is a fundamental human right that would have a key role to play in asserting other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the MEPs' opinion, it is important that these connections become aware of the widest possible circle - Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and turnover taxes, they contribute to national spending.
"As EU citizens, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated education must be stopped" - says L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
As the MEP explained, a common, targeted and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the desegregation process in the education sector, and to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are adhered to correctly.
"We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
Since last year’s Congress in Berlin, the summit has been organized annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the goals of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European as well as national level, in the sense of the “European Year of Equal Opportunities”.
CSU: Grace on Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the electoral debacle, no heads are rolling for the time being, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17% loss of votes will be decided on the last weekend of October at the Extraordinary Party Congress.
The much scolded duo, however, already made it clear that it does not want to stick on their armchairs.
They want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career peak - the Christian-Social Union still reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they could only secure 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU was the sole governing body in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
The Conservatives remain the determining force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the internal party restructurings, the potential successor Huber, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer is also included in the exploration team, which conducts exploratory talks with the liberal FDP or the right-wing "Free Voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list of "free voters" those Gabriele Pauli enter the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duo first exploited, then mercilessly serve the purposeful politician.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings out of the background, will be given an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called 28 September the "bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion, the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
Should the CSU, which also contributed a lot to the success at the national level in 2005, not be put back on its feet with a joint force act, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again after the federal elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the CSU’s loss of territory will not have a negative impact on the big coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition has made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegalities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature of the 10-million-inhabitant state has been without opposition for decades, the opposition party, which was assembled under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections, seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who would renew his presidential mandate in the impure elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "for the fourth time" renew the presidential mandate in the parliament.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically dependent on Russia’s rising prices of natural gas imports. Loans have even been borrowed to alleviate price increases, and the country has also agreed to sell the Beltransgas, the owner of the country’s gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the context of the opposition’s expectations, it was therefore hoped that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU as a political anti-democrat.
The OECD election evaluation report provided a temporary relaxation, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD’s quick report on Monday criticized the campaign – according to which oppositionists are not likely to appear in the press – and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is ready for even smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federative state on paper, has considered the two territories to be independent for a month.
“We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Milinkevich said.
In the opinion of the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one opposition member into parliament".
The opposition does not plan to protest in the light of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have to deal with many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting stones in our way when it comes to distribution, but I still see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones," Milinkevich said in an allusion that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose sole merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" reminded of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
In contrast to opposition politicians, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the Community of Independent States mission, told the Ria Novosti news agency: "People believe the actions, not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From today, the measure will come into force against those smart people who first stamp and then drink coffee during working hours.
The new "Anti-Foul Fur Act" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
"Sliding doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," Brunetta said.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism,” Brunetta stresses once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the installation ends in all the buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: “The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value.”
There was no resistance on the part of officials, the secretary general assured: "This process was supported by everyone, cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is no more breakfast during working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
In Rome, the minister announced that "within three months, the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 more people are present at work each year."
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"their wage dynamisms - according to the minister - have been twice as large as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined forces to counteract the Brunetta decree as part of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiled with figures on lower absenteeism at work - the consumer headquarters writes - the people of the 'working lazy' are growing uninterrupted.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public service officials have come together to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the obligatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day 2,500 accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention in the workplace is," the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expressed his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to aid the families of victims and to raising awareness of public opinion".
"An outrageous "Basta" has risen up on this; understandable in tragedies that, measured by their magnitude, trigger some vortexes in the media and public sympathy, but everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in school contexts by young people who feed on the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to divert it from its social seriousness.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has stressed "how the phenomenon of labour-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seems to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this 'positive tendency' to mean less attention. That's what ultimately causes the tragedy."
"How to believe that you basically do too little to counteract the phenomenon of accidents, and you can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are starting at school.”
"A further effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and raising awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency is in demand.”
Mercandelli also spoke about "the progressive deterioration of protection for victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is, therefore, to give back to the worker a guarantee on insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or random donations decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 Player Under Charge: Risk of Hearing Damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the EU’s Csrseri (scientific committee on current and recently identified health risks) in a report published today in Brussels.
“It becomes clear from the report that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years per week for more than an hour per day risk the permanent loss of their hearing.”
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at high volumes will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," said Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - as the EU says - show a clear risk that urges rapid action.
What really matters is sensitizing consumers and making this information a common good.
Given these scientific findings, we need to re-evaluate the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
"The scientists - the EU communication concludes - confirm that they are rightly concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other EU Members and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices ".
At the moment, there is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could result from excessive noise exposure.
These damages can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if users of portable music devices only listen to loud music for five hours a week (less than 89 decibels), so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This concerns 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the European Union.
Roma, Alemanno launch "Commission for the future of the capital"
We'll start today, in March it's over, in June we'll take stock.
This is the course set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which the Commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - emphasizes Alemanno. "It will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the city council and the municipal council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
Its task will end in March and the Commission will dissolve again, as such a project must have a time-determined endpoint.
In June, the mayor announces, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
If you question the competence of the Commission, because it lacks its opinion of liability, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then their contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in mind, in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
"This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will make us think, it will employ the best minds of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetical nor static to allow our city a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to make a joint step into the future."
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself to the current municipal borders, but will look much further," not only in terms of Rome's role as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician, much to be considered independent, has written: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the U.S. economy and maintained ties with the opposing Islam (and still does so today as a private person).
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
Actually, these attacks don’t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: Only in the electoral booth will we know who the real American patriot will give his vote to.
This is where a U.S. mentality emerges, which was kept hidden until the last time.
“Say whatever you want, then we’ll decide who we’re going to make our creep for, whether it’s for Obama or for McCain.”
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains Bush’s weak point for the majority.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: you can already feel the cuts in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nonetheless, they did not really express concern about the general credibility of the information relating to those responsible.
You don’t feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the cuts that hit the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to assemble the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking substantially.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fulfills the American journalist.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors believe journalism is on the wrong track at a national level.
In the local area, executives are even up to 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are paving their way to the Internet, which many consider to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "they bring something good to journalism."
The biggest crack in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters working for them.
56% of editors at national level are confident that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work."
Managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
For journalists, that’s 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", ed.) is always a current topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, such as the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and internet operators, employers like them offer and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editor-in-chief often gets very high wages, while the editor can sometimes only get 10000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As for the holiday, the thing becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become “sick” over the course of the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUSTICE IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the real estate agent’s request to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola will be investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecutor’s office had spoken out) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence indicting him.
The elite are in danger.
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago, when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House’s $700 billion savings package: a large proportion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times issue, which reports on how the crisis is in the process of dividing the Republican Party, which is increasingly dividing into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always favored state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are hostile to “those in Washington” and the financial world, and especially win in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the Party owes its ascension in particular to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond these will be affected by them.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-feared events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the wealth of private households residing in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: namely how to behave towards the families affected, which also represent an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis therefore appears economically global, while politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism thus seems to have fallen apart and lost its right to speak: the clear proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its dividing into various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects to intervene in their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the United States is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign aid.
In addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two conditions that are not to be overvalued – under certain circumstances – to which otherwise no international organization and no market will probably be able to resort in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance recently associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, right now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered into a networked total realm, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, the intangible, that we must at once determine how our future will increasingly depend on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
While these can all be transported from one place to the other in the world, they are still connected to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who possesses such a territory is advantageous to another who lives in a cropless, waterless or oil-free territory.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short introduction.
Whoever says territory, who says government, who says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to generate two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deep-reaching and, in a sense, disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, all aimed at a whole class of managers in the Western countries.
It seems to be such a conviction among large parts of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content presents itself to the majority as increasingly foreign and outdated.
The demand for leadership, therefore, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of the disempowerment of the leading class and of the conventional political establishment. This is manifested in the unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the immediate change of the collective state of mind of the last time: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, there may also be a revolt in the United Kingdom.
One gains the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative of what is going on in the lower social layers of the West today and is still intensified and driven from the financial crisis to overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a “rebellion of the masses.”
Keeping your eyes wide open, however, is certainly not.
The super glue that makes walls go up
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which is now apparently almost at the target.
With an adhesive applied to an area of only 2.5 sqcm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a body weighing 100 kg on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged in a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect support.
Tests conducted with different materials such as glass teflon and abrasive paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the ability of the reptile’s feet to hold and at the same time “removes it from the wall without any problems,” said Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transient adhesive," Liming Dai adds.
Maybe, but the researchers are more likely to think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other fields of application could fall into the field of space travel.
For now, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER WAY OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that clean themselves from dust like hair by moving on a surface itself, thus always maintaining perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage when taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption by the body.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with drug intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again made an alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the intake capacity of certain vital medicines to such an extent that they are virtually eliminated from patients’ health.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatic drugs, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICIALS IN DANGER – The same drug agency had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix in a report two years ago, stressing to pay attention to what is being drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepan or metadone.
It’s not just grapefruit – according to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Michele Carruba, director of the Universit<0xC3><0xA0> Statale di Milano, said: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers who are thus free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there is still any ambiguity, do not be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the expert of the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize awarded to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Economic Prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more crucial to U.S. history than the assassinations.
A prediction that received little polemics in response and was presented to the economist years later, but proves to be completely correct today.
“I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye,” Krugman said in a statement at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "econom of great value", but also a banaliser with a "very aggressive style that is particularly opposed to the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration, as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some novelties to the audience: in addition to a revised and now more spartanized initial menu, finally a guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x is achieved, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO.
Eight against was also the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Some new features are also interesting, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, making it easier to send via email, including the ability to import PDF files into graphics editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
In this way, "hybrid" PDF files can also be generated, which extend the typical graphic of the Adobe format with the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the application: tables can now be edited by multiple hands by different users, avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a query to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are in the process of releasing various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, so it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Apart from Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
While cost-freeness may be an incentive for the program to be distributed in private households, it is also particularly in the business sector where OpenOffice could be a big hit: after all, various public administration and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized companies, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the spreadsheet program aimed at supplanting Excel; Impress, for creating presentations like with Powerpoint; Dbase for running databases instead of the more familiar Access; and finally Draw, a graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Kohl also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case will open up within the framework of the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-classer and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news published the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth rider to be tested positive for Cera, the third-generation Epo, which was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of cabbage are among those made in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and also notified the Austrian authorities, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY RASSICAL?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only received with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times is asking in a long article devoted entirely to the theme of racism in Italy, starting from the case of the young Burkina Faso-born Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case bears witness to what the Times calls the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where "the most integration and job opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North is recorded".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting in the Quirinal for a cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Victims of high rents of up to 900 euros per room
The housing market for students has no crises.
According to the latest investigation by Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
“This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits, so many students are losing their right to study because their families are not able to support them at this level,” says Sunia’s executive Laura Mariani, “in these cities, the high demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also harmed the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorised sub-rentals.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices through a revision of the taxation.
On closer examination of the investigation, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the Brianza district is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are for a bed of necessity, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only slightly lower are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>.
Only those who dodge in outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a place to sleep and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a place to sleep, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of rental to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents that are 25-30% above the average are demanded by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas close due to the favoured multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This image by director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means death in the long run for the one-room cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
Affected are mostly historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you've traveled a piece of road full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who earned him the Oskar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago. It's the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a probably lost cinema world.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the vast number of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; this mine paid for the most part the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The regions most affected include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main culprit is the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but first and foremost, the preservation of what already exists, because a hall in the city closes, not all its regular customers are ready to go to a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here the missing budget for the fund of the trade association remains externally eight: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral standpoint that the government does not comply with existing laws.
In order to maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be in need.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, because of the fears of the old cinemas, has decided to protect them by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historic center and in the periphery.
Among the measures foreseen are tax concessions for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic-limited areas of the centre and also to park at lower parking fees.
"It's a gratifying initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also design new concepts.
Certainly, however, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because after all, the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to avoid seeing the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The allegations against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at that time to a compensation of 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
“So it had been made possible for the mafia group – according to the judges – to enter the town halls by official means and to co-determine the policy of public administration.”
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter connections of local administrations and organised crime."
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who maintain a white vest."
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, with which, according to the police of the clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but as early as 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the May 2006 runoff election.
He screamed scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He appealed to Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of inventing everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with this morning’s arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request an amendment to the A3 project.
From a wiretapping action in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making the public administration’s measures identical with the interests of this clan.”
When the energy emanates from the waves, the big ones suddenly run up
It is a non-ferrous source of money covering over 70% of the planet’s surface, and only now do the world’s major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; not by chance, these studies intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gasified, but now the environmental organizations and the increased price of oil are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be met by the energies generated by the ocean waves.
This would be twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are also currents and tides.
Giants in attack.
The first company to now rely on marine energy is Enersis, which in 2005 signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in the north of Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies in the traditional energy industry are now relying on marine energy production.
“Chevron is examining these technologies,” said the spokesman for a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, and is considering the possibility of working with us.”
It is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that oil is still being extracted by the United States in Alaska and that President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, then observers speak of an increasing interest.
Improved technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still on the rise, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
So far, there are four planned facilities of this type, which are only waiting for state approval, and some of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a department store and a parking lot using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator due to the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Production Research, a particular interest deserves the potential that lies in the tides right now.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy that has led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
