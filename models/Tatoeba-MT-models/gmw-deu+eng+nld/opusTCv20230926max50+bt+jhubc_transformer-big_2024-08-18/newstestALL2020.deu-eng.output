Fire in French chemical plant extinguished
The big fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. This was announced by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday in the night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in operation with around 200 fire trucks.
The fire could be stopped.
Residents were asked not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. Additives for lubricants are produced in the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work at the plant. In the past, the chemical factory made headlines - for example, when in 2013 the gas methanethiol escaped due to a leak and the environment smelled far-reaching like rotten eggs. In 2015, after a business accident, around 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing dog for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job extra. Seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short break in Montana. 57 days were missing any trace of the dog - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left bitch Katie in the hotel room while they went for dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had put the dog in panic
In the hope that Katie might still be somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King remembers to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days went by weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told "Daily Inter Lake", who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man called and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her dog stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered all the people in her yard.
Losses in the German Armed Forces: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27. September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine guns. The whereabouts are in most cases unclear. The opposition speaks of a "terrifying" extent.
Weapons and ammunition are constantly disappearing in the Bundeswehr – many of them without a trace until now. Since the beginning of 2014, the force recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and almost 20,000 shots of ammunition. This is apparent from a list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which the editorial network Germany reports on.
According to the paper from the office of defense secretary of state Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon part and 3474 shots of ammunition have so far reappeared. The weapons and weapons parts that have still disappeared include six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven guns of the type G3, four guns of the type G36, six weapons of the type M36 and six weapons of the type.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses at the Bundeswehr was "terrifying", said the left-wing Bundestag member A. Renner. This is all the more true, since hardly anything has been found again in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance sheet". Renner criticized that the list of the under-armed was also found to be unrecognizable by the underarmed.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its detention by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas this Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set off and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters. The shipping company said that they wanted to wait for an official notice from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was charged on July 19 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the Strait of Hormuz on charges of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary arrest of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belongs to Britain.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of global oil exports are shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region have increased immensely in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel Appreciates People's Courage in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU group on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor said she was reminded, among other things, of the German unity.
Musk seeks extradition record
Tesla’s quarter may hold a record, but despite a boom in deliveries, the electric car company has recently suffered losses.
“We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog ‘Electrek’.
Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk’s newsletter said, with the challenge of bringing the cars to the customers quickly, with Tesla having to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s stocks went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not risen so strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered over 95,000 cars, reaching its previous best.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-digit figures in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Solved puzzle: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of braking in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found this out with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress was also made in the question of why children are so fiercely resisting tickling, only to then demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter before the touch, which is due to a deep layer in the cerebrum, which already triggers laughter when the tickling is expected.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound range when tickled by humans. This "laughter" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and touch by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out in the experiments on the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during a self-contact. This is also the case when the brains are tickling themselves.
But if the self-touching and the touching of others happen at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between the self-touching and the touching of others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because the self-touching activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. In doing so, they sometimes broke off this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showed flight behavior or scaryness. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The tickling ambivalence is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Catastrophe averted: Large fire in French chemical plant extinguished
The big fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. This was reported by the Normandy Prefecture to the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire erupted on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no harmful substances are said to have leaked. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in operation with around 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were asked not to leave their homes, buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first meeting in Parliament following the abolition of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on October 31 without an agreement, should Brussels not engage in his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
Speaking about Cox, who had campaigned for Britain’s stay in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: “The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and reunite this country would be to complete the EU exit.” Cox had been assassinated by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum election campaign.
Monument to Oslo and Utöya attacks is unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims is unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of around 1,000 iron rose replicas. They recall the roses that thousands of people had deposited in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
The project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be unveiled at the same location – the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
On 22 July 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first ignited a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and subsequently shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on the island of Utöya.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate did not solve the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to re-emerge. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been detained in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now heading to Dubai for medical investigations, among other things, said shipping chief Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell. By noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told the Swedish television channel SVT.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to compromise the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," the statement said.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had detained the tanker on July 19 on charges of disregarding maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, H<0xC3><0xA5>nell said. They would have been able to work together quickly in the face of the difficult and agitating situation in the past ten weeks to re-emerge with their families.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar behind the arrest of the "Stena Impero": In early July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been destined for Syria, was chained there. The delivery violated EU sanctions against the war country Syria, according to the authorities. The reference to the ship had been received by the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Suspects that it was an exchange to get rid of the "Stena Impero", London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are being shipped through the straits. Tensions in the region have exacerbated immensely in recent months. Trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the US withdrew on its own from the international nuclear agreement, which should prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has been pushing Iran to expand its leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for the military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz to the UN General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection powers.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India seems to be predestined to be a "war-winner" branch. Given the punitive tariffs imposed by America's President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to relocate. Chiefs of finance of Asian companies, who are considering to move their production from China to another country, call India in a UBS poll to play a billion dollar role as one of the world's preferred trade unions.
But now India itself has got into Trump’s focus. Devalued by the White House as the “kingdom of tariffs”, America has withdrawn from the emerging market at the beginning of June the trade concessions for 2,000 products. The United States accuse India of prohibitively high tariffs and demand better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India are, of course, merely a side-show. In addition, America views the world’s largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concerns about China’s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvage of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just stepped into office as a second-year, may have been in security.
The problem, however, seems to be in another place: the empirically substantiated thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development is difficult in the socialist Republic of India. Even under modes. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness, which for too long in the multi-ethnic state suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has turned for the better in India in the first five mode years. But this is not the case in trade policy. Inspired by protecting internationally low-competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even established new barriers.
In the West, Modi is attached to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who is radically renewing his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At the core, however, the "India First" lawyers are never short of a protectionist economic policy, which prevents them from becoming so obsessed with the traditional business.
Funeral of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
Former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried in the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital on Monday, reported the news agency AFP citing the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. A public funeral ceremony was scheduled for Sunday at the Paris Invalidendom, as reported by the media.
Carried to the goal of the competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championship
The world’s top was already long in the goal, when heart-warming scenes took place in the downcooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swing dangerously. He could barely hold his feet 300 meters before the goal, running in an unhealthy bent position, as Braima Suncar Dabo was already running to stop him in the last half hour.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation could have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. Shy he first dissuaded, did not want to talk about his heroic act at all. After all he wanted to set his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult to run in, he just wanted to be proud of my country.
He did this on the evening strongly - and much more intensely than he would have imagined. Because this heroic act will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even made his competitor Busby the lead in the goal and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this run.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had started to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this succeeded with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes already". However, only in training, there do not count best times.
Millionaire: Egyptians prepare for wild day of protest
In Egypt, security measures have been intensified in advance of possible government-critical protests. An increased police presence was observed in the center of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
In recent days, the police had already intensified their road controls and partially searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, accusing the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Spanish exiled Egyptian builder and actor Mohammed Ali's most recent campaign "has brought to the attention of the people of the country"
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures could not be confirmed at first. The government also did not confirm and comment on the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have been "involuntarily arrested" "only because they were 'at the wrong time in the wrong place'", HRW said, citing lawyers arrested. According to their lawyers, the allegations against the arrested range from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association".
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, blocking websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: shipping companies should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up on the rubbish. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While the companies could not be exempted from the VAT on donations in kind, the ministry explained on a question by the Green Bundestag group, which the newspapers of the Funke-Mediengruppe reported on Friday, the traders could, however, use the market value of the non-saleable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the Germans return every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the trash. To donate them would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the tax authorities evaluate material donations as a turnover, which then is subject to sales tax.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies cannot evaluate products for sale accordingly and can donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. The companies should be able to rely on not to be punished for donations. This applies not only to online retail but also to other fashion stores.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is due to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work emphasizes "the reconstruction of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it will be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the South West of the UK, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had re-exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The image could change the owner for a million dollars.
On Wednesday at the first session of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, after a forced break imposed by the Supreme Court by Johnson, had made a tough deal with the opposition. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit already twice postponed on 31 October, if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted a picture depicting a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. The factory sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit debate is like a “walk in the park”
The violent verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," Dominic Cummings said at a book presentation on Friday. "We will enjoy it. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days and accused them of, among other things, “treason” to the people, allegations that he could put MPs at risk because they could become targets of murder threats, he dismissed as “humbug.”
Cummings said the only way to rest is if MEPs finally respect the British decision to leave the EU, and it is not surprising that people are upset that Britain still hasn’t left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistani Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance in front of the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If that goes bad, one hopes for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. In early August, India had withdrawn its autonomy status from the Indian Kashmir region and thus increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It fires with sharp ammunition on the population, over 2000 detainees join in the prisons with the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting in Egypt has never been safe. But since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything to avoid a scenario of
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions to the streets. And that is a problem that even the el-Sisi regime does not get under control, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, one in three people in Egypt live below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is at ten percent. Those who want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket have to decide who they finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is responsible not only for the oppression but also the largest economic actor it has ever experienced. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, food has been a lot more
Tüv checks in the terminal: BER boss: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
For two months, it was examined whether the complicated system mesh in the BER fire protection works in conjunction. The operators are satisfied with the progress. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year, which is certain, said Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control panel.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there are still defects in the terminal to be worked out. "We have a lot of detail topics, but we don't have a real showstopper". He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the Bauamt during the first quarter of 2020. At the beginning of the year, this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables are still to be fixed; the Tüv intends to examine them by February. "In order to create the conditions for the commencement of flight operations, intensive work must continue to be carried out on the processing of the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no clearance for all plugs on which the cable tracks hang. The airport chief expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet satisfactory. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that shut down in a fire like a canvas, so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there should be new trials with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Initially, it was intended to go into operation in 2011. Since construction began in 2006, costs have increased from two billion euros to expected around 6.5 billion euros at the opening next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the responsible persons are planning to expand the airport, which is why it will take place at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief Financial Officer Heike Fölster is moving to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR Chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Machines for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and chased several vending machines into the air in the city of Chemnitz! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket vending machines blasted in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply.
The police caught a 33-year-old German after two detonations at the end of May on the Bürgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation for the inducement of explosives explosions in the detention unit with particularly serious case of the theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesperson: "With the prey, he apparently financed his narcotics dependence". Between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019, the bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on the civil road four times alone.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60,000 euros!
The vending machine bomber is now in custody, and the police investigation against him continues.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further machine blasts in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price fight with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA "takes over the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", a Austrian Airlines press spokesman told APA on Friday. "AviationNetOnline" had previously reported about this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa airline Eurowings will be de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. From January 2020, the AUA will take over in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed, which will be taken over from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter aircraft to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning. The flight times are to be coordinated for connecting flights. The aim is on the one hand to strengthen the Vienna hub and on the other hand to expand decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "Production Company" for the Group's sister AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. The on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the AUA flight number, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA are not as shown in the terminal.
After the Niki plea, a price fight broke out at Vienna airport. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airliner sends four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticized as a bypass construct for the collective agreement.
Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary’s statement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years said AUA CEO Andreas Otto on Friday: “We will remain the number one in the location, in five, six or ten years.”
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four marries. Beatrice is engaged!
Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have stopped for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) in the Italy holidays earlier this month, which the palace announced on Thursday.
“We’re thrilled to announce our engagement, and we’re both so excited to start this adventure together and can’t wait to actually be married,” the couple said in a statement.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have been taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information on the date, location and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne succession and the real estate mogul will be a similarly large celebration as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9000 healthy and sick people.
By analyzing the genome of 9,000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kuehne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain Hospital, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy diets are among the key influencing risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors help determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it said. Now the scientists want to compare the entire genome of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at UKE.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to cause possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations -, according to the clinic, about 200 would be added each year.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in researching other popular diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a firm will to use the data for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the foundation in Davos deals with mainly allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be created on the medical campus there, and a professorship for bioinformatics in Hamburg has been created very gratefully.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world, according to the clinic. In the genetic decryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Mochs University of Zurich.
According to the UKE, a person’s genetic material can now be decoded within 24 hours. The mere material cost would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to start on 1 October, and all 9,000 samples are to be analysed by the end of 2020. First results are expected in the year after.
Nigerian Police Release Hundreds of Abused Boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. According to locals, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of them still underage, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them said to have been raped by their teachers," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and "improved". In fact, the protégés were held by their teachers under "most degrading and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
The Koran School has been around for about ten years. Local residents have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents were shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran School, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighboring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police release 400 children from school
“Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries indicating torture,” police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in Kaduna City.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after a clue in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "unworthy of human beings". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all of them boys, were held as slaves at their school and chained, some of whom were sexually abused, while television footage showed worn-out and injured students in a recognizably poor state of health.
World Footballer’s Election: Further allegations after Messis and Klopp’s Kür
Football "signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Federation honors the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honour and thus record.
After Nicaragua’s captain stated that he had never voted in the World Footballer’s election, accusations come from other countries against FIFA. Egypt was not valued at all – with a curious reasoning.
In recent years, many things in FIFA have proved to be objectionable: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Footballer election has so far not been suspected of being improperly run - if one does not consider that the voting national coaches and national team members are more likely to be members of the national team.
However, after Nicaragua’s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now emerging: Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
FIFA apologises for the fact that "the signatures on the election forms were given in capital letters and were therefore not valid" and contacted the Egyptian Federation several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan's coach is also surprised.
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese federation states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally rated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to Fifa, the sub-voting of the sudanes, however, was just as well received by the official letters,
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera said: "I did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details about my vote are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
The association said on Friday that it was true, but of course it was not intentional. The official ballot papers were "errorly" provided with the name and the signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, said in a communication of the association. But the second captain, Manuel Rosas, was actually elected. "So, as the coach of the team said, we take responsibility for the administrative error," said the statement.
The other cases have now been examined by FIFA in an investigation, but emphasized that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Footballer's Choice - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly spoken out for an official investigation against US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being determined". He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair can lead to the president's filing before action is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been watching Biden “for years.”
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump for the whistleblower affair, few have seen discomfort because of it. Scott’s remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party, while the moderate governor of Virginia has already turned against Trump’s policies on several occasions, such as the easing of environmental protection regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker also spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, formally have no say in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. However, first senators of Republicans have also criticized the situation. For example, Mitt Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said the case was “extremely disturbing to the Republicans, deeply disturbing to the internal.”
The affair could result in the initiation of impeachment proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into this and accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no exact timetable for the impeachment procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could impose a so-called impeachment. However, the decision to actually impeach them fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no U.S. president has been impeached by an impeachment procedure of the office.
Were torturers on board rackets "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had illegally driven the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was revoked after a few days by an Italian judge.
Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We can't rule out any new information"
Police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," it said in the statement.
NGOs and aid organisations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed".
Italy’s right-wing former interior minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk seeks Tesla’s extradition record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost to the stock market with the prospect of new record figures.
“We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email posted by the industry blog “Electrect” to Tesla employees.
Demand is strong, allowing Tesla to record 110,000 orders, Musk’s newsletter said, with the challenge of bringing the cars to the customers quickly, with Tesla having to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s stocks went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not risen so strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-digit figures in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
U.S. budget dispute: Only bridge funding again
The new fiscal year will begin in the US on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 financial years, the United States is once again without spending plans before the new fiscal year, which begins on October 1st. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on a transitional funding (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21st.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration will now be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the 2019 financial year ending Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws in time, which allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. For the time being, the federal administration cannot benefit from the spending framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio.
The Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, have completed ten of the twelve laws, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are barely eligible for a majority.
The minds are split mainly on the issue of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for wall building, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are disturbed by the wall building plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the wall building had already led to a shutdown in December 2018.
On the wall, the ghosts separate
It is currently unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional funding beyond November 21st. A shutdown is also not excluded at that time.
Against the background of the Congress's continued inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in good time, and the associated danger of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the federal administration's funding would automatically continue at the previous year's level, preventing parliamentarians' travel activities, and withholding their wages until the new annual spending plans lay in place.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization should also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which is expected to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agn<0xC3><0xA8>s Buzyn defended as a "opportunity" for society. It depicts the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to them, the cost of artificial insemination for all women is to be borne by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband still prohibited
By a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past where women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased person.
Numerous members of the ruling party La République en Marche (LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition, on the other hand, had advocated artificial fertilization with the deceased partner’s sperm, stressing that a widow would be imposed a “double grief” if her husband’s death left her childish desires unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow may be fertilized in the future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot have children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women – however, it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate Compensation: Calls for air fares for universities are getting louder
Much is flown at the universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about a climate tax on flights from universities and colleges, postponed before the summer break, is still in the swing again. After the rectors' conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six universities in Baden-Württemberg are still required to make a statement in July.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the detainees were said to have illegally fished in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested. At that time there was a gunfire between the border guards and the boat crew. In the process, three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no injuries, it was said.
North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages, according to which North Korean fishermen were on their way to Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard is conducting patrols to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 squid confiscated
30,000 octopus fish were discovered and confiscated on the boats, and three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s fisheries authorities had not issued fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there for some time this year, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, also recently complained of high ecological damage from the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-knit synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these also small living creatures would be brought out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need 200 years.
Only 18,000 left in the future: U.S. cuts asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is shooting itself off against asylum seekers: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the ceiling for the legal migration of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will be granted asylum.
The U.S. government wants to lower the already historically low threshold for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be allowed into the country, according to the U.S. State Department. In the already almost ended fiscal year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump’s administration has drastically reduced the readiness for protection seekers from around the world in recent years, with far higher reception limits being applied under Barack Obama’s predecessor government.
The target cap of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was introduced in 1980, but the U.S. Department of State described it as “the most compassionate and generous nation in history,” a formulation strongly reminiscent of the incumbent U.S. president’s use of language.
A “responsible approach” to refugees is aimed at allowing the refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild, Trump said. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to shut down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a possible impending impeachment process.
According to the Foreign Office, the US government wants to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are therefore in danger, as shown by the statement of the Foreign Ministry, while a maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be welcomed from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The U.S. wants people from this "northern triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries, which is why the U.S. has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the U.S. southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires at the request of the Argentine judiciary to a human ape collection station in the USA. Sandra, born in 1986 in Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release was mandatory. The animal was brought by direct flight to Dallas on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room.
Since the 53 kilograms of human effigy is not able to adapt to life in the wild, it is expected to live in the open enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly a pet of pop star Michael Jackson. However, before moving into Florida, there is still a 40-day stay in the neighborhood.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process for "Sandras" fundamental rights has helped to transform the zoo of Buenos Aires into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and education facility for the preservation of biodiversity is to be created there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 metres in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride at the almost 3000 meters high Great Tinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double floor or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent, thereby undercutting the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
U.S. sports goods manufacturer Nike recorded a significant gain despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars (nearly 1.3 billion euros) in the past quarter. This is 25 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, as the company announced on Tuesday. The reason for this is mainly the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Turnover rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August, with Nike’s strongest sales growth of 22 percent in China, benefiting Beaverton, Oregon, from its approach to addressing consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Andy Campion, chief financial officer, announced that Nike will continue to drive the sporting goods manufacturer’s “digital transformation” with strategic investments, thus expanding its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures – the sporting goods manufacturer’s shares increased by more than five percent.
Lifetime ban on stadiums due to racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan in 2016. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and urged his club to take action. "<0x40>officialasroma the 28th as you know what to do with such a fan.
The club responded late Thursday, reporting the fan’s account on Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporter is never allowed to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly, Italian fans scandalize racist insults against black players from rival teams. "We can't have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation hasn't improved, and that's very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino had said at the weekend.
However, there had also been recent discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rival fans of record champion Juventus Turin from entering the stadium. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. According to the rest, bans apply from four to seven years.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of, among other things, severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with a complaint last year.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black trafficking of tickets, they had the ticket trade for the fan curve "militarily controlled" and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the Generation Z is political - whole vintages are thought of with handy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With this call officially started on September 21, the crab catch at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also heralded the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Relations of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaoch offers all of its inhabitants to Ganoch.
People in Gaochun have already started growing crabs at the beginning of the 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that provided high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively pursued a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of the cultivation of crabs.
In recent years, Gaochun has pushed forward a reform to "distribution of power, optimisation of administration and government services" and carefully built up the service network for "approvals under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending", aiming to maximise the city's environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the locally given benefits by connecting to the southern Jiochsu and the southern Anhui's high level of tourism. Gaoch's high level of tourism is highly appreciated by the local authorities. The development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a flagship to lead to intelligent high-end production enterprises, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, the cultural and health sector, as well as well as businesses for ecological agriculture.
Iran-U.S. conflict: Ruhani talks about end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, on his return from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer by the United States to lift sanctions, and the United States, in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, put an end to all sanctions, Ruhani said on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted Iran's counterpart on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
“The kind of sanctions that should be put to an end have stood up to debate,” added Ruhani, “and they have all clearly said that we have all been on the floor, and they have all been on the floor,” he said.
However, this move was not carried out in an acceptable manner, criticized Ruhani. In view of the existing punitive measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This should prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump on the fringes of the UN General Assembly.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
Turkey's fears of a catastrophe are growing after two earthquakes hit western Turkey in a very short time. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day, there have been nearly 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday, increasing the concern of a catastrophe.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons and hundreds of buildings have been damaged. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the million-dollar metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built homes collapse - among other things, murmured by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which were registered as a refuge in the center, have long since been built.On the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Civil Engineering Chamber of Istanbul warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul are not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the Thursday quake was in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of about seven kilometers, the civil protection authority Afad announced. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the roads a few minutes later.
Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu told Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students wept as seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when the earthquake comes, it is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies are designing emergency plans, private individuals have packed so-called go-bags with all the necessities of standing next to doors, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth is shaking.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques collapsed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning for aftershocks in Istanbul
On social networks, many users reported panic. Buildings were shaking. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday’s, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter about aftershocks. He called people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the quake is 1.59 p.m. (local time). Just minutes after the first quake, there was a aftershock, according to CNN Turkey, which was reported at a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt as far as Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the million-dollar metropolis, the civil protection authority Afad already announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers believe that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe it will discharge at some point - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. It would have become more likely, he told CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy told the station. "Early or later, the great quake will also come."
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In addition, in Albania only a few days ago there had been a violent earthquake - there were 68 injured. Also this year at Lake Constance the earth had been shaking.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
On the way to a possible impeachment procedure, the US Democrats see themselves reinforced: The complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president, which contains important indications of the whistleblower as a whistleblower, once again sees itself as a victim of an investigation against the president.
United States: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - plane redirected
As a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight was rerouted by United Airlines, which had been blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said, according to U.S. media.
In an unplanned stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally freed from the tight cabin. About an hour ago, she had been locked in it, wrote US media citing other passengers. To continue flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the aircraft.
In a video on the Internet, which is said to come from Flight 1554, according to U.S. media, is seen as several people are trying to free the woman. "We're working at the moment to open the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" a man says in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. At first it was clear whether the woman would receive compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous story “The Transformation,” British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on 27 November, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. This is about the transformation of a man called "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to keep the will of the people in action and is not determined to do so.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like once the Soviet leaders, if Brexiteers in high positions are just begging for the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to that: write like the spring intelligence".
Kafka's first story, published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "transformed into an enormous vermin", is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually perishes.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria’s rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary will receive whisper brakes to reduce the noise pollution caused by freight trains and sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31st
The German tour operator Thomas Cook canceled all trips until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travel could not be started "for insolvency reasons," the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin brands, which have already been paid or paid in full. As is the case with travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the trap of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which includes among others Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to send money back to hotels
On the other hand, from this Friday onwards, hotels abroad, which currently still host Thomas Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from Zurich-Insurance.The payments to the hotels are, according to Zurich, subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked for extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas-Cook-travellers are not immediately asked or otherwise forced to pay individual hotel invoices from these hotels," said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company reacted to reports from hotel guests who were forced to pay their own accommodation on the spot. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Headquarters had strongly criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesperson said. According to data on Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook holidaymakers from Germany were still traveling. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return travel of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travelers who are currently on the move. For Thomas Cook customers who still want to fly on holiday, it looks bad. On late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips until including 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies to those bookings that have already been paid.
As far as travel with start from 1 November 2019 is concerned, the company left open. In consultation with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined. In principle, the insurance company Zurich is responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and make their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana's engagement, now following in the footsteps of his mother in Africa.
In Angola, British Prince Harry has ignited and destroyed an explosive mine with a blue splinter protection vest.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit in front of running TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 people.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry then wanted to follow in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to travel the path she went back then. The images on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She too had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist capital of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations stall: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated: with him, however, there will be guaranteed a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations to be ruled out. But what statements are in the polarizing British already of eternal duration. The recent verdict of the Supreme Court in the UK floats like a Damocles sword over the blond shovel. His suspension of the parliament in order to carry out his Brexit course to the end of October, Johnson has been obliged to resign a law to the beginning of the Brexit.
Boris Johnson thinks a deal is still possible
But the pressure doesn’t seem to pass to Johnson either, and while visiting a hospital, he suggested that he would support an extension of the negotiations in the event of a non-agreement by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31.
And best of all, with a deal, I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work out.
And time is running out of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. In the event of about six weeks, the EU and the British negotiators still have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But even the recent talks have again not made a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems at present rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a re-opposition of the exit date for the Prime Minister could somehow come into force.
U.S. authorities: Further deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injured in this context, the U.S. health authority CDC announced. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there are already more than 900 affected, some 500 of which are confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unknown in Europe.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Mohammed Ali’s videos have been shared millions of times in online networks, calling for a “people’s revolution” in Spain. For this Friday, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes mass rallies with a million participants in central places of the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. An increased police presence was already observed in the center of Cairo. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. In recent days, the police had intensified their road controls and searched the mobile phones of pedestrians partly on news and photos in connection with the protests.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. The security forces reacted accordingly harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2,000 people were arrested since last week. Many of them were arbitrarily arrested with HR in the wrong place. Just because they had been arrested in the wrong place, HR had been arrested.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country, blocking the government from blocking websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox from Greenland Expedition back
Polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday and was greeted on his arrival in the port of Hamburg by skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg with the racing yacht "Malizia" across the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the effects of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak up. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens at sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, Greenland glacier ice was measured with a drone and fished with nets for microplastics, it said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: That seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros of tip included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases harm Rome's reputation, and we call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, told the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant was prompt. The Japanese had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this cannot be seen from the bill. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, the innkeeper said.
After the turbulent revelations of the past few days, US President Donald Trump could actually face a impeachment procedure, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives now as soon as possible - it's talking about weeks before a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public out of concern for national security and for democracy of the United States with his complaint, is monstrous: The president actively abused the power of his office to use the government of another country to influence Ukraine.
The core of this project can also be seen in the now published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text, but the July 25 phone call is just an episode of a much larger story, centered alongside Trump primarily on his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public’s point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani’s travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected president Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows that his intentions are delicate. “We don’t interfere in an election, we can interfere in an investigation of what is very helpful to the government,” he says.
The lawyer and former New York City mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump’s 2016 election opponent: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for the Russia investigations in the US, but this accusation was never taken seriously.
It is about exactly the investigation that Trump will speak so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giuliani and the president is: The former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, as the Ukraine representative of the Obama administration, has been responsible for the dismissal of his then Ukrainian attorney general.
In fact, the process was a bit different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian prosecutor-general should leave, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Moreover, Schokin himself was deeply accused of corrupt behavior, the U.S. government was by far not the only Western partner to press for his release. In fact, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Disruptions on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. According to this, especially Germany, the UK and Spain are affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading again and again since about 3.30 pm. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also appears to be affected by the disruption, though not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disturbances
It’s not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had been down for several hours. And like in the previous cases, users are also using Twitter this time to air their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were traveling by inflatable boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in calamity - less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter needed to be rescued.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the message, at just before ten we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were above the dinghy".
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER charge wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come onto the market that support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When charging wirelessly, the researchers have measured even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad. On the other hand, the charging power is always higher than 30 degrees.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Because every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but it also does not last so long. So the lifespan is less. The researchers therefore advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery exchange in modern smartphones always has a high cost, this should be a helpful tip for Apple.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and tedious plug-in fumble. Since Qi (which stands for inductive energy transmission) is a worldwide standard, however, in the exceptional case even Apple is involved in the technology, there is hardly any restriction.
Everest-stairs photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months, Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 8,000 meters in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: From him comes a photo of mountaineers who are in line on Mount Everest virally gone in the spring.
The picture of the mass influx triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-metre-high mountain and highest peaks of the earth. In May, eleven climbers had died in the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. Among other reasons, bad weather is mentioned. Early week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to allow it to ascend.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous Sigiriya rock fortress, which was visited by many tourists. According to the police spokesman, the animals were presumably between the ages of 15 and 25. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously been harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants still live in Sri Lanka. Their killing is theoretically the death penalty.
British oil tanker detained leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its detention by Iran, according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had detained the British-flagged tanker on July 19 on charges of disregarding maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook's Management in Criticism
The responsible Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to thoroughly investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook, which is to deal with the salary packages of the Board of Directors as well as the question of why the British government did not want to financially join the survival-fighting company. "Our interest is in the supervision of the company as well as the control by external auditors", said the chairman of the committee, Rachel Reeves, in London.
According to experts, genes are overestimated in colorectal cancer risk
Researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg have come to this conclusion in a recent study. Other risk factors, such as family eating habits, are therefore likely to be more severe than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of colorectal cancer, emphasize the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk raises Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog “Electrect” and demand is strong, so Tesla could record 110,000 orders, it said in Musk’s newsletter.
The challenge is to get the cars to the customers quickly, with Tesla having to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s stocks went out of business with an increase of more than six percent. The price hasn’t risen so strongly for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered over 95,000 cars, reaching its previous best.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he plans to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Will the UK government bypass Brexit law? Johnson reluctantly
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the last law passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit, and on a question to journalists on Friday, he merely said his government would abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use “political harassment” to circumvent the law, and that Johnson could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law until after the EU exit.
Johnson said he is seeking a treaty with the European Union: “We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31st, and the best way to do that is with an agreement.”
Iran seems to increase uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on European counterparts in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states show inability or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions," Rouhani said Thursday at a press conference on the fringe of the UN General Assembly in New York. In case they were not to meet their promises, he put in the prospect of "further steps away" from the agreement in 2015.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US withdrew from the agreement on its own in 2018 to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change course in the deemed more aggressive Middle East policy. The government of President Donald Trump wants to retaliate with Iran's tough resurgence in a tougher resurgence.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium or at least prepared for use, and that Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges, according to IAEA data.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to bear their share of the deal, and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burdens of oppressive US sanctions, Rouhani suspected, but there will still be further talks that hopefully bring a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the situation changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom on Monday followed the U.S. assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Initially, Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had known about the attack, but this was seen as a false allegation by the U.S. on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," Rouhani said. However, the European leaders had not been able to do so during the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they had only invoked that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met in recent days with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Johnson.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the US administration’s far-reaching sanctions would have to be lifted, Rouhani said, calling on the Washington administration to shift to a policy of “dialogue and reason.”
Comet of other star intersects solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space, which has only succeeded before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a presumption is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named after its explorer at 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The long-distance comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up observations from various observatories confirmed not only that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not originate from our solar system.
After 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object to be spotted on a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close-up glimpses of a strange solar system before it disappears in no time. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reported. "The current velocity of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, from the Sun's typical range, which is about about 150,000 kilometers per hour."
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperbolic pathway that takes it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its explorer, the interstellar tail star, which was first identified as the second object in the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was discovered by her.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in approach, leaving the researchers many months for investigations. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "After that, it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor, such as a team led by Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in a first study the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Photographs of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a distinct tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that its composition may have to be similar," reported LeAC researcher Julia de Kom<0xC3><0xB3>n, similar to our other solar systems.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors may be able to intercept a planned satellite mission by the European space agency Esa.
The agency intends to station the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" in a waiting position within 1.5 million kilometers from Earth by 2028. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it will either be lurking on an still pristine, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'um.
First landing at Beijing's new Daxing Mega Airport
Just in time for the 70th birthday of the People’s Republic: a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines has landed on the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers will be handled annually at the new airport, and by 2025 it will already be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China's latest prestige project is also called "sea star" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world’s largest automated air traffic management system. A new subway will transport passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly stated that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and much smaller - has been postponed again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger aircraft landed after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - of which the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams. To make possible this supersonic flight targeted for the 2030s a special propulsion (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) that the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire is developing, the US broadcaster CNN said the agency could very well do the work.
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work closely with the Australian Air Force. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis is currently taking about 20 hours. The only supersonic aircraft to date for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003, and it took three to three-and-a-half hours for this to be developed. In 2000, the plane was jointly designed by the U.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere, thus enabling the "next generation of truly reusable spacecraft".
Washington riot: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump said Thursday in front of U.S. embassy staff at the United Nations in New York. The person affected was almost "a spy" and had been dealt with "a bit differently" in the past than today.
This was seen as an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was actually not public. However, several U.S. media broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted indignantly to the president’s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday announced preparations for impeachment proceedings against Trump. Their allegations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who makes serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. Under heavy public pressure, the whistleblower’s descriptions were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials, according to which the U.S. president "uses the power of his office" to achieve that another country interferes in his favor in the 2020 U.S. election.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate what could harm his political rival Joe Biden, which is about past affairs of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his pro-democracy biennial from the Ukrainian judiciary in 2020.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up with a view to the Ukraine phone call: Leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been prepared. This was only published after the conversation on the instruction of lawyers from the White House. However, a specially protected database was stored in a database that was usually intended for this purpose.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, and the New York Times reported that it was supposed to be an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had disseminated second-hand information that turned out to be inaccurate. Therefore, there may not be any tippers or spies at all.
As Trump expressed his views in New York on those who were supposed to have provided information to the whistleblower, but sparked outrage, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reacted with concern and lamented that Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and his environment have been underway in various committees for months now, and in light of the Ukrainian allegations, the Democrats are now pushing ahead with investigations with new force to initiate a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the Intelligence Committee at the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump sharply attacked Schiff, accused him of misrepresenting things and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly denounced ship and had demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. security and foreign policy officials, most of whom were under Democratic and Republican presidents, backed the Democrats’ investigation into a possible impeachment process in a statement released Friday, saying if the allegations were true, Trump’s “a ruthless abuse of power.”
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could enforce a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual impeachment fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been impeached by an impeachment procedure of the office.
VW works council: jobs are being "smoothed"
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce production costs could come at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the works council of the car manufacturer around. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros by 2023, of which 500 million euros are to be saved already this year.
A key factor for this is the personnel costs. The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be dismantled at the car manufacturer if it is proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment guarantees apply until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works councils, however, jobs in production, which were not actually available, are "slowly" dismantled via another path - i.e. past the official course. Thus, free-coming regular positions would often not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the works council has no way of enforcing the reoccupation. Meanwhile, in many places personnel are missing, labour compaction is increasing, the concerns about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would be greater. This also raises the fear that vehicle production could be gradually deducted from Germany and Europe, because it is socially favorable in other parts of the world.
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and centrally control new projects. This is also intended to reduce costs and also accelerate decisions - the goal behind this is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production manager Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves stand firm".
There are already successes in this way: for example, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on the production time do not mention VW, according to information our newspaper, the Golf 7 is around
20 hours.
In our region, the main Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the rule of thumb that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year, so that the plant is satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles.
As production manager Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars are to roll off the belt in Wolfsburg "perspectively", which is to make the bundling of the golf production at the main plant possible - because the Zwickau plant delivers the golf production due to the conversion to the site for the electric car production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently been declining. Therefore, expectations are now resting on the Golf 8.
Voodoo forced into prostitution: human traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, thrown into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had sent young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. To force their obedience, the Nigerian women who wanted to leave Nigeria had yet to leave home in front of a voodoo priest to perform a ritual.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean in inflatable boats with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to deal with the alleged smuggler costs of an average of 25,000 euros. The wages were therefore completely reduced.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the infiltration and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the trial. "The work made the women physically and mentally difficult to achieve," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said in the verdict. "Some were rightly disgusted."
The verdicts are based on the commercial and gang-like infiltration of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant union Ufo has again threatened with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "inform on 14 October about the labour-fighting measures in the LH Group," said Ufo Tariff Board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have refused to hold collective bargaining negotiations with the Ufo for months. This also concerns the question whether the trade union has legally terminated collective bargaining agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to have the collective agreements not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined to appeal against it. "I think that a second court sees the matter completely different, I think it is unlikely," said Ufo CEO Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Frankfurt State Labour Court to have Ufo’s status as a trade union reviewed by the court. The company argues that the union had not appointed a representative board for months and was thus unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
A fierce leadership dispute in the divisional trade union had preceded, during which numerous members of the Board of Directors and the Advisory Board have resigned, including longtime union chief Nicoley Baublies. The UFO had suspended a preliminary vote on strikes by the cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about their leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but that should change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the aim is to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
“The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia has hitherto been difficult for tourists. Visas are usually only granted for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes for more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production drastically collapsed, oil price shots increased, and it is likely to take several weeks for the kingdom’s oil production to reach its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber in preparation for wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos on her Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits, including banana-printed suits, on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding". According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry church next weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers had given themselves the yes word in a New York City registry office, and there was no greater feast at the time.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a wooded area near the city of Mecin, the police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the aircraft since Thursday evening after the crew had issued an emergency signal by GPS. A military helicopter was also in the search. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, non-resident species, unsustainable woodcuts and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, the World Nature Conservation Union (IUCN) reported in Brussels on Friday. It examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them are not found on any other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of the threat and therefore.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", "extinct" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct". In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Wild Horse Chestnut Threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) is particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the Deutsche Presse Agentur. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild Ordinary Horse Chestnuts. They have been considered "endangered" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat, in addition to a fungus, is the Balkan miner moth. It has been spreading from southeastern Europe throughout the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts in Europe as a species.
Species of shrubs and mosses also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than one-fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in recy
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office.
Earthquake in Istanbul: 34 people injured
The latest earthquake in Turkey has injured 34 people, deaths have not been reported, dozens of people have had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged, with nearly 200 aftershocks since the earthquake the previous day. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday, triggering panic in the million-dollar metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian plates.
One of the heaviest earthquakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
As early as Tuesday, a 4.6-strong quake had shaken the region around Istanbul, prompting residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl, which the singers announced on Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is insanely excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be as far as Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996, when she saw Diana Ross flying to the sky at the halftime show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina," she said.
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she was honored to be on one of the biggest stages in the world alongside another artist, representing Latinos and Latinas from the US and around the world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "kings" were on one stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Combating declining audience numbers
The Super Bowl is the culmination of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the US. Even though your audience numbers have dropped recently: this February, the spectacle in the US attracted the fewest spectators in more than ten years. Yet, it was still nearly a hundred million people on average.
The halftime show of the past Super Bowl had been agitated in advance: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, according to media reports, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the halftime show - the reviews were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was on his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL political matches at the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump did not attack the most African American football stars since March 2017.
Cook plea: hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to face the bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook expensive, according to a press report. There are high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans, which is also affected by Credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make a total depreciation of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion on their books, according to the report, according to estimates by the consulting company AlixPartners.
Creditors of bonds would have to accept amortizations of <0xC2><0xA3>900 million to <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion and lenders between <0xC2><0xA3>550 million and <0xC2><0xA3>825 million, the actual amounts to be depreciated are likely to be at the top of the bandwidths, an expert told the paper.
After the insolvency proceedings have ended, the losses of creditors will become apparent. A person close to this procedure did not spray too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook’s approximately 40 aircraft in the UK are “old” and many of the properties are in bad locations. Most money could probably be made out with the sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, the company said.
Rackete allegedly brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we don't even have secure information about it," said Sea-Watch spokesperson Ruben Neugebauer, the dpa news agency.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, ramming a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects also arrived there. The captain is under investigation for aid to illegal immigration.
U.S. Warns Federal Government of Huawei
The head of the US Internet agency Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe the risks are too high,” Pai told the “Handelsblatt” with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that obliges any company “under Chinese law” to follow the instructions of the security bodies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC chief said, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the German government has agreed to demand a "confidence statement" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt", citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not just hardware:
It is the software that is important to keep the devices up-to-date and consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "no matter where, would be able to review every single update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief said.
He accuses Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque, and the employee company that allegedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government,” Pai told the Handelsblatt.
Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the U.S. government, and he was also in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the U.S. government.
Chemistry factory in northern France burns: schools closed
At night, local residents hear explosions. A giant fire wall lights up the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleanup could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and cr<0xC3><0xA8>ches in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open on Friday as a precautionary measure, the responsible prefecture informed. The Interior Ministry had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals indoors, protect their food and stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that after the deletion, smell spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 policemen and gendarmes were in use at the fire site.
A giant black smoke column had previously ascended from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs, according to the authorities, to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples at first. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. In the river dams were built against the pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire erupted early in the morning around 02.40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany has to invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to make the necessary decisions."
Acting would have to be done by those states that have budgetary leeway for more investments, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, referring to the high national debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. The French national debt must be "stabilized" and "reduced", Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments to revive the European economy, and in return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to deal with its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
Among other things, the French government is responding to the protests of the Yellow Vests movement, which is expected to drop the new debt to 2.2 percent, as expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson renounces question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes the "capitulation law" passed by parliament.
Parliament is back, a law dictates to the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician does not address this possibility.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains concerned about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit, despite the last law passed by Parliament, which is exactly what is supposed to prevent that. On a corresponding question, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would comply with applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement has been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use “political harassment” to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law to the post-EU exit. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. “We are confident that leaving the EU on October 31 is one way to go.”
Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said he felt the political clashes around Brexit as a “walk in the park” and was confident that the EU’s intended exit would come true: “We are enjoying this, we are going to win, we are going to leave the EU, don’t worry,” Cummings told the British newspaper.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as the chief strategist in the UK's Downing Street government seat, and is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has put the prime minister in a seemingly hopeless situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (pockets) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the illustrated book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September, including Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a committed artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, some hundred of which are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the center: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, phones in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unformed moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the headlights on her farm in southern England or in Scotland also led a very normal life. So Mary McCartney told the BBC that she had always slept with the old one as a baby.
Like hardly any other medium, the poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The shots of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It’s about the deciding click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at the exact right moment,” said Paul McCartney. “If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo.” And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing exactly the right moment. “She just knew she had it,” Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the cut-out and the colours make "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but besides all the anecdotal, it is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes look like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly released Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was released exactly 50 years ago.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.”
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from its neighbouring country despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published Friday that Turkey cannot stop imports of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems with importing Iranian oil, as some companies had “withdrawn because of the US threats.”
Nevertheless, Turkey “will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues,” said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of “maximum pressure” against the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and in recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have exacerbated significantly.
U.S. government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically limit the reception of refugees. The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which is a cut of 40 percent.
The U.S. Department of State said that while the U.S. would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are therefore in danger, as indicated by the Foreign Ministry's statement, while a maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be welcomed from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The program, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and relocates them to the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program’s history. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was just under 85,000.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, which would further damage the United States’ leadership role in protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the U.S. – legally and illegally. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Comes Close to a Spike"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage in the whistleblower affair. Whoever has given appropriate hints to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power, "comes close to a spy," Trump said according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York.
Accordingly, Trump spoke in front of staff of the U.S. UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This comes close to a spy." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spies and treason, we used to deal with it a bit differently now."
Observers assessed the latter's remark on a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats sharply criticized Trump's statements and accused him of intimidation from witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment process against him, wrote the chairs of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Supervision Committees in the House of Representatives.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now published complaint of having misused his office to request interference from another country in the 2020 U.S. election. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer. In the conversation, Trump advises him to initiate any misconduct against his possible democratic bias.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informant are, but as reported by the New York Times, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst of the CIA’s foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat downed: baby and toddlers drown in Aegean Sea
Over and over again, people are trying to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. The boats are often too small. Seven migrants have been killed in the demise of an inflatable boat, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the sinking of an inflatable boat. Among the dead were a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in far too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who breaks off concert
A U.S. concert by rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end due to an awkwardness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. On the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it while it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for apology and added that Daltrey "can't really talk now". The audience promised Townsend to get at his expense at a reparation concert, but an appointment is not yet fixed.
The Who canceled performances scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver to be picked up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear for billions of dollars in revenue.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had just a few days ago dismissed founder Adam Neumann as head, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for the executives to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the UK's "Financial Times" reports that WeWork's immediate leases were suddenly closed.
WeWork leases large office space in the long term and rents it out in short term in partly small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has burned money with this business at a staggering rate. Last year, the company suffered a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year, the total loss is estimated at 2.5 billions of new spaces.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now signed leases with maturitys of up to 15 years, resulting in liabilities of more than $40 billion, which could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, nearly 300,000 square meters of office space over the past 24 months. WeWorks renewal contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the areas newly launched at that time, and in the same time, it was the best office location in the United States.
Even in the UK capital, the balance in the real estate market could shift noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis, bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have rebuilt their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off a part of the expected billions of revenue. Access to the reserves of WeWork - which are scarce anyway - they have not, despite the long-term rental agreements. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually based in a separate subsidiary.
Russia once again detained many North Korean fishermen
In the past few days, a total of 262 poachers have been arrested who have been illegally fishing in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told the agency Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them injured. This time there had been no injuries, it said. The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters, where the coast guard of Russia is driving patrols to protect their marine biological resources according to its own information. The re-checks were 30,000 octopus fish were discovered. In addition, according to the information, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and arrested to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok in 2018, according to the agency Ria Now.
The Russian fisheries authority had not issued fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there for some time in 2019, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also recently complained of high ecological damage from the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these even small living creatures would be brought out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need 200 years to dispose of the technical regulations.
Three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the arrests last week, according to Moscow. One also wounded North Korean died later, according to the FSB, from his injuries. On that 17 September, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened the fire.
U.S. bans former president Castro
The U.S. has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro and his children. The U.S. Department of State justified this in a communication on Thursday with Castro’s involvement in “gross human rights violations”. As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he faces a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As leader of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased leader of the revolution, Fidel Castro, was also convicted of human rights violations there by supporting the president of Venezuela, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro. "The disregard of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," Pompeo tweeted.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump issued a ban on entry to Venezuela, including members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The US has imposed a whole series of sanctions on Maduro’s government to force him to kneel and help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaid<0xC3><0xB3> to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of Maduro’s closest allies. The Socialist Caribbean Island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of dispatched doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government in repressing government opponents.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement plans to once again host actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. It is likely to start due to the time shift in New Zealand and Australia before the protests move across Europe to North America. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Protesters also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How big the global appeal will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, over four million people streaked for the climate. This Friday, we will do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
Particularly in Germany last Friday, the influx was very large. A good third of all global protesters - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests, according to estimates from Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them, in metropolitan areas such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller towns and cities such as the Westerfalt.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had sat in front of the Swedish parliament in August 2018 in order to call on the politicians of her country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. The Fridays for Future movement emerged within a short period of time. The climate protests are mainly attended by students and students, but increasingly also by scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the impending climate catastrophe, and above all, under the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be curbed to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just over a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high-sea race hunt, where she had most recently participated in climate protests and United Nations summits. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke urgently to the heads of state and government of the world on the basis of the Right Foundation. In her home country, her commitment to the climate was more
Russia bans smoking on balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow told the agency Tass. The ban is to come into force on 1 October.
Those who smoke, however, must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should light a fire, the penalty is higher. According to the Ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Strike against cybercriminals - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time identified a large server provider for illegal business on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach an der Mosel, via which international criminals operated their activities.
This was reported by the Prosecutor General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a major action. The darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
The suspects' customers were said to have been the operators of the world's second-largest darknet drug marketplace, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had smashed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled by a server in the cyberbunker, according to the prosecutor's office.
It was said that such a hoster had been removed for the first time in Germany. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access campaign with the support of special forces such as the GSG9, searches were carried out in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It was the result of nearly five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to go on the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg’s backers?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing is that a 16-year-old girl holds the mirror in front of the power man of that time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and leads young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt like he was chosen to win the race for a fairer world. This young person has made a chance to win the race for a more just world.
But is there a dark side in this regard? Why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold extensively, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also, it was well-proven on the action of Greta Thunberg.
Here the spirits now separate: Is it morally right to be financially enriched in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue action? No matter which position is ultimately involved, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to criticize certain trends from behind.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Through Our Solar System
A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The astronomers’ assumptions have confirmed: a foreign comet is currently intersecting our solar system – it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system, named after its discoverer 2I/Borisov, and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked up to the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was spotted while flying through.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch up from close into an alien solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to that of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reports. The comet is clearly of interstellar origin according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic pathway that takes it out of our system.
Comet has been spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before that time comes, astronomers can observe it in detail, because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in its approach, which means that it can be studied from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then only be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Agency explains in a statement.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings on Comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de Le<0xC3><0xB3>n puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets could form in other solar systems through similar processes as in ours, de Le<0xC3><0xB3>n's colleague Javier Licandro added.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Only recently, a giant asteroid passed the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson horrified over brother
Boris Johnson becomes more lonely. Only his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges the Prime Minister's warlike language as "tasteless" in clear words. It's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to arm up - at least verbally. At the question hour in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and by now more critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, elongated, quadrupled, tarred and springed". She considers this extremely reprehensible. They do not recognize the version of her brother again, Rachel Johnsons, who had joined the EU Parliament in the elections to the "Anti-Bxi".
In particular, she stumbled upon the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly lower house MP who had been assassinated by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 referendum, whose memory could best be honoured by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the lower house. "It is very tasteless for the people who have been assassinated by a member of the House of Commons," she said.
Cox's widow also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jos' name is used in this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to enter passionately and decisively into what one believes in - no matter what view one is. But one should never "demonicize the other side". He also lamented that an atmosphere had emerged in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. "I've been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it's an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson said.
Johnson’s language has also received sharp criticism in the Church. As reported by the Times, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is “unworthy of this country”. In a joint statement, they stated: “In recent days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside of parliament. We should speak with respect to each other.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is setting a strong mark: in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women appear with Latino roots, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming U.S. Football League NFL final, which the organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I am incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, which has incredible strength in the United States," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2nd. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican.
"I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York City after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer, making her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is highly anticipated in the US every time. This year many also value the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump’s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a stir there. As a rule, over 100 million TV viewers watch the NFL final, it is now also extremely popular in Germany.
Last year, there was political controversy ahead of time. The reason for the dispute was quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise in protest against police violence against blacks when playing the national anthem and had been harshly tackled by US President Donald Trump, among other things. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had been criticized for a Super Bowl appearance by many rockers.
An actor and a YouTuber has appointed Egypt’s ruler: Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad for the time being.
The two men who have influence on whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt, the presidents of the two countries have spent the last week in the foreign countries. One of the two of the presidents of Egypt, President Abdelfattah al-Sisi, returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 lost the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first free elected head of state of the country, told the President of the United States, had spent hundreds of the time in the New York.
Deceiving - this, according to the president of the other man who currently determines what is happening on the streets. Mohamed Ali remained of course abroad, where he deprived himself of the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old as an actor was known only to a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the leading voice of the country's Tea House,
He goes directly to the head of state and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president revels in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it is said there. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because in his second job as a construction contractor for 15 years, he seems to know at least the exact impression of what he is talking about.
After last week, for the first time since Sisi's grip on power, thousands of protesters had protested against his rule and nearly 2,000 people were arrested. At first, protesters, among them prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, called for a "million march" for this Friday. That really so many people would venture onto the streets, it was unlikely that there would be any protesters in the streets. But there were some protesters in the police,
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters ripped off banners with the portrait of the president last week, a massive police presence was reported here on Friday. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and on the roads down. In Cairo, several underground stations in the city center were closed because of "maintenance works", the most roads around the Tehrplatz were torn down by the Muslims, and the people were to blocked to the streets in 2011.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers", but as a retractor that is not to be understood: "All Egypt is Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
Anyone who concludes an internet contract does not need to trust the speed data of the providers blindly. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved in the event of any abnormalities.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Centre.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options: For example, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the providers are carried out in accordance with provider-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," states the Bavarian Consumer Centre on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised service.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and, under certain circumstances, also claim damages.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are being determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the president's impeachment affair before action can lead to impeachment.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden for “for years.”
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump for the whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort because of it. Scott’s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump’s policies on several occasions, such as against easing environmental protection regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man Remains in MCU: Another Marvel Movie Planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man would no longer be part of the Avengers universe. It was completely unclear how the films around Tom Holland would continue.
After Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home, Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which several U.S. media report agreeing, according to which the film is scheduled to launch in the U.S. from July 16, 2021.
In "Screenrant" magazine, Marvel boss Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I'm delighted that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. Me and everyone at the Marvel studios are extremely pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He's the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony will continue to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But what happens to the sudden good news? Supposedly Sony Marvel has made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also includes Marvel, would participate with 30 percent of the proceeds of upcoming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the big finale in the US. In the last episode, there were many happy endings and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked in the series for many years, were paid tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following sections included spoilers to the series finale.
One thing to anticipate: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finals for a last goodbye as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives showed the most memorable scenes with the Duchess of today, such as the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she greets him after his detention.
When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) walks straight to the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit, but when he does not want to know about it, he does not want to make a statement about his suit.
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
One baby and four other children were drowned in a refugee boat in the Aegean. Seven people died in the accident, the Greek Coast Guard said on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wants to "inform Turkey about the refugee situation", said Seehofer on Friday, and then wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens, in order to help cope.
On Friday, a spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed Seehofer’s planned trip with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, according to the Greek Civil Protection Ministry on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased numbers have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants illegally coming to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take in a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
On the Greek side, however, the processing of asylum applications is difficult due to a lack of personnel. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, almost 29,400 people live on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The worst is the situation in Lesbos: In a camp with capacity for 650 people, currently 5,200 migrants are housed.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 have there been so many, the state broadcaster reported.
Climate Change: Heat Leads to More Heart Attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. The climate change is "very certain" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology. In particular, the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and large temperature jumps to create within a short time and led to people suffering from heart disease.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photo breakdown
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Greens boss holds a reusable cup in his hand in a photo, but now came out: The cup has been manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee mug with metal straw has never held Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, in her hand. On the party's website she was seen in a photo with this mug, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published before, and was also reported to the media as a Canadian mug.
Greens chief has to answer for photo breakdown
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party is producing fake news in order to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection", and this in the middle of an election campaign for the lower house election, in which it is also increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked the discussion about fake news. One user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens are manipulating a photo of their chairman to hide their disposable cup".
May was shocked and insisted on her blog that she did not know anything about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, talking to citizens, had a cup in her hand. However, she correctly put it, it was made of bamboo. She always had it there. A spokeswoman for the party said that it was only about taking a photo of the party logo in the picture.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she tells the Guardian, and at the same time asks for something from her overstated team: "If they want to edit a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also fallen into shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - however, their pictures were not photographed. Thus, the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer Wants Free Upgrade: Lifetime Flight Ban on Cathay
Jaqueline Ng allegedly received an upgrade from Cathay Pacific via email, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board – and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-proclaimed influencer actively asked Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the outbound flight, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, even though she had presented an email in which her Cathay Pacific allegedly offered an upgrade. The letter seeks to have the influencer received from a marketing employee of the airline, while the airline accuses Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK airport were skeptical: they crocheted at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail supposedly originated, disputed the email contact with Jaqueline. This also did not confirm the mail system in which the mail was sent.
Airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines Ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific, for $1,400 (about $1,280) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had reimbursed her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. The airline’s terms and conditions also state that she does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this – and now hires a lawyer.
Oil prices drop after report on ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Lastly, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea variety Brent cost $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
A report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen was reported to have approved a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities had brought down five percent of global oil production. The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in Yemen’s civil war country had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia blames Iran as the U.S. government does. A ceasefire would alleviate political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, one can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the commodity strategy department at Saxo Bank, Bloomberg news agency.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent nearly $65.
Recently, Bloomberg reported, citing insiders, that after the attack in mid-September, repairs to oil plants in Saudi Arabia are progressing faster than expected, with production again reaching a volume of eight million barrels per day and moving back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there have been multiple press releases citing insiders reporting on rapid progress by state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work, but commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after being detained by Iran and the recent release on the way to leaving the port. The crew is now preparing to leave while the ship is still anchored, shipping chief Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell told the Swedish radio on Friday morning.
The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had driven oil prices up significantly in the past few weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
In the affair of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, cover-up allegations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials have made intense efforts to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a disputed phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. An anonymous whistleblower told the House.
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that a third summit in the nuclear dispute will soon be held by Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump, and the sense and prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing the agreements of the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the agency KCNA.
The U.S. has so far done nothing to implement the previous year’s summit’s resolutions, North Korea’s foreign ministry adviser said. He also criticized tightened U.S. sanctions and the joint military manoeuvres of the U.S. and South Korea, but he hopes for a “wise” and “courageous” decision by Trump to come back to a rapprochement.
Trump said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he agreed to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, the two then agreed to meet again in the demilitarized zone, but the big successes between the two Korean states have so far been resuscitated.
Prince Harry: Gun manufacturers to help mine clearance
In Angola, the British Prince Harry symbolically ignited and destroyed an explosive mine with a blue splinter protection vest. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he established the ignition circuit. At a safe distance the explosive body exploded. With a view to getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he did not call for the help of the countries that were later on the running TV cameras:
Pounds under Pressure - Interest Rate Reduction Expected
British Pound Under Pressure
In the face of an early rate cut, the pound is losing value over the euro.
Frankfurt speculated that the Bank of England (BoE) would soon cut interest rates against the pound sterling, and the British currency fell by up to 0.4 percent to $1,2269 on Friday.
The sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who brought a cut in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as uncertainty will affect the UK economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, as Saunders is considered an advocate of restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the brokerage.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy due to the Brexit hack, without directly signaling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU if necessary without a divorce agreement by 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British prime minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow analysis lab is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's integrity chief of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the World Championship in Athletics, new details of the doping scandal in Russia are revealed - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had gained back at the beginning of the year and even only on its own. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports had been revealed. After this, the Russian football team had blocked the Russian anti-doping agency (Russia) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee left after individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio. In February 2018, around 270 athletes of the country competed in the sports under a neutral flag.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada repealed the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the correct data," David Howman said in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The athletics federation is the only organization to hold on to Russia’s ban. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes under a neutral flag started. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergo testing.
Earlier this week, the Wada had already put manipulations in the room and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks, now threatening the renewed ban on Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
