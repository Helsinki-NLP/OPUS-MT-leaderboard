A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama’s Re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by reaffirming that election fraud in the U.S. is less common than the number of people killed by lightning strikes.
Republican lawyers have reported only 300 cases of electoral fraud in 10 years in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for conducting the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of U.S. governments have been promulgating new laws since 2009 that complicate the process of registering or passing the ballot.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for premature voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on Election Day, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a court file is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state asked voters to show a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are seen as voters who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID card issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations, who vote more strongly for the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state had requested proof of citizenship for the electorate.
Arizona was the first state to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
It is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in eight states in 2011 promoted laws that abolished the registration of voters on Election Day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the general elections of 2004 helped to register about 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the share of registration of new voters in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for premature voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they make up only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same goes for the Hispanic population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, the whites, who represented 76% of the voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the decisive states for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes shows incorrect results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater hesitation of the already undecided men for carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have obtained the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the US, there were numerous interfering factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that following follow-up after 12 years, the likelihood of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40, if you have a direct relative who has already developed prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin also have a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options where prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not impair the quality of life in the long run, and in these cases one is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are suggested to have active monitoring and offer treatment when the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should and who should not be treated are determined with increasing accuracy.
Therefore, I still recommend carrying out the test.
However, the most important thing is to talk to your doctor to determine if he should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that enables the evaluation of the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle remedy to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, that would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is believed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously harms people’s health.
“There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,” André Beaulieu said.
Encouraging data: 10 years after renunciation of the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, intestinal, gastrointestinal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against intestinal cancer,” he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of developing a grime or gastrointestinal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found that reducing the risk of prostate cancer was more likely to increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preoccupation.
"Doing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has caused a certain sensation last summer, and for good reason.
It is indeed believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model – our best or “least wrong” explanation of nature and the behavior of matter – but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for the physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but data is still missing to be completely safe about it.
Nevertheless, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of deceiving oneself, and let’s look at what it’s about.
There is an unavoidable law in this world that prevents two objects from being in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too strongly as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: the Pauli’s exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same “quantum state”, whereby this “state” is broadly composed of some of its properties.
On this basis, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and who kindly obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons move, an evil gang of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred - in any case not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which by the way is absolutely amazing) these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disrupted" at exactly this location, in a way like a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" for this boson to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a bit comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be feared by a very large rock.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is required – the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! – to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator by itself.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass.
For what can all these researches be "good," Ms. Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to accurately examine all the differences between the observations and predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stuff some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great flaws, as it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of these researches on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there are none.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle – who worked at the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous-stroke laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 – has already told us that the laser was initially considered more of a “laboratory play.”
You can imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With its Committee on "Death in Dignity," Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared.
However, there is still much work to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that devoured him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the palliative care home of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he resignedly agrees to let himself be helped with dinner.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to cure my diarrhea because it is humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing while standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some.
"It depends on the person's ability to take a step back," he notes.
In the opinion of several people who work in palliative care, large events take place amidst these regressions.
Patients enrolled in the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who take care of them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die “consciously and by suffocation”.
But because of the disease, I really got to know my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I don’t have any wishes in life anymore,” she says before accepting that a mask should be put on to help her breathe.
In the next few days, however, she expects a last visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers offer personal care and assistance with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more enjoyable.
In Quebec, there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 people.
That's very little if you take into account that one day we'll all die.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with brandy or pepsi, as desired.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," says Nursing Director Nathalie Savard.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, there is no day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years who enjoys the last family gathering in the yard and is well supported by his pillows, while striking in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, tragically dies after trying everything to survive.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been filled with cancer patients under the age of 45,” Martel said.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to a care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Montreal area, are more or less exclusively specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great insufficiency in Quebec’s healthcare that causes several doctors specializing in palliative care to look forward to passing a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting death.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain, without any measures being taken to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they don’t receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst prognosis, forbidding until the last day.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued heavy chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop treatment, she replied that she regretted giving up the fight, she told me.
But she told me I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not fulfilling this wish after their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care of the Society of Home Palliative Care of the Montreal area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in either sporadically or permanently putting the patient to sleep until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to put me to sleep,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Every day, road construction officials, major construction companies, fundraisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell us what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosos are involved.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has been disintegrated since drastic measures have been taken," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of Montreal police.
The scandal was uncovered by him following an in-depth investigation into the misappropriations associated with the Quebec road construction contracts, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he stressed, “the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars in the contracts,” because some restrained their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission “has already brought down two mayors,” he adds, hoping that it will succeed in “showing the tactics behind the individuals.”
Established in 2011, a permanent anti-corruption unit
Established in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit is also making great efforts with its troops on the government’s auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau Force", which since 2009 has caused the "canalization cartel" of Montreal to proceed more restrained in the artificial bloating of the treaties...
In recent weeks, she has carried out house searches in a number of rows and charged charges of fraud and corruption against municipal mandate holders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received lubrication money in exchange for public contracts.
Incidentally, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly charged.
The latter has caused a stir by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
He himself paid for several years 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mafia-related mediator who transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito had his hand everywhere in the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Drainage contracts whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games from the construction company, as well as bribes in the amount of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they let themselves be lubricated by artificially inflating the invoices with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his cash with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first deputies to raise the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she rebelled against the sale of a community property purchased for $5 million and resold to developers in the booming real estate market in 2010.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says that it "draws on a thread that allows to understand the functioning of the system infiltrated by ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the guilty."
She says the procedure is “painful, but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we would need an investigative unit only for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officers have stolen several hundred million dollars", but most of all thinks about the role of "the mandate holders who are in the picture about the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting from a 70% share of black money in funding the Quebec election campaign, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak slack of reality."
The Quebec government proposes limiting donations to parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "As long as election campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be circulating in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story is detrimental to the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to take a look at their own backyard...
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress on their side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And with a game, it’s even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings at the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new additions this summer are used to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This leads to a player like me having to stand up and do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti respects all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in the Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he placed in me is also an explanation of my accomplishments.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken us the top spot.
But we're lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: in this way we qualified for the 16th final.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak our word against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can play the return game of the 16th final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means to ensure that this project takes on concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year it is really important for us to squeeze this title.
Last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to take the win.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be a champion with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot of us are expected.
We fully accept this.
However, if we win 4-0 in a home game against Troyes, and you still find something to blame for, that’s certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people still expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to create a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
We have proven strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, a club that hasn’t managed to qualify for the 16th final in two seasons and has also made huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to have a 15-point lead at the break!
This meant that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winners and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the more so that one speaks of a "zlatan dependence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart’s desire to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from hitting out some game time.
I've seen things out there that made me stronger.
Today I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teaching, and today we have to show exemplary behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages them to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the draw forced in Spain on 16 October (1:1) an opening match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone is committed to everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
Bitcoin allows you to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, shaped by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After Bitcoin’s price peaked at $30 ($23) in June 2011, it dropped to $2 five months later, before recovering at around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as “the virtual currency with the greatest success,” “competing with the dollar or euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes trade back) by playing.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and handled by a central authority each time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of the billing book, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data associated with this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the billing book of public accounts spread throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a sort of interim central banker, having the privilege of adding that additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay for cheating twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without a link because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task will receive 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but divisible up to a hundred millionth, leaving a certain amount of leeway.
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol,” assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real-money payment company and the network uses Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Major actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the billing book and showed that nearly 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
A "mega final sale" was launched in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are reconsidered in favour of more horizontally aligned systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
Incidentally, the ECB’s report proposes to reassess the various risks that are highly regarded today in the event of success of this currency.
We have moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to retake possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we punished Afghan farmers by seeing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there as Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoys flown over by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of the Taliban into Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overrun by war due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
Their takeover of power was then seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to date.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by confiscating government land to sell it as a construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the massive American subcontracting.
They were in disrepute, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fighting.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who were able to take advantage of American subsidies: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
There is an army now.
Are the authorities under whose command they will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization by the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which has existed since the 1964 constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams do not exist and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country that was undermined by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan has immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, have international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) make their excavations at the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s main employers.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' gymnasiums, French Institute of Universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages, and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to win the "hearts and spirits" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aids and offensive actions.
These works, which required many local workers, have helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural lands.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help improve local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2000 meters.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which according to their own statements is their wish, the continuation of less, more well-controlled and directly related civil aid would be necessary in their favor.
A Constitution with a Breaking Rod in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever in terms of the Constitutional Declaration granting it unlimited power of attorney, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt has now been relying on a provisional text that has been amended several times for almost two years, weakening institutional stability and leading to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only led to an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "step the law with his feet."
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, forcing the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text to the Egyptians section by section.
For the president, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
After reaffirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this resort to a hasty vote: "either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of attorney", the latter should supposedly come to an end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constituent assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals did not comply with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned their backs on the idea that they were unable to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
11 people, deputy members, were added in all haste to achieve the decision-making capacity yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
Incidentally, commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed at the time of prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the commuting clock of the Constituent Assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all the attention, remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The liberals, who see this only as a propaganda strike, reciprocate.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place via other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in mind, which grants the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is alarming, as "the persons invited to comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university is far less moderate than the current one.
“There is no concrete religious commitment at the moment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system,” said Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He acknowledges, however, that "there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, reference is made to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised of the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized for the far-reaching powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In line with the military's wish, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have demanded.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no more article refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak out on TV last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comforts and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons to visit Israel.
Bend in front of the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding celebration, walking on the water, the calming of the seastorm and fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the shrines are in Jerusalem.
Believers will follow the Path of Suffering or the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the church of the tomb on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, in the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the Western Wall, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave there papers with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Take a trip up the hill
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in A.D. 25.
They lie on a rocky wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings an aerial cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the mountaintop.
Visiting unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in rock caves in the Judean desert are kept, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is a collection of works by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the monument to the children, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are resounding.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for health
The three most important recreational areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21°C and the air warms up to 23°C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathing all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea, located 417 meters below sea level, is the lowest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salinity and therefore wears even non-swimmers without problems on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt brine) and medicinal sludge as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to calm stressed nerves.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
These secrets lie in the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city was the famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
Fortune is said to be hold to all who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo appointments.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre now hosts evening concerts and operas.
List of tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip you prefer not to take in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which is enough including a change for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is at rest.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, shed-free fish and food that includes both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (made with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls made from pureed beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this there are many well-nourished cats who stroll comfortably and untroubled through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like busy places and don’t say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Entrance tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa requirement on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Mighty" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MEPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
On 1 December, a law came into force that required every migrant worker to take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this regulation only applies to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers over time, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
Not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for obtaining and renewing the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Purpose, problem and protection of rights
The entire examination body will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the press several times before the law came into force: What does it actually bring?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills bring, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, migration agency spokespersons are concerned with reducing the number of forced labourers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," said Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency's representation in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must be protected before you leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems are encountered by migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably meet people with evil intentions who will put him in a dark, narrow barrack under the pretext of help, where he will endure with dozens of months of his own without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In the home, you are promised one, and upon arrival, you will be cheated, their passports will be taken away and not receive the promised salary," confirms the head of the labour migration department of the Tajik migration agency, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't grumble, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, admit that they can not only not master the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford a reasonable primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to make money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
“You feel humiliated and inferior.”
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect regarding the law.
Only migrants with legal status must take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers continue to reside illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Access prohibited for unauthorised persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and this results in cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
"Just don't shy away from cost of false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be fake.
Some counterfeit certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The counterfeit papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to be able to save himself from the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That’s more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and civil rights activists agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test the first time they get time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Interior Ministry Ignores Illegal Weapons Market
Proportion of legal weapons in crimes extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten up the gun laws for private gun owners.
The authorities react to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the assassination of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradov.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age of possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the arms law would be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter has been published on the Internet, the authors of which – representatives of various arms associations – demand the authorities to refrain from “senseless exacerbations”.
The percentage of crimes involving registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Vasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the Interior Ministry’s statistics, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in 2012 over the course of six months, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from using the black market.
According to the authors, you can find every possible weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, tells a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranez said.
On the second channel come illegal weapons that are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons that have been stolen from both the police’s armaments and directly from law enforcement officials.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps there were often explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons," the former military official said.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
“Today, there are countless private armament factories that do not stand up to international competition and, therefore, throw away arms on the black market, for example in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production of its own, sometimes handicrafts, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," the former military official explains.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was published by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
The majority of the illegal weapons come from the army and legal protection authorities, according to the investigators.
Half of all the weapons on the black market are there due to the "debt of those responsible who have to deal with weapons in their work," the report said.
According to the researchers’ data, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% are due to theft in weapons production, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun shop who does not want to be named assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been bought by no one since they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for merchants to obtain supplies in a weapons warehouse.
A gun, for example a TT-type pistol, is purchased via a ensign.
The weapon is displayed and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros each with two magazines," he says.
“Police, of course, know about everything and, therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan to detect crimes, make periodic check purchases from merchants who offer illegal weapons,” the sales consultant adds.
"Like in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find each other most often via acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested coming to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me to bring me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
I only learned the price of the gun there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and meet with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets out that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even coming to some hit rings about an acquaintance I trust.
He gives me the rings just because he knows I'm not pissing him off.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranez tried himself in the mid-1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was depicted.
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” the military officer recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, I drive into the forest with the seller, and there we set a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the gun has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert said.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are needed, nor are there any personal meetings.
"You just need the right amount of money," the ad says on the website "Buy a fighter gun or rifle".
There, users place your orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," user asks "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are going to go up to the service.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military officer Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The controllers accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a cash machine.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the gun's hiding place," the press spokesman for the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow reported.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can finally go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are going to go up to the service.
“People come like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal,” he says.
A Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts say, prices are expected to range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by middle-range overseers.
According to official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences across Russia decreased by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
U.S. fast food and supermarket workers strike
One in four U.S. teens is sitting behind Mc Donald’s box office at some point
Over the past few days, there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon get out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food employees, the protest organizers pursue the goal of founding trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, where sales were held in the U.S., attracting millions of customers, sometimes leading to handcuffs.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, dropped their jobs and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, raided the chain’s branches targeting low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply only because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or handheld scanners.
Participants in the protests on “Black Friday” demanded wage increases and expressed their anger over the fact that the contribution to the company’s own health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raises the average wage to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That’s about 1.1% more than they are now donating for wages.
If Walmart were to shift wage increases completely to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, this would be a yearly surplus of only 12.39 dollars compared to today’s surplus spending.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that there were only protests in nine states and these did not cause any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and in that period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's spokesperson, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post website that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had dropped the work and the protest action was merely "another PR trick" by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their targets were not Walmart stores (which are not desirable in this progressive city and therefore so far inexistent), but McDonald’s and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too high, and on average, their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No one deserves less than she does in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get along with so little money in New York is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. teenagers were behind the counter after school at McDonald’s, but the teenagers were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there for longer.
Now in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to cope with this pay and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a commentary in the Wall Street Journal’s forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don’t know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs from fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate governance from standing in the way of this goal and warning or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff fluctuation.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a lunchtime meeting in front of McDonald's in Times Square where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councillor Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet you're not granted sick days, and you're not paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food employees so they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, not all of whom are employed by far in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be moderately overwhelmed so far"
The theme of augmented reality, popular with fans of modern technologies, has recently been typically perceived by the lens of a special pair of glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
Speaking to the leader of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses for the company’s scientists were only a transit station.
It excites the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched as well.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are an advance, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect anymore, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What can we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, a lot is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output not yet decisive.
We try to change this, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much more easily.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It’s popular, but isn’t it overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone around about its actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in their particular niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and scarce gestures instead of elaborate gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- For example, we'd ask you to give me this can?
They say it and point to it at the same time.
- Normally I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does this mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and cannot afford at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that we will have to work in the near future on developing new sensor types that will allow us to capture people’s reactions more accurately.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
Not only the resolution along the X- and Y-axis, but also along the Z-axis must be taken into account.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of humans are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps are not enough, especially for gestures.
In our laboratory in Redmond, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with a controllable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work, I needed exactly such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or increase the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that with regard to the application of advanced reality technology in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand while on the go, but I think the best option would be a "changing" augmented reality, where we could switch from glasses to smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and therein lies their strength (private can only see you), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality using glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible reaction!
Your hands feel nothing at all.
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often mention that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection support.
She perceives pressure excellently!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "pictures in the air" something handy, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is, creates a feeling that is currently as weak as someone blowing over the palms.
There are also ligaments for the wrist that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Did you try to outwit the brain?
Do you think it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to deal with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain is only moderately overwhelmed, and there are still many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so appealing for a researcher: With many topics, we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
The selected list already included high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city’s borders and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red, who is sometimes found at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburgian social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street conjures a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and ensures a good mood in them.
Recently, he grabbed a spinning organ and became a Petersburg spinning organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that deviates somewhat from the grey norm causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to get into conversation with people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Kulturpalast Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I knew I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonevschina"; this resulted in "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was over.
I am attracted to theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything except literature.
It was important to me to be at the center of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemians, the House of the Petersburg Bohemians, until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazz, and I also remember how Schnur got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight jerseys and included today’s popular composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have their origins in the art clinic.
Our staff and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, there was a poll in the press about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and so I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my paintings are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and makes me afraid to be like that.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by dictating that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and focuses on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But maybe you can't give a man's hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
We recently saw you as an urban organist, and a cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful too?
- These days, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- The performances of Stas Mikhailow come but several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is ruined.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such paintings, which even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It says: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that’s something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real tsars, because the tsars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
There are good advisors in Moscow right now.
In Petersburg, we have some that might be the experts, but they are blocked the way, because it takes higher-ranking experts to properly evaluate the first ones and clear the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same goes for Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art can grow hard on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the City of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthmen on board are looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the important question is how can we reproduce in gravitylessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the research associate of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at great heights or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first dealt with the question of reproduction in space with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of orbital-bred peas did not differ in the slightest from Earth’s species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must be able to stand on its legs and begin to move," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without a solid surface, the chicks swarmed wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn completely dulled.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Twice we let chicks hatch and then set the whole thing up because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev for the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only contain same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats were given offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive instincts.
In contrast to animals, humans could do that in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Out of ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was in Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even performed work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Waleri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The hydro lab in the cosmonauts' preparation center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even though adults find water pleasant, it is a strange environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders were bearing witness to the fact that life on land came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in amniotic fluid for about 9 months in the mother’s belly, and that it can then become more easily accustomed to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swim only 2 weeks pass.
"That's too little time to forget something," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
So, while weightlessness is a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman cannot do without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles recede enormously quickly and thus the ability to squeeze the child out decreases.
All right, let's bypass the birth-initiating aids.
For example, birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth’s formation, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
In orbit, a newborn child cannot be put into a training suit like an adult.
He will simply lack what is essential to his life.
"This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to give birth to a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person," predicts Igor Pestow, head of the RAN's Bioethics Commission on Medical-Biological Problems.
So far, the birth of children in space is merely a theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when the Earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships break up to a distant planet that will be the home for their offspring born in space.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> chief: Control of the black system fails due to political debt
The Czech Republic has good control authorities and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but falls short of their application.
Speaking for Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvy<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD> controlen<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC3><0xBA><0xC5><0x99>ad, NK<0xC3><0x9A>), Miloslav Kala, said this.
"A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied correctly - and I don't think this is the case with us," Kala said.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German examiners.
As a negative practical example, he leads the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls – is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the president of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is to control the observance of the law, hinders in its activity," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries regarding public contracts were compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a question of the European legislatures defining how to handle public contracts. This is what national legislation is built on, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We compared all this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we were able to find extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws are perhaps even a little more "strengthened and perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again. One must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project be a help to you? What results from this project for you?
It is precisely such a joint control that could help us to stop constantly striving for the perfection of laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal as well.
Perhaps it is even that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paperwork", and those who are looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems with the practical implementation of the Czech Public Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NK<0xC3><0x9A> or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9A> is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar in structure to ours and also has a college, which is merely formed slightly differently.
The competencies are also comparable to some extent, but Germany is a state, i.e. there are these accounts in the individual states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the state accountants.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, although one can certainly not say that Germany is better in everything.
Is it because the inspectors are better?
Not so, but as I said, I don’t like comparisons like that.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a role model for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn’t have any kind of cooperation with our agency, would they?
With regard to Czech legislation, how important was the amendment of the Procurement Act to your authority, do you feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an effect on our tests.
Since our checks take place retrospectively, you have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we are more likely to feel the impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - for example, we have introduced the new control tool "Detection of risks of uneconomics" and with it almost 14,000 public contracts will be examined and analyzed - here, of course, the changes will have an impact as thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positively, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "strengthened" and can no longer be adhered to.
Under the previous rules, persons subject to audit are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational regional policy programme, the Regional Council) to the effect that any non-compliance with the public procurement law is a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to make the law even more stringent?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system merely puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let’s say which path is not effective.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS would not burden the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the president of the government cannot simply come and hinder the control office, whose duty is to control the observance of the law.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we're pretending to be nothing.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely due to form defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think is missing from us.
On the roads, there are some ice sheets, but they are mostly dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice smoothness.
However, the roads are predominantly easy to travel, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary the roads were easy to navigate this morning, some snow and ice smoothies prevailed.
Temperatures fell to -5 to -10°C, during the day it should be slightly warmer.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, there is about 30 cm of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the roads of the first road class in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is required, for example, on bridges on which the roads are sometimes icy and smooth.
All traffic routes of the second and third class roads, including the mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, ice or extended snow remains remain in sections.
In particular in the higher positions, increased attention is therefore required.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is danger because of ice, in higher altitudes and in the mountains there is sometimes still an extended layer of snow on the roads, informs the road and highway directorate on their websites.
The roadmasters warn drivers of ice smoothing, which can occur especially in higher locations in the Pardubice district.
Ice smoothness can be found in particular on roads of the second and third class in the districts of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies at altitudes on the streets of the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or serene, and it remains mostly rainy.
Temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, a gentle wind blowing.
Pilsen (district)
Today, the roads in the district of Pilsen are easy to navigate, but local attention is needed, and the driving style has to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can come to ice smoothing on the roads.
Nebula is also expected to occur locally, but the visibility will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the district road masteries.
The D5 motorway is practically unlimited, but increased attention is recommended by the roadmasters between the 80th and 131st kilometers.
The first-class roads are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice can be smoothed in sections.
The roads of the second and third class roads are moist, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be especially careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc
Today, drivers who are heading towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district have to reckon with snowmatch.
After the use of scattered vehicles, Schneematsch remains on the pass <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Nocturnal snow drifting forced the roadmasters to use, in the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district fell about 3 cm of new snow, according to the road administration.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually fully accessible.
"In the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district, snow remains remain in the altitudes.
On the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass, drivers have to expect snowshoeing in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," said an employee of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk road administration today to the agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Her colleagues in the Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k district also had to go out at night, according to their data, the roads are free and wet up to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district the roads are fully accessible, but in the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk district drivers have to drive carefully in sections of the forest, as the roads are still damp here.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the roadmasters report several poorly accessible road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.K. is blocked, according to traffic police.
Temperatures remain below zero even at lower altitudes, so that snow and ice will stay on the roads. On the other hand, no problems are reported from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice smoothing is reported in particular from the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from the road I/13 at the border of the districts of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.L. and Liberec.
The blocking of the road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was necessary due to branches pressed from the snow load to the road.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: At our concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people like to start on.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more likely to make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can accumulate enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide fundraising event that we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously from 21:00 in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is said to be about the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us.
From whom did this idea come?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we are handing this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with the purchase of which people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded, together with other performers, the so-called anthem against the sinking of the world, entitled "The sinking of the world".
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube today. Will it also be resounding on the benefit concerts?
Of course, and last but not least, provided that everything works and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem will be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are broadcast live together in a direct connection from Czech TV.
The lyrics of the hymn come from Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, at which we have been working for six years together with the association Tap at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building is to be built, into which we will then move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What criteria did you choose?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have to carry a lot of instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked out without any problems so far, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes wondered already.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travels abroad you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were just in Russia witnessing that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not suitable for people with disabilities, where it is still uncommon when someone is travelling in a wheelchair alone in the city center.
It is not even a matter of course that you leave a wheelchair user in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still a lot of things we hang out in behind...
It should be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular right now, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intense.
And since I myself am a musician and play saxophone, I founded a music company together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, used to say, something has gotten out of control (laughs).
But the band has only been known in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It’s true that working with well-known singers helped us; we also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have come to realize that if one does something and this is not visible to the outside, one’s own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to get it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that things could be handled differently.
In the show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, as all new things are considered with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are few really unique things, and I dare to claim that tap tap is part of it.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is of course compassion; this is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progress for them, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise on many things and you must also demand a certain discipline.
However, I think this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have rehearsals twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm of many quickly goes out.
This is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group. People come and go. You can't stop that.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the predicted sunset, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
The venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected via live circuit and there is a common interpretation of the anthem "The Tap Tap".
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the equipping of a multifunctional, handicapped-friendly educational centre, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency at a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA), making it the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were already engaged in space travel, but they did not always come up with understanding.
I recall, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld’s lecture at the Warsaw Observatory on December 6, 1933, at which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work “The Entrance to Cosmonautics”.
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
<0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, in 1934 for "Eingang zur Kosmonautik".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s world-renowned contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the Earth’s remote side of the Moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for starting or braking the Draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered missiles.
The research was conducted by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents that the research had reached the stage of practical testing.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket by Ing. Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared in the specialist press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was terminated from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Agency (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company.
At the time, there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was foreseeable that exploration of space would have a future.
Already from its beginnings in 1956, the Polish space company PTA sought to join the International Federation for Space, which was founded in 1951, and indeed the PTA became a regular member as early as the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became deputy chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 began flight tests in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w Desert with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Of this rocket, three types were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor 2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth noting that Poland joined the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek.
The repeal of the non-profit work law is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the non-profit work law.
This decision sparked a lively discussion in the public eye.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unrestrained financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (wages), there are price tensions.
This term refers to a condition in which the manufacturer attempts to survive economic competition by importing favourable goods by "undercutting" competition in order to gain a greater market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to relocate their production abroad or buy cheaply there, or to abandon their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparablely high labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is reinforced by the fact that the employers are absolutely reluctant to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the social and economic damage they cause.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates in the individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own populations, regardless of the social consequences, to private capital.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictate of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic compulsion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever greater differences between rich and poor.
For several years now, there have been public food outlets in Germany for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regularly cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state must increase their income to the minimum of living.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU-Southern countries will undoubtedly result in the same state where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a hunger wage on the margins of society, hoping that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
The question arises, of course, where does this capital come from?
When it comes from another EU country, poverty merely migrates from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all, the employees work for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to the point that the state is not allowed to participate in its own economy with capital, and that the planned economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists narrowly on its position that the state must not intervene in the economy in a steerable manner.
Then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual preference, a legislation in which practically everything is punishable, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Ministry, due to lack of finance, commissions private legal companies, closely intertwined with industry, to draft draft laws.
These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal democracies are now rapidly entering a situation as described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in disintegration, and the offices have been occupied by force.
Against lubrication, by illegal slimming of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew unrestrained, and the people went to the polls with already purchased voices" ... "People of character did not apply for offices, so that the state, as a result of this decline, had no consul for eight months" ... "It was already really begun to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be replaced by César's democracy at last, but Appian thought of the strong man in this.
As it turns out, today’s society, as in ancient times, is founded on the ruthless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is by its very nature incapable of recognizing and enforcing the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who are not in the least striving for in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the emergence of fascism and communism in the reckless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today’s standpoint, the demise of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already taking place.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that today’s elites are in complete ignorance of the future possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from the past and the past.
The repeal of the non-profit work law is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state’s participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be none," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, a myriad of reactions.
Some support Israel and argue with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and describe the state of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is the culprit in these recurring waves of killing and who is the victim; in the end, the present-day inhabitants of Israel, including the territories of self-government, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence itself.
It’s about opening the readers a glimpse behind the scenes, a glimpse of who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are especially useful to them.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and emerge from my own understanding of who or which group of people influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can make up an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We have to admit that we live in an age where the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one particularly stands out, which could be called the head of the octopus (I don’t know if someone is standing above them, but I don’t rule this out) – the Rothschilds.
There is not much written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 1990s to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which always stood the consolidation of their power, the propagation of their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they are waging wars or arming themselves on them (before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafi, only four remained, with Russia in the meantime subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; MEP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the 1929 world economic crisis.
The Rothschilds' global cravings for power led to the formulation of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating Europe’s major monarchist states, the second war was to break Britain’s colonial rule in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world’s population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would provide for their conveniences and their luxury and would not consume as many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenism is absolutely leading to the apron).
The method by which the group of the richest families work with the Rothschilds at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to aggravation of the situation (see founding of the FED so that crises such as the ones they triggered in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they had succeeded in triggering the First World War by the murder of Ferdinand, the Habsburg heir to the throne in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian tsarist empire by the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsardom), then the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to be able to spark the Second World War more easily, the bankers had a latent conflict situation created by politics, by occupying Germany with gigantic war repairs; thereby they created the precondition of impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer the Germans a sufficiently strong leader, who called the culprits and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of a German colony, which was also to take a strong role with the Czechos.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke off from the chain that the international bankers had initially held to him, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people, like in World War II, will become victims in the foremost line of struggle, this time together with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with in the beginning the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
One has to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders here, since the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, exclusively elect their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel, the falcon Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-prone, loyal to international bankers politician who does everything in his power to spark a war with Iran, which, given Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly lead to a global conflict over the world’s vast destruction of Iran’s oil, and in which it could quickly come to a global destruction.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-embracing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its conception, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes all the little ones, and the great ones, and the rich ones, and the poor ones, and the free ones, and the bondmen, to give to themselves a mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads, that no one may buy or sell, except they have the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For there is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When It's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had maintained patronage over his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to throw the shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt at hostage liberation only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the embassy was filled, six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover up their true identity – they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff who allegedly visited filming locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the exfiltration expert, Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's collaboration.
For the camouflage to become credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialist magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels change in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly oversized.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men dressed in suits at the meeting table, on the hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable restart of his career with this film.
A smiling actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the Krimi Kein Kinderspiel (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller Stadt ohne Gnade (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film not to play in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The feel for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that made this director’s previous films stand out from Hollywood’s standard.
Affleck, however, also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the entrance sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team also achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
However, with the few, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping out with reality - which then doesn't always look so elegant (the scenes where the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a phone call in America, or also the chase on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide dispersion, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses some traction, a film that can be followed with a certain interest and that can gout the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70s.
However, it is hard to arouse enthusiasm.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history alive to this day in a certain way and as a proof of how exaggerated the notions of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services are.
Guidelines for Inflating Balloons, Bananas and Circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually launches a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to host the "Absurdest Regulation or Idea from the EU Workshop" competition.
“The recent EU plan to introduce a women’s quota of 40% in the management of large European companies led us to this idea,” Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organizing this survey, told the Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding admixture of bioethanol to fuels, which in turn is harmful to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the Directive on the size of chicken cages, which has become considerably more expensive this year.
Criticism in the past also reaped the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks even with a veto threat).
Lobbying interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it only harmonizes the inconsistent national standards that would impede trade.
The EU has already softened the standards for fruit and vegetables against the resistance of some countries by pointing out that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation from last year, which, according to balloons, must be given notice when selling that children under the age of eight may not inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU cited an American study that, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fairground toads.
Curious ideas are also at home
A directive that affects European officials themselves is also relatively absurd - anyone who takes an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, nominated not only the above-mentioned absurdities but also the EU regulation on the extent of food supplies in the field of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food supplies that was allowed to be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day we joined the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volume for mushroom canned, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving grants for applications for grants.
Of course, these ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will apply for a refund to the EU," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest had been very high and the state stocks were overcrowded as a result of so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally came to the Czech Republic so far that it organised a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), in particular should it be funds for the establishment of applications for grants to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily becoming the target of criticism in the Member States, the efforts of the EU to regulate and thus also to improve the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union are, in the opinion of some experts, more worthy of recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced into the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions in this country also evokes the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products, and this struggle does not always win.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum), whose tradition goes back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
The term rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or the Parma ham now also shows the Karlovy Vary, carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or the Saazer hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubice gingerbread or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>icer rolls can boast themselves.
"People want me to save the republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura said.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the Republic being looted for 20 years, thieves roaming freely, while people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don’t like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I’m over 40, and independent and unbiased, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then made your way to the castle.
Don’t you turn your back on your voters?
I've been telling myself all the time that I'm going to start the battle for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I will run for president if I am elected senator.
My goal, however, is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we degrade everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media that want to rob you of your honor and confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed about me that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
You have started the battle for the castle with the thesis of substantive and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you have to change laws.
As president, you have no competences in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I was committed to ensuring that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless person, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from every party what is best for our country without any drawer thinking and party dogmas.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather on the right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it is important that we move forward.
It is not a question of whether anyone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to unite people.
I always publicly support any good approach, even if it comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You dislike it when someone calls you a populist.
But do you not confirm this by what you have just said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach it.
You can call this populism because of me, but all the proposals I have talked about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you have only the key words.
In the long term, you won’t get far in politics.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing substantive and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally enshrine substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And those who are addressed may have to say why they reject this.
A strong personality pointing to abuse can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn’t work, I’ll go back to the private sector in six years.
This sounds a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I alone can’t achieve anything, so I’ve talked to several well-known personalities about whether they want to run for the Senate as well.
For example, I spoke with Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who however refused due to workload.
I also supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who discovered the scam in the trade of light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy on the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of eligible voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
We are only two independents in the Senate.
People have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district leaders.
Are you thinking about creating your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to review the past of any potential party member, and I don’t even have the money for it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign; my transparent account is only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You talk about asset statements, what would yours look like?
I estimate my private assets to be about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another one worth 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million, and an <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb worth about one million, and then I have a few more million on my account.
The Aston Martin, by the way, was a childhood dream - James Bond always liked me, as he was driving in the car, gallant to women and at the same time fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and don’t have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign out of my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live from the senatorial salary alone; so, for example, I could not finance my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur in order to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to go back on those activities?
But this is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I have partially reversed my activities.
For example, my deputy will be managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live from something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As president, however, I would completely stop my activities.

The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the mind - on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby large company, says, "Well, it's nice, the house."
I wonder why we need a library today.
Everyone has internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of these old-style libraries voluntarily today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleep city that hardly needs to be visited at the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-resident community has the lowest educational rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro notes as beautifully brushed reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library had to come!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of the great-know-for-the-bar diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual serenity and appeared for the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury was still stunned looking around and shrugging his armpits, the naughty Maas piled his exquisite gift in size to a pyramid and finished his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So this is it, my suggestion for the Book Mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain is piled up.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless small town retreat, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a staggeringly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory in order to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Book ring orado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the true pleasures of space and reading open up as the topography climbs on foot.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the fired clinker floor and the elegant street lights speak unmistakably the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
People are already looking for park bench, dog and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have turned the classical room configuration upside down and the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and house technology center.
A special joy are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall panelling, sometimes breastfeeding, sometimes stair railings.
Optics, feel and smell are foreign.
Even ingrained architects and civil engineers shake their heads over the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Frisian farm one day.
For many years, a millimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root base in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts for one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimetres thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells like new cars and like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 meter long hike, the Literaturcafé not only rewards you with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and stuffed ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology despite the many glass surfaces," Trouborst says.
It is heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass fall, even on sunny days the sun shines only briefly inside.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand transversely to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, serve as shading and capture much of the sunlight.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, was already daring his way into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "longest overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has gone up.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only for ornament.
With this, MVRDV has succeeded in the royal discipline, which is called identity foundation in the technical jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
No matter how young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
Then Berlin was removed.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Germany, however, must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not believe that it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
It was eventually enforced by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is currently changing its foreign policy, away from a policy managed, so to speak, by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.
What is more, Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still touching on their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy as they have France or Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It demonstrates the willingness to also acquire positions independent of those of the US or European partners in national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers, and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to bump the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to place too much weight on it either, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from voting in important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I believe there is a great deal of understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the US.
That’s why I don’t think this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Maybe Germany will even show some respect.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly advocated a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think the Obama administration secretly has a lot of understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the real differences are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can’t be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is what they do with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will assume a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player – does Germany even want to take a leading role?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not yet used to it, this is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a larger role, various anti-German feelings are released.
That doesn’t make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be receptive to a variety of neighbors and opinions and that’s not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is steadily declining, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else will stay there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's uncomfortable for you and makes you even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Trademark protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a designation officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the originating companies.
Yet it enjoys protection as long as the actual namesake does not complain.
Even then, it is not clear if they are right.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, attorney at law firm Taylor Wessing, who specializes in intellectual property violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters enough to allow them to register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you have Prada-Kny entered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected there, an art name that also used the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and in injuring intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he opposes the fact that Chinese companies are officially granted the right by the Trademark Office to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch said.
"The brand is diluted, the standalone disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are hard to reach and go into the money.
The procedure can last up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court rejected lawsuits because after the long duration of the contested name had become "market truth".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he even has to pay the plagiator money because he violated his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The trade mark office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to too little personnel and room equipment.
In the past year, however, we have "returned from the emergency situation in the work process to normality."
The number of unprocessed opposition proceedings has decreased by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still awaiting completion in the office.
Dealing with it costs a lot
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were taken in fees.
Simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To tackle this costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiator.
The Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was removed.
But the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
One has failed to do so, because in Germany family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office CTMO also rejected the Munich opposition.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the trial opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to be careful hell
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident in bringing the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be estimated, the company archive even had to look through one hundred-year-old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement in vain.
"This shows how much it is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to slip back to Europe.
This is when imitators secure unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the label Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since given up on this business area, yet it has been able to refuse registration.
“You have to be careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, the foreigners "should register anything that is somehow worth protecting in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay the opposite party royalties for their own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aids Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing – and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that crosses far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the tamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers are looking for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - oppress, beguile and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his supple wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the housewife, have arrived.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choral voice has a different text and this in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, the UN’s Unaids program.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
There are 245000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser in Zulu.
In this room no one can speak the Bantu language fluently, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have been succumbed to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, what all of Swaziland suffers from shows itself in the small: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying in their mid-thirties is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who not only lacked parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
If you don’t graduate from school, you don’t have a chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal in the day.
But a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which since then almost professionally takes care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and trippers (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human pappiloma viruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and trippers are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), trippers and human pappiloma viruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is comparatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - nevertheless: Around 20 percent of HIV new infections account for this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human pappiloma viruses are common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
In some cases, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubrication infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and late consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the gagen that the choir sings all over Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, with one of the grandmothers for example.
The Gogos, as they call the old women in Zulu, are the bases of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans with them, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school lessons every day.
If you don’t have anyone, you’ll come to the shelter of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as much as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, one prefers to silence it dead.
A king with 14 wives
“Aids is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In a country where the king officially owns 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms would exist at every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels together every two or three years through the south of Africa, singing songs full of sorrow, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, many of which are still familiar with the southern tip of the black continent from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also squeezed some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godparents.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," people there say.
And if you return the 8733 kilometers of airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then you can see it also shine there.
NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that have struck Mercury.
“No one relates the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet,” said the chief scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Earth’s citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth: small gazeholes in endless expanses.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union definition.
This excerpt of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: The oldest stars can be identified as blue dots, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborns" in the Star Circle Room.
This star-forming region — called unromantic W5 by scientists — has been discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has been captured by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star threw out in the dying process.
In the huge Trifid nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors come to their own better.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebula in this infrared photo looks at the viewer.
It is 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its similarity to an earthly continent gave this nebula the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how these were created is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colour scheme, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three divided, three-split), because dark dust stripes triple the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic karambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If technical abbreviations do not lie, they may call it by their nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the iris nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The fog, which is 1,400 light years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and x-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The Starweighe always produces new youngsters.
Also this star cloud, combined with the rosette nebula, is constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it originated only shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was found predominantly in the universe.
Our Insights into Space: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown larger and deeper – and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows views into space directly over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is tightened in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its special feature: the high light collecting power.
This is because, despite a comparatively small mirror diameter, it is close to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to the space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which pays tribute to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is said to be 42 meters - and to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new giant telescope is also to be created on the Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here you can see it on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been delivering images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets – mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planetary candidates had been identified since the mission began.
The image documents the latest launch preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched aboard an Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger orbits far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
For decades, radar measurements have suggested that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter every day - and becoming 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus roams over the winding road, past densely forested hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talys, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijani and is very long-lasting.
The final stop is Lerik.
The small town boasts overly steeped architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the journey from Azerbaijan’s capital Baku.
It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometers because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world here," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here, the vita is documented by about eight dozen talics from the area older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, another child was born.
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in the face of the oldest documented person, who turned 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have had a daughter.
So has <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov paid off by a few decades at his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, an old-age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
"Remarkably many high-aged people also live in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to the lack of documents, there was no scientific evidence of the age, especially since registers of the national status were missing.
Every day, melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik remarkably often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the South?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is due to the diet.
But the fact that the calorie-rich diet of the Talys is supposed to be so healthy, that they love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day does not seem plausible from a nutritional perspective.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that rolls her back and forth tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and one daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two young children also jump around.
In the kitchen, guests are served tea, which is served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly in line and limb, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
“I never used shampoo,” says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pensions are enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven’t bought groceries in the supermarket all my life.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst after the Second World War.
But everything got better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old ones.
230 manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local circumstances an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s long-grayed son is also right: “The ancients enjoy respect in our culture.”
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as the basis is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because they all, so far hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile by the graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi said he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers “to save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are aware of, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be exonerated?
In fact, the 234 articles that were whipped through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a 15-hour parforce ride at night are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, it is stated in the draft that the case-law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does “principles” mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
This suggests at least one newly added article: In all matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great radiance in the entire Sunni Islam.
That doesn’t have to, but it can mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto result in the disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
A lot in the draft is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak’s reign to oppress oppositionists.
After the dictator’s fall, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
The state should also, as it says in the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morality and values."
This is legally so blurred that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
No article explicitly states equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Likewise dubious, the wording suggests that the "insulting of people" is forbidden.
Is there enough caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
It is a matter of interpretation, as is so much in the draft that Morsi is present for signature and, according to his words, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for a referendum.
“The revolution has returned.”
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unfamiliar harmony on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo, vowing to bring down the Charter before it can enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed president.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft constitution belongs "on the garbage mountain of history".
Via Twitter, he accused Mursi’s supporters of wanting to lead a “coup against democracy”.
“If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow it,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced they would not want to oversee the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to counter-demonstration, but not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile bank in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists took part and shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Mursi, "Cleanse the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A battle for supremacy over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have conjured up civil war-like conditions.
Mursi’s supporters obviously didn’t want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamist draft is considered safe.
"The word 'human rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, which should have been going until February and involving all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
“And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution,” he complains in a conversation with the “World on Sunday.”
Mursi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state had the lawyer resigned.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto repealed it," Saeda laments.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, who considers the ideological battle of direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns: "You are nurturing a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most nasty fish in the world?
Norway’s five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards – not only in Europe, but around the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have anything to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You have to imagine the nose-deafening smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and that persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-sprayed trout, which is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how stinky you would like your fish to be.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this, now, really very captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then flush it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but also organizes the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk-General".
People around us eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirits can displace the smell.
I'll have a few snacks.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk near the nose, it is not bad - like sushi, which has a pretty long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian epoch when there were no cooling options and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then removed after long fermentation and - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol-damped senses - consumed.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians in search of work were forced to leave their country and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival who was not too long ago far richer than Norway, immigrants flock.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important – as an essential, albeit strictly smelling, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes that you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often make it to the world press, and most people don’t seem to bother.
Here one still hates to call Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we refer only to the “July 22 incident”.
Norwegians struggle to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world has been the main responsibility for Norway’s present-day wealth.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes the round trays with ripe rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and stinging blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Your English is just like most people here.
We're not very polite, we don't like bragging.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry's revenues are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone threw money around them that they didn’t own at all, Norway held its purse tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and get ready for another dish - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat is mouthing me.
But in the evening, the stink fish is on the menu again.
The hotel I’m staying in is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best – or perhaps the most challenging – fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here's our points, Havard".
You are clapping and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
As Mexico’s future president, Enrique Pena Nieto, prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly poor.
Even on better days, this city is always congested, but on Monday a steel ring was erected, blocking several important traffic routes to the capital and causing chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential tie and take over the leadership of the nation.
He is faced with a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to help us achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, people like to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute it to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built, which is a big improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, as far as security and the economy are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway junctions and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a patch of land near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the past two years.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico – a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not adequately addressed the problem of women’s murders during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his government closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the declining neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with the tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the corpse stiff had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana looks down on us. It is attached next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But this, according to the family, has been denied to her so far.
The authorities treated me as if I were a chatterer, a troublemaker, a nerd.
They want you to simply accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
"But that's not possible if there were so many shape errors and failures," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential tie on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his tenure.
"I hope that as president he is the same as he was governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
This is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Prosecutors claim Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
Prosecutors contradict Bradley Manning’s allegations that he was abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the charge due to harsh detention conditions
The U.S. Army Freedman is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor’s office on Friday tried to find that Army-liberated Bradley Manning – accused of revealing the greatest confidential information in U.S. history – missed several occasions to complain about the ill-treatment he allegedly suffered in military detention.
During a cross-examination of Manning's during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month prison term in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints whatsoever about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to reject the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard time in detention - Manning had declared that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meetings with Manning during his detention at the Quantico Military Prison, where he had sat under increased detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, Fein said, did not contain any complaints about abuse, although officials had directly questioned Manning about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they were dealing with them, but that they had not been recorded.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) 'No problems', and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observational status for "prevention of injuries."
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is one stage under the risk of suicide - for his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observational status to prevent injury (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once became unconscious due to the heat.
Not knowing what was going on with him or in the outside world was a burden.
"My world has shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell – at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours – and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving, because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that entered his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards could not see his face anymore, he was awakened to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally appealed Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - for example, he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico for one night and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had stated that he had never had the opportunity to wrap himself with his blanket during this count.
At the interview on Friday, Manning stated that he had concluded on an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket he could have covered himself with, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night, and had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning had told the official that he could have used the waistband of his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take his detention experience into account and drastically reduce his sentence should he be convicted in his trial in the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offenses, while other charges deemed too extreme are to be challenged.
The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend, and the prosecutor's office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions applicable to all inmates held under the highest security measures in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, transmission of national defense information, and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he will face a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants – they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport checkpoint when my senselessness spread inside me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure what to go to.
I grew up in Central California and have been called “Mexican” all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians".
Later, I decided to go for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I don’t get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues that one expects when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans today are equally likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even though he did not mention any details in this regard.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never wasted a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country’s leadership to give them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes even the mildest criticism of Mexico, you hear complaints about how Americans are oppressing the sovereignty of their neighboring country, in the Mexican press and among the country’s elites.
And the children of Montezuma go on the war path.
And yet Mexico’s biggest challenge, in fact, lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at one point in our family tree, a person – perhaps a parent or grandparent – was not offered a chance in Mexico and migrated northward.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may now have lived the American dream, attended good schools, and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the American dream we live—not the Mexican one.
Our identity may be blurred at times, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership don’t like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have left.
And then we wouldn’t see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain—with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are – and Mexican Americans take it ill.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they don’t belong to one country or the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional “ambassadors” for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
Let us tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well, now.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through that alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge over how their family members were treated not so long ago.
- Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual blame, countless buildings have been smashed, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed – and for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem have been smashed.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not – Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these turmoils.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems far from appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the truce agreed on 21 November continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened the hard-fought on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, even though his group itself suffered major losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are trapped in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is winning in the West Bank, controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders may conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to attract powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power once regarded as Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken over for the Hamas party – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Rejoicing Hamas supporters believe that Israel is forming an Islamist crescent – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has the power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist prominence could face the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt – by far the most populous and most important Arab country – on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laizist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is weakened with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot even be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, “Iron Dome”, has proven itself and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
For at least a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States holds its position firmly, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has been doing well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the barriers that run into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal but are constantly being expanded.
Netanyahu’s Likud party has allied with an even more militant group in the run-up to the January 22 election under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these insidious Palestinians also mess around and leave their own state to them?
If they really had control of the West Bank, wouldn’t they, like their fellow Gazars, also fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could make a difference to them.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
That pragmatic President Mursi teamed up with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps towards democratization, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder barrel that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Suppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only exacerbate.
Bloody missions to push back Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand its diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is the one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel resigns for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give more influence to outsiders in order to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms shipments to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchanges and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also push Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the imminent request for UN observer status.
Obama must also play his part in urging Israel to negotiate.
During his first term in office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he is also averse to participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian legislation on unified cigarette packaging comes into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first single cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and infants and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and images once, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, printed in identical, small fonts, is coming Saturday.
Australia is introducing the strictest regulations for tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian government wants to stop young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous picture of tobacco use.
The government assumes that studies have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 years of age are 99% likely to stop smoking afterward.
"You can see from young children that they understand the message of trying to promote the tobacco companies with their brand image," says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The Tobacco Lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Zico Import Pty Ltd’s Sandra Ha, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has risen enormously since British American Tobacco, Britain’s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed to challenge the laws two months ago in the Supreme Australian Court.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the catch is in the popularity of social media with exactly the population group to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, forbidding them to act as sports sponsors, and forcing most retailers to stop investing cigarettes in stores.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Those who market tobacco and have only a small area left to promote their products don’t get around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in experience reports on brands written by “very normal people.”
One has to ask oneself: is this just a private person who finds such a big favor with Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries conduct greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a tip and put the box away," says Victor El Hage, buying a cigarette box that prints a photo with a mouth tumour.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the “King of the Pack” tobacco trade in downtown Sydney, says the unified packaging has made it difficult to replenish its shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have told ourselves okay, that's it, we're closing up," he adds visibly emboldened.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored sometimes.
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane was down due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to get bored with a few thoughts.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying – even when books, magazines, and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are leading boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us — and our children — to get bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thought processes, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are staring almost constantly at one or the other screen these days, we no longer benefit from the benefits of boredom.
Should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah, yeah.
And no.
I'll go back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), doesn't see it that way.
“In fact, boredom has a very long history,” he says.
Pompeii’s house walls adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After long reading of research literature and presenting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of wanting to do a satisfying job, but not being able to do it.
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
With apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time is only passing slowly".
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, even if we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German for example: "The idle mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to a volume in front of which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content, others heard it at low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said they felt more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, couldn't find a reason for this and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
Trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task can lead to the disruption of attention to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you do a monotonous job - "like searching for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that tangles and scribbles, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to roll around are learning more and retaining more information than those who are forced to sit breastfeeding," Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored at some point – my late flight, a roaring loudspeaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored easier than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of boredom susceptibility" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida – particularly in terms of the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teens are a pretty tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored at school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored when they were not in school.
However, only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn’t know if the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have much influence on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it causes people to take on extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to alleviate them – studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity, and this is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you will be happy.
However, while television can provide happiness in the short term, it can escape in the long term.
So if you give your bored child an iPad, it can keep them from being bored, but it has not learned to entertain or control themselves, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, "Self-control transfers from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to entertain, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we consider them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even outside of constant activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but boredom is the agonizing, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth people are only looking for a way to shut down and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with once the noise is silenced."
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is facing a crime in southeastern Colorado that will soon be legal in that state: the possession of a few marijuana chunks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were traveling by car in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drug utensils — cavalry offenses, each with a $100 penalty — and received a court appointment.
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the site.
Hundreds of regulatory offences revolving around marijuana have already been dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer prosecute adults over the age of 21 for possession to a small extent, which is permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have announced continuing to prosecute existing marijuana offenses and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the Denver suburbs to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This situation is evolving so fast that I don’t even know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, head of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013 in mind.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is ahead of most states when it comes to the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is good for orientation,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for the Washington State Spirits Authority.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6th, forming the endpoint of a grey area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified during this time – for example, how to agree the state’s requirement of “appropriate access” to licensed marijuana with the banning of cannabis shops within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his employees in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses among individuals over the age of 21, and that the police would not seek "immediate" criminal charges for these offenses.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban regulations to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people have to face trial for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
“Our agency has the duty to prosecute violations that were criminal offences at the time of the crime,” Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even ambiguous in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, are no longer showing adults for possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending possession procedures.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state have brought to light a deep rift among local officials with regard to the great green experiment.
District prosecutors are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver-based lawyer who represents defendants on trial for marijuana offenses and acts locally as a spokesman for the national marijuana law reform organization.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting people for still not being able to accept legalization," he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national sample cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite several eye-catching arrests of consumers and medical marijuana sellers, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama administration drug policy adviser, believes that while criminal officials will likely not enter doors to confiscate smaller amounts of drugs, they will probably resist tolerating legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal authorities approved moratoriums on new marijuana stores, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided on a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a major problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this change of law.
We focus on what the community has chosen and not on what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only today’s university students are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university, which I once considered to be the world’s greatest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization—free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of moving to Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I had left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A. N. Wilson said that I had left university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I was suffering from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my very unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason - a reason that seemed all the more narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been a major adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right suffers from similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same level of equal rights protection that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Junior Common Room (JCR) state they are "often actively isolated, personally assaulted and declared undesirable" due to their political views.
They demand a place on their college’s equality committee to ensure their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was exacerbated by a recently aired documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, it featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Student Association, who rode in a Rolls-Royce and wore a silver-colored suit and silver-studded walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are regarded as "sincliners for introducing higher tuition fees."
20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Student Association, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing tendency in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is "unpleasant". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, says she has observed a growing rejection of students of the moderate right among JCR members.
"This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and the well-being of members," she says.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I was one of such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university had voted not to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even frightened Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students, but even took part with pleasure.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, the privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorium.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled into it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite hated.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes, tears swelled.
"I suggest they take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt murmured to me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That evening, I was sitting alone in college at dinner, when someone slightly tapped me on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is being harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters claim to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to adjust.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics, and business who ironically attended Eton College, which was considered conservative, told me, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
“How do Tories have sex?” one asked.
They beat each other, right?
I felt the same way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in living a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and have to suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that were before me extended before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of fear and isolation.
The only tutor openly recognizing himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for his Marxist-determinist perspective on history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends always displayed impeccable manners.
His damp eyes were clouding.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had given in to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, where another history tutor had seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly crushed with shame, I admitted that my parents had undergone "brainwashing," calling them "old bastards."
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who slapped the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my hazers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a whiny slut.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragically, it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened in London this week, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 haute couture dresses were put together, created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stuffy and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, ranging from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
"At the very least, they don't kick their toes out on your magnificent carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
“All invited people felt important and loved,” recalls the “top model” that began her career at the 1995 Haute Couture week in Paris.
“He never gets out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessiveness, rather of mutual affections.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long catwalk, proposing a roller swap: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy owns in her wedding with Arist<0xC3><0xB3>teles Onassis, the "Far<0xC3><0xA8>re's Onassis" costume, the "thes, the Onassis,
In this audience of fashion dolls, names such as that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Maker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "gillete" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," Feria's ex-duchess added.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion-leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that honoured his name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Par<0xC3><0xAD>s, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding dress for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a four and a half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society."
For years with the "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre" of the elite, Valentino is now their best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, accumulates Garavani as many honors as each of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his well-kept and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg admits.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; time leaves no trace of him".
This is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health when they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulphur-containing gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders across the sloping paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb at the turtle pace, keeping the balance and carefully taking their steps so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract.
Once at the top, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk three kilometers with the tiresomely heavy baskets to the scale, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been exploiting the volcano’s deposits since 1960 and (no better yet) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
She then sells this for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who normally makes three runs a day.
It takes three hours for each track, after which it is completely done, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhuman effort, however, is three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where the coffee harvest pays 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason as important as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I took her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I’m going to work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carry-on.
It shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o’clock, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders at the crater bottom.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to carriers that work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guardians of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), will demand from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a stubborn 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as possible" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and itches the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners are trapped in the thick columns rising out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious illnesses... of course except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik with his 53 years is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks via a goat’s path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari at 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest with his 30 years also works as a sulphur bearer.
Time passes, but poverty persists generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: that of those who work as human loads on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are blamed for not having children, on the career, stress and cost of real estate and child rearing.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we fulfill our civil duty and we create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint sweets, but nevertheless – or precisely because of that – they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper's song, the local sayings such as "sliding a "bao" (laib) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, maintains the hope that the ad will reach out in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
In breeding, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is a topic we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possibly many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, like composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Anyone who does not take this issue easy is the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that rate exceeded 2—which is also known as replacement rate—was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marital and family policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to “better education” and “greater career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities besides getting married and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of singles and the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract the reduction of population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely concealed xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments will be built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the individual, and that they deter construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give developers clearer orientations that were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, it can be seen from the conversations with Singaporeans working in the financial district that they will not have a big impact.
“People are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many,” says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"For me, it's important to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and cost of ownership and education as reasons for not being able to have children.
That’s why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – there’s so much the government can do.
offline Private offline is online private
Privacy policy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to your everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he puts himself at risk when he introduces situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Peri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequently on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very personal" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
“I wouldn’t reveal my deepest secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge while trying to explain the meaning of “privately” in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that’s not mine, or someone who makes the fool,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of naked people, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I just upload them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
When asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommended him to a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teen has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, and in Ask admits to not knowing 20 of the people he has added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, for example, music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him clues or asked him for his address or telephone number.
“If someone is pushing me or asking for it from me, I’ll just remove it from my user account,” he admits.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with experiences known today as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just did it privately.”
After that, he explains a series of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I want to wipe him out one.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information, but with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" shaped these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are they, the children and adolescents who grew up with this technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants they’re supposed to teach, while we’re still learning,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we require them to have a defined criterion about what may be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient."
“They should also be picky when it’s most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
“To tell them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to post a photo of you, like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before when labeling photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Does everyone need to know what you’re doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them an understanding that they need to act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is indispensable for parents to carefully read through the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You shall not speak to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was theoretically to be signed by the seven present governors.
Efe tried repeatedly to gain access to the signed document at the Sixth Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the exam, but then stated that it would be published at some point on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, to the press with brief explanations.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulating among the journalists was received by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document disseminated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
The Peruvian presidential office then sent the media an e-mail with the "declaration" of the summit, but it was the declaration of Humala and not the official document at the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite the press’ insistence, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been previously announced, was not published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems would be available for the journalists, but they greatly restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Hague Court of Justice that resolves a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICC, which begins in The Hague on Monday, in the process that Lima initiated against Santiago, to hear the pleas of both sides.
“We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are presently bringing to this International Court of Justice,” Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile was, is and will continue to be a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
Both presidents confirmed that they would submit to the ICC after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, considered it a serious mistake to have brought an action against the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunchtime in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, in which it announced that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for a total investment of $17 billion.
Regarding the decisions made, he said that the countries of the Unasur will take "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residency rights."
He said that measures would be promoted to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America, and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant steps, but should serve to expand our production output and show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
“We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects designed to improve spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms,” the Peruvian president said in a read-only statement.
Among these projects were five Peruvians lying on the transverse axes of his territory from the coast to Brazil, two of whom are intended to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption into the Union of South American Nations," it said.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
With this in mind, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he was expecting a meeting with his Nicaragua counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, to treat the maritime conflict with respect following a judgment of the ICC questioned by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
“Maybe I’ll meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday),” Santos said.
"We will review all these paths - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also necessitates talks with Nicaragua," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the takeover of the new president of this country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defense Ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru presides over the regional bloc.
“South America must learn to integrate its citizens,” says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador’s President, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that creating a common citizenship is a goal, with “South America actually being able to learn something from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told state television in Peru that Europeans "killed each other in World War II and other conflicts" and "are practically a homeland today."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that drives the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said in a statement, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa reassured that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but rather adhered to his “deep democratic values and views on human rights.”
He added that “there were justified assumptions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and would not comply with his procedure.”
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which demanded that he be interrogated on his territory for alleged sexual offences, while "swedish jurisprudence allows this through a video conference that could have been carried out via Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental health would be compromised.
“Since he’s been in our embassy, I haven’t spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one,” Ecuador’s head of state said.
However, there is a risk that he will suffer physical and psychological damage because he is trapped in a tight space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
“This would affect everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since June was the granting of a free letter to allow him to travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of the UK, Sweden and Europe's legal authorities, underlining that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word for this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, is conducting a series of proceedings at various European instances," he said.
And "if Britain grants this letter tomorrow, in my opinion, this is done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, how Swedish case law allowed it and was done in other cases, the problem would be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate is “mediocrity, evil intent, and the lie that undermines freedom of expression.”
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail,” he said.
With this in mind, he congratulated himself that Ecuador will no longer be dominated by such journalists "and neither by the bankers nor by the hegemonic and spies-bourgeois countries," and anticipated that in a re-election, he "will deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in that right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and not allow an opportunism and no coup d'état to be legally disguised" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the verdict of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated extensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
Similarly, he relied on a good conclusion of the maritime border disputes between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if both countries commit to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh."
Regarding the possibility of him standing as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to meet that responsibility,” he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to Vice-President of Venezuela Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned, routine treatment, and that he was expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean a relapse in President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State attended the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima today, which ended with a call for higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death from AIDS is now too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to be HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor "attempted to mitigate" without any apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to inform himself about it; and this with such dedication that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who do not know about their disease and for whom the virus has already caused damage and their immune system has exhausted, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes the treatment on time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," explained the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
Andrade Villanueva, a specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at the start of treatment, and that those who had greater chances of counting a CD of 200 and of not counting a CD of 50 years: up to 30 years.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who are diagnosed HIV-positive at the age of 25 can, in this sense, "get 75 years of age without problems as long as they are under control," he explained.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA’s annual report), it is still true that 60 percent of patients recorded in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by the month of May of this year, there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- So why do people still die from it?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no supply problems with the medications. The problem is that the people come in far advanced condition because they do not know their infectious state, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. To be able to influence global mortality, more early diagnoses are needed, which is why massive detection tests must be offered to all people who need to do so."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevenci<0xC3><0xB3>n del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients like Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, and this for the only reason that it had even been a friend of him who was already a tumour in the AIDS-Pha.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die already, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was for improvement, I'm eating well, exercising and taking the medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, I do a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio recounts, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, with his testimony to animate those who are afraid today as part of the worldwide AIDS Day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the people at risk for new infections are the adolescents.
"Why do you need them?" is a common ridicule question from social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system, who do not want to expose themselves to young people, the correspondent insured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be located behind the counter, but in dispensing devices in public toilets of facilities frequented by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez responded to the question of whether conservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
Nationally, the state ranks 4th in new and accumulated cases of AIDS, and 13th in terms of HIV.
92% of cases of infection occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
After the United States Court of Appeals has confirmed a judgment that does not recognize the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s liabilities achieved through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent is set for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
So it could be said that the procedures for surviving the companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the Stars and Stripes in conflict with international agreements.
In practice, the June 15 recognition of the verdict by Judge Harlin Hale at Bancarrotas Court for the Northern District of Texas causes Mexican companies to be helplessly exposed to confiscation of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, initially states that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy dealt in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created, using the American Law Institute as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies following recognition of the liabilities in the bankrupt mass that Vitro’s branches had with their parent company, the majority required for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been reached.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among group companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also correct that, after subtracting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is blamed for its difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country blows.
For this reason, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family appeals to the same appeals court in order to vote in plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare objection is filed, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the court set aside a document sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) describing the proceedings conducted by Vitro under the Trade Bankruptcy Act, and pointing out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-banded caramboles: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican aviation unions against the former owner Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, failed for several months, the Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (the pilots’ union) has finally made progress.
The application cited by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Thereafter, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE under the name Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares in the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of bourgeois society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the run-up, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has managed to unite the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental institution, which partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government failed to comply with a Senate request to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place even though the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long-term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without compromising short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is launching over 500 million pesos of stock market certificates.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competitive
Formed from the companies NYCE, e-Qu<0xC3><0xA1>lity and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose goal is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball globetrotter, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been associated with basket sports for more than 60 years and has travelled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a lower-class player, player of the first national league, proxy and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n or president of the Basketball Association.
"For my entire life, I have put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled on a visit from Primera Hora to his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
The most emotional memories are those reminiscent of his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-director or managing director of the club.
“These were my best years I have enjoyed the most because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, be it as managing director, co-manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships successively from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," Reyes says.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, “I have a very strong and 2m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a native and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The Vaqueros Championship with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and Mincy's in the national team.
I remember when we won the US for the first time at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we took fourth place, which should have been bronze if it had not been that Canadian referee who let us repeat the last turn for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this 1990 World Cup group the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, as was the one who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
My favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the USA a fight, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blocked players because of the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any prediction.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
And this without considering his career in the different leagues he played in.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 90s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, the children make unnecessarily many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked the most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died at the Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted to drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Bezaubernde Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "Jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He has also starred in two short-lived comedies, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His cinematic work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly detestable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain about the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", which was supposed to create the expectation for an episode full of emotions where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series reached a record for spectators at that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had impregnated her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons for wanting to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to enlist his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he hasn’t won.
Victoria Principal, co-actress of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as an "enormous personality on and off the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of worshippers in the world and remains in our hearts for those of us who have had the good fortune to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just shot, the station informed.
Warner or TNT did not immediately explain how Hagmann’s loss would be handled in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the Air Forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I believed could harm someone or harm them in any way," the Associated Press said at the time.
After the liver transplant, he campaigned for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I'll meet with them when their operations are imminent and after that," he said in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also campaigned against smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course that studies the "end of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long back count” on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have referred to as “Dedarmaggedon,” as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place Christian theorists believe the apocalypse is beginning.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only professor to offer courses on the “end of the world” this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they compare to real life.
“I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course called "The End of the World."
“We’re not taking 2012 so we always have the option to hold the course again in case the world doesn’t go down,” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent downfall", students must study, create projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the apocalypse, so students have no other chance than "to continue working until night, where the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more seats," Restall said of his course for high-average students, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there were still seats available.
The students themselves assure that the course is among the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers's Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a matter of consolation or its absence.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed—and less so a professor—explained to believe in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayans, and in certain ways we discredit them,” said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that goes back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
“People don’t think that way elsewhere,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know there a course about the "end of the world".
“The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world,” he wrote in an injunction to an exception to a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been spoken by the last court, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world will come.
Students and professors take this date easy.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about “the end of the world.”
“Maybe I’ll call a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
