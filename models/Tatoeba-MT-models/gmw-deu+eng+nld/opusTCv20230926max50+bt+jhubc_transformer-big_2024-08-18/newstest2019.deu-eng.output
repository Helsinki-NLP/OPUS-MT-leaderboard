In the afternoon another surprise awaits our candidates: they will not contest the romantic candlelight shoot in front of MY SOLARIS alone, but at the side of Male-model Fabian!
Hvar - flirting, flirting, seducing - not easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Munich" candidates deliver on the shoot with people photographer Tuan and defy wind, water and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shoot is in the video:
DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that once you get into a conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as it is written in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung".
Despite the months-long debate over the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time international player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed until a certain point that this would be the case," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it by the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not come about so far.
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2.13 p.m., the Linz professional fire brigade was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly across the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in default.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire upon arrival.
The roof had to be virtually completely removed and fire debris had to be cleared to the absolute necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery for charging at lunch.
This could possibly be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined – just like the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Lindsay Lohan Attacks Refugee Family on Open Street
What did Lindsay Lohan do to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to kidnap the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live, as she apparently wants to take the children away from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Fortunately Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family, which she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses adults of child trafficking.
There is no evidence for all of this in the clip.
"The whole world is watching this right now," Lohan said in the video as she continued to pursue the family along the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses a slap.
Under tears, the actress then asserts how shocked she is – and she holds her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It is said to be so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Sulawesi’s death toll rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Chief of Supervisors
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused stock market unrest at the beginning of August, when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The U.S. stock market regulator sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain Chairman of the Board.
Conservative Party of the United Kingdom
Sharply guarded - the Tories' Party Congress
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former foreign minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name duplications for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and this Sunday the population will vote on it - whether it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" emerges as an anti-system candidate and is thus at the forefront of the polls.
His fiercest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers’ Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" rework takes longer than planned
“The diesel task force still exists,” said Peter Mertens, CEO of the development team, in the automotive week magazine.
In December 2017, Audi chief Rupert Stadler, detained and on leave, announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations are expected to be tested," he said.
Mertens said: “At the beginning of July, we have reached an important stage goal in working up the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "grave organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board postponed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and wants to continue to discuss it on Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi chief of having approved the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the exhaust gas frauds became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot, the head of sales, leads the company as the chief executive officer.
Due to the transition to the new exhaust gas and consumption testing standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Schot told the "Heilbronner Stimme".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join DFB-Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup off and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to run for office as DFB president again next year.
“I’m doing my job and trying to make it as good as I can,” Grindel said as a guest at ZDF’s “Current Sports Studio” early Sunday morning.
You have to keep trying to get re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not have "a desire to work on the future project" after the award for the 2024 European Football Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to cooperate in the DFB-Presidium.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he will continue to advise in this role in the Bureau in the future and then of course be cordially invited to provide his experience with sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculations about whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador for the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background clearly works into society and football and says, 'The issue is important, we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Correctly lose weight with half-smart scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the sausage.
Doesn't he tell me if I've replaced fat with muscle?
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear start success for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the basketball Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice champion easily won 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
New addition Rokas Giedraitis was top scorer of the dominating Berliner with 20 points.
The international player Johannes Thiemann (18 points), committed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators in his compulsory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg in the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the most reliable shooter in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
With the basketball Lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings outperformed the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweiger, with NBA star Dennis Schröder being majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the German government to hand over supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were on duty, including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is criticized for being considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Terrible Second
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted greater engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in New York’s Central Park.
"Become involved wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival in the night to Sunday in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also showed themselves on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In between, however, there was a second of terror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shot, got scared and tried to escape.
Shortly there was panic, people were running in confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organizer Hugh Evans said.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people from the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
If you wanted to catch one, you had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was cheer and applause from the audience - Buhrufe on the other hand for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, he spoke out on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, in the Justice Committee of the U.S. Senate for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, Flake had pronounced himself as a judge in the Supreme Court and thus knocked many women to the head.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who reportedly experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him in an elevator on his way to the committee meeting.
"You can also come together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake told the audience at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends journalist's dismissal
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the eviction of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, Seibert told the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disruption of the course of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has created a strong unrest, which is unacceptable.
He said he wanted to get the man out of the car.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Even foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for moist-frightening conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbour pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller and her guests encounter a lot of beer, some wine or even more high-percent drinks to loosen up the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the compulsory singing deposits.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Hottest Day".
The Municher did not get the trip to the high north at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled on it, the eyes only two small slits.
The bed-selfie shows a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's just got a powerful hangover.
To his fans he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also let go.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips on how to fight the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably the most effective - headache pills.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the usually attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller survived the nocturnal sacrificial sacrificial sacrificial sacrificial sacrificial sacrificial sacrificial sacrificial sacrificial sacrificial sacrificial sacrificial sacrific
However, since she has been moderating the TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly proven...

Treysa struggles with vandalism and rubbish
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood Country in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and wasted.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished bins and now dismantled signposts - this is how the entry with a group of people to the cycle path on the Haaasse hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the showpiece Railway Cycle Path in the Red Riding Hood Land a more than unfamiliar sight.
Members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt have been involved in the topic for a long time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the cycling advisory board.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals ranged from the installation of the seating area to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic was also included in the local advisory board.
Not only the rubbish drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebration on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, in the battles is also destroyed: posts from the earth ripped, bins demolished, signs folded over, seating furniture lubricated.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the resting place at the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for sip.
"The focus is clearly on the Haaße hill along the entire cycle path," confirms the cycling commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive".
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe this raises the threshold of infringing on common property significantly.
However, this would require a police raid to be over soon.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haaasse hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path so far can be very satisfied.
The tourism marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical hazard, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no turning track on the Haaße hill.
In the event of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides,” she explains.
This is not a problem for athletic drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and together.
To present "D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with winks in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it soon became a family affair with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albathene in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and the Weßling family.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not seen this in other districts.
What did the writers relate to?
The Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the towns.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his beat-like song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
The sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann knew Franke to report that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
Meanwhile, Alvin Jasic has posted everything on YouTube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record a whole CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, which impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children also appeared again for the final – and sounded “right good” even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, accessibility of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG High School and Oliver Ahlers of the Business Association, as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the District Offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She considered the event to be a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
Players form two teams facing each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red foil - only after you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything by mistake.
On the maps, for example, it reads from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd cube.
4th Feast".
These are the terms that need to be encoded from now on.
Because here we are supposed to guess not the terms, but codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might say "3.4.2".
"Decrypto" is not intended to guess the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible does not; because this wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads out loud: "throws" for the dice, "lose" as opposed to festive; here of course something like "party" and "Prague" would be possible because he has taken care of in school and knows the window collapse there.
This is how it goes round by round, team by team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposite side - but this can be better combined with every hint given by the encryptor there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, the descriptions should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rulebook.
The players probably have to study it quite long and extensively until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also adds an agent theme to a game of few words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever is just about guessing and not about victory points, he can also easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harasses guests at the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspection twice on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed Hitler’s greeting in the Upper City of a passing police strip, then later he also noticed himself in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After not complying with the given place reference by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspectorate in the detention cell.
In the sober state, he must then also be liable for the use of license plates of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was the home of the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers popped at buffers, it was heard in a very pressy way," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
The brakes squeezed and the wagons squeezed.
It was pure railroad.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp-mountain route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 metres of altitude has its vertex in Steinbach am Wald.
To cope with this, train and drawers were needed in the past, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Parliament approved the construction of a railway operating workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshop, driving management and railway mastery.
"Heartpiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and 47-year-old professional railroader.
The railway plant (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the sub-routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and drawbars.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 weighings were still ranked per month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were demolished and in 1991 the rest were demolished.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not considered a better use of the site, also in terms of freight traffic."
At Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later, it's gone.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the shunting station Pressig was history.
"The rangers and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mishandling would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before already Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the World Ranking Thirds is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakh or the Spaniard Carla Su<0xC3><0xA1>rez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina, when the Russian placed at number 13 gave up.
The Swabian now gets to deal with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach this weekend.
With great relief, the organizers and visitors who were registered looked at the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the property Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large audience showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
A bit surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in tried-and-tested, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have helped shape flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is again a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high approval of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical frame.
As the visitor walks through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colour accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" awaits the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a stump, brightened in color, playfully equipped with 20 windshields, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminium tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object looks fairytale-like and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to dedicate herself to the event in three-dimensional letters for 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colourful imagination of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: singer celebrates 50th birthday
1968 - this was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians at that time also breathed their displeasure.
At least five of them.
They did not want to agree partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 algots from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," suspected Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep it right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
For the anniversary they had revived the Foundation Festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it was to have festive clothing had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats in the "House of Meeting" as usual, but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, there was movement: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled the controls and asked for the dance floor.
Honorable thing that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten let the voice sound themselves.
For the occasion, happy songs were announced.
He said, “A day like this, as beautiful as it is today.”
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" was heard, which is the Latin term for "hops".
Once again, the choral direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the tinnenbusch at the time, was sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said: "He has such a light way, it's a masterpiece he performs." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves singingly.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
After all, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented sounding poetry.
There was also a big tombola.
The proceeds are to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins top-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber is marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring is quite right in league three.
No trace of shyness or fracking, the independents are doing their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer the mood was good, the game ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get it to the finish line, such a game can turn up," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to the goal.
“We all know who’s on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break our necks.
I've seen really good volleyball in phases," Annacker did not quarrel with the 0-3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the trip goes for the independents, after just three days of play seems unforeseeable.
“It’s just too early for that,” says Axel Büring.
Only in one, he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball." In the fourth league they do not want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they must look upwards.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take place in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Dream Ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series may have had a complicity in her marriage out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as the chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left for good.
The series that made her a star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could have been a reason, too.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled around the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues perceived me at eye level," Keller told the "Bild am Sonntag".
At first she had always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dream ship".
For now, the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so much, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her husband at the time might have been quite jealous, but “like many men, Hans also shunned conversations about problems and feelings.”
Keller had always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody "and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have distorted myself," she further explains.
She always felt like she wasn’t good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I was in fact never, even though I sometimes seemed cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härter, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time".
The day before the civil wedding, I sat in the cloakroom crying and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time “as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have approached love far too naively.”
The night butterfly, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city at the NZZ resort in Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the glare in which a green carpet is dipped in the six-lane square blinds it beyond measure.
But it is still a film festival, because more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening he torches over the place to make himself short in the "Aquaclean WC Oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet system, sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The need facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion is making a lot of effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, it stinks in the man's oasis for some reason.
So out here, across to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store, as every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: the works shown are known to originate from all over the world.
What you don’t have to think about in an article about this festival in order not to fall into sneak advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly ties a band around the probes, which has a good fairy to it, and two bully doorkeepers actually wink him in generously.
Inside, the guests rush, they dance to live music far after midnight or let DJ rhythms pretend to shout at each other, and flush down with Cüpli exquisite bites.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters wait for slurping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is bubbling.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If that were two separate instructions, he missed the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry will tip a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink does not necessarily get this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting that brand for years, isn't here that evening either.
But then, between local prominence, cash desk and kitchen items, a face passes that seems familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His protagonist should not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost acting like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He's not being touched, not bewildered, at most he's stealing.
Especially for this reluctance, often misunderstood as a jam, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dance
Coach and ex-football star Diego Maradona is looking forward to the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well into his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rythms, as can be seen in a video already released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fueled by the players.
The Mexican second-team team defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my guys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send after last-minute plea "destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the Handball-Verbandsligist ASV Send, could hardly believe it: "So a bitter defeat". His protégés were "destroyed" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly for long periods, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we have completely slept", the ASV coach was annoyed.
At 8:1, the housekeepers were quick to lead, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken, did not at first bear fruit.
"But then suddenly a rush has gone through the team," Bieletzki summarized the second quarter hour.
At the break, the gap was only two more goals.
Especially Sendens Bester, Marius Hintze, met in the phase one by one.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor’s point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalised to 15:15, then the staff changer performed almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then what?
The impartials intervene in the action.
Bieletzki usually avoids finding fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff paid was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, also stood well against seven men in the back and repeatedly thrown on the empty goal.
Only you can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Huging (1).
Bavaria: Woman has been missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), police are searching for the woman’s remains.
Emergency personnel dug up a street near Marxgrün on Saturday.
To this end, the road surface and several layers below were removed, as police and prosecutors jointly reported.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far from their place of residence at the time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the prosecutor’s office, has been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Heritage Protection Authority, the investigators encountered an abnormality under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the site to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lurk on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it hurt to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an out-of-court dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla are paying $20 million each, and Musk is resigning as Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He is allowed to stay against it.
In the settlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager for fraud in the US federal court of Manhattan.
Musk, who also heads space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, who is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not aware of any guilt.
Musk said he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share, the funding being secured.
Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion in total.
Musk later pushed back: Tesla stays on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.

The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United earns with 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven days of playing only in the midfield.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League match on Tuesday against FC Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.

Joachim Llambi may have separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become famous through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.

Polls: 46% don't want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the rallies of the past few weeks, the GroKo collects several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in an interview - Angela Merkel is critically viewed.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for Bild am Sonntag.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose one counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value so far for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If parliamentary elections were held on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
As a result, the large coalition has lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes – with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently received 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4%.
The bandwidth among the other parties is also large: the AfD, in several polls the second largest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach a vote share of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, while the FDP is at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the percentage of votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also decreased significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wishes that the big coalition will hold until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent are for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there were also significant decreases in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also judge dividedly whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are against it, 44 percent are against it.
For the Union supporters, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Outing at Aldi: Reduced price to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says there are no romantic acquaintance stories in times of Tinder - he should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romance as an acquaintance place for the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts at the root table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder has a reputation for being less a contact, but rather a slippery exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react if you don’t talk around the hot porridge for long in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood love story potential has it when love happiness precedes an out-of-the-eye lost-and-recovered plot.
If the guy also reports to his worshippers under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch<0x40>gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in an Aldi branch unknown to us to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she spoke briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic putten meat".
For her belief in the magic of getting to know each other, she definitely deserved her happy end <0xC3><0xA0> la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been participating in the action "Cover against polio - 500 covers for a life without polio".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease known in German as paralysis leads from paralysis symptoms to death.
In Germany, polio is considered extinct, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be curbed by vaccinations, according to a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for peace for idol
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us any good," said the idol-friend Reus after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen on the TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the football league Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a contract yet.
There is no fixed date when we do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl said on the TV channel Sky on Sunday night.
Football: Bezirksliga: Researchers VfL Wolbeck's appearance against SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his own hard.
He gave himself word, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (internally) to think about the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is running around the Brandhoveweg again.
The 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine is a fresh record, in the past season only very thinly scrapped past the ascent.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked up for each individual to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more play shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), the replaced Luca Rehberg (26) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have avenged itself when the SCA struck dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box in minute 41 twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes intake.
With the replacement of Miles Geske, Fetsch again missed a fresh cell cure from the left side.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbaumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the pitchers 18 meters in front of the guest enclosure.
The fouled man himself stood up and demonstrated his dangerousness to standards.
Westhues" thing with the right flip hit bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the 80th minute unfortunately at the hand in the penalty area.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Wolbeck had to survive bad minutes in the final phase before Geske had the victory goal in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that couldn't be enough for coach Adi Hütter.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, there was an accident on the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m., a drama happened at the airport in Kottingbrunn on Sunday.
When a helicopter landed, there were turbulence, the police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was caught by a gust of wind, hit the ground and came to rest on the side.
Police, rescue and fire departments were immediately notified.
With a large order, the emergency forces came to the site of the accident.
As a precaution, the ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigation.
According to firefighter Franz Resperger, there was a small fire that could be extinguished quickly.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As a result, only 8% of the board members were female as of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
“The companies will have to be different, otherwise the international competitors will pass by them,” said Wiebke Ankersen, managing director of the foundation.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams – with few exceptions – are far from conceivable.
The gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses among the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Lastly, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I'm sure that the Dax companies will be recruiting more consistent women again next year - in their own interests," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signalled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of “zero percent” so far.
A different picture emerges among the supervisory boards: as of 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
“If you recruited as many women for the board of directors every year, a proportion of 40 percent would be reached by 2023,” the report said.
Some even make meise: luxury carrots: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves better.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This question has been dealt with by "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros operating profit in the first half of the year with every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well ahead of EBIT with prices of on average 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes.

Torch train for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
With a torch train, the tourism association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which go up every Saturday in October in the big festival tent on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the jubilee, the responsible people, under the sounds of the Spielmannszug from Wiesenbronn, moved through the place to the festival square.
In the already crowded festival tent, the chairman of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests.
You can be proud of that,” Starz thanked all the helpers.
Later, wine princess Lisa II symbolically kicked off the stage with the guests.
"It's great that so many have found their way to Abtswind again". Later, "Die Troglauer" provided mood.
On Sunday, when Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had set the prices for drinks as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest’s house, before it goes into the second round a day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: Emergency car power in taxi
An emergency car is severely damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn came to a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in the collision of an emergency medical car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, the police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had passed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then bumped into a crossroads with the taxi that was driving at green.
The doctor's car hurled after the collision against a traffic light pole and a tree.
He captured the passer-by who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency medical car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be rescued by emergency personnel.
The 29-year-old, also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency doctor tried to do this – but without success.
The three injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn Public Prosecutor’s Office, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the blamable out in the league cup, Manchester United now also loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
ManU is subject to 1:3 against West Ham United. The way of defeat should still be to speak.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot the 3-1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside on Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defenders stopped, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative highlight of a previously insufficient performance over long distances.
At the moment, the mood at United’s city rival Manchester City is quite different.
The citizens trained by Mourinho’s great competitor Pep Guardiola came to an approximate 2–0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the outsider's defense bar for the first time for the home team.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goal scorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after losing 1–2 in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought Liverpool in the Premier League 1–1 against Chelsea.
As with the Cup-off, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The goal of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, narrowly missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea could not beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the draw in the league, the blues Liverpool now also crashed from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2–0 wins.
However, the Gunners’ fans, in which Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unfortunately pitched Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to the fifth consecutive win and is now immediately behind the great rival Tottenham in 5th place. A strong impression continues to leave ascent Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained undefeated for the fifth time in a row in the league with 2–0 against Southampton and finished 8th.
VW Core Brand Missing: Paris Motor Show in the Sign of Diesel Debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not a topic and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies go at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showcasing their new products in the French capital from next week, together with competitors from all over the world.
Diesel no longer plays a big role.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the shiny backdrops of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the Ingolstädter is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have already been officially presented.
BMW’s iNext is due to start in 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
More than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in alternation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were more than a million visitors.
At least 380 people were killed in the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was hit by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a strength of 5.9, the second a strength of 7.4.
Communication and traffic connections are damaged, there has been enormous damage to property.
After the quake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims is still going up significantly.
So far, the figures are only from Palu.
However, many other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
Approximately 150 Bikers Celebrate Worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorbike service (MoGo) always takes place on the last Sunday of a month at Haus Nordhelle.
Bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to attend a far from ordinary worship service.
Already from 10 a.m. the Bolids were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker's breakfasts were on the agenda and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was held during the Biker service by parish priest Dirk Grzegorek.
For the musical background, the singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests rather poetic-quiet tones," said parish priest Frank Schröder.
Yesterday, too, this was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle worship.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big celebration: After the apple comes the milk
And also at the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also very interested.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated step by step to his astonishing spectators the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and had them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in molds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little apple pieces, which look a little like chopping goods, layer by layer on top of each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorfer farmer also had ready-filled specialties with him.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the older visitors to the newest feather white.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly large.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents got into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of pressing apples, but also discovered the built-up bouncy castle for themselves.
Also active members of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged during the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
In the coming year, the home association will also offer a day of action.
Then, however, according to Gregor Krützkamp, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the theme: after all, it will then go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth-season plea: "Shit situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 professionals around him and gave them courage.
A lot of positives were not seen in the 1:4 (0:2) of the table last at Eintracht Frankfurt, however.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "Of course, this is disappointing, because you always do a lot of things."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met for the follow-up, are with two meters at the bottom and are in their current constitution a candidate for descent.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored in front of 46,300 spectators the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who after the successful general rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome advanced with seven points into the midfield of the table.
Croatia’s vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hesse during his starting eleventh debut and never got to grips with Hannover’s defence.
The striker, who had been battling for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan loaned by Liverpool FC also stood for the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who started swinging.
Lucas Torr<0xC3><0xB3>’s (17th) header, which has been falsified to the goal net, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense around Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords almost inevitably fell and totally deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defensive corner, Haller extended per head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defensive player who came in the summer from the French second division AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt continued before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully refueled himself and left 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
In the halftime, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak notion of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony played a bit more courageously forward, but igniting ideas remained out until shortly before the end, when the follow-up hit was still successful.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After just under an hour, Rebic started a solo and then set straight on De Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only show running for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests, Jovic also hit one minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
Munich mayor Dieter Reiter made it to the opening of the 185 in front of millions of people.
Municher Wies'n last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christen celebrates Holy Cross Festival
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on 14 September or on Sunday after that.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shot Christ, who dates from the 30-year-old war and on which a Swedish soldier is said to have shot.
Blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From this a large pilgrimage developed to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
This is not finished until today, only the altar room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, priest Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance for the parish of Geising, the service was poorly attended.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the Feast of the Cross ended.
For many years now, the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting the worldly part of the festival to the Catholic parish hall.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon the parish offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, roof, the sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been standing for some time, the damages could be more accurately identified and the individual tenders were prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been determined, which only became possible through the inspection by means of a scaffold.
The pedestal plastering work has been completed, the natural stone work is still to be started before the winter and it is hoped that more than half of these work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" is now handed over to its destination - all the attendees agreed at the inauguration date.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the Wohnheim of Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
In his concept, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free accesses for all areas.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer's building was put to the test for residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer contemporary in the equipment," Bader explained retrospectively.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Life support invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State taxed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balance between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the residents to experience the freedom to move without any help from others.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile".
The homeliness and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this location is a real case of luck, because it can no longer be purchased in the current situation".
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1,500 square meters, which are divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by tariff.
Germany: Schwesig complains of differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, SPD deputy chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to settle for the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone nearly 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old pungsan hunting dog is said to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given two North Korean pungsan hunting dogs to South Korean President Moon Jae In as a gift.
As Moon’s office said on Sunday, the two approximately one-year-old dogs reached their recipient on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to "facilitate the acclimatization" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the friendship gift at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
As part of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
This is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition’s working week beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not mantra-likely invoked the "return to tangible work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the justified question of what is the difference between work and tangible work, but be it.
If the federal government is now ready to re-dedicate itself to its mission - to governing - then it should not be prevented from being debated by terms.
Whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blasphemies of the last weeks, will probably already show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet on the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to regularly convene this round to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First, however, with the diesel retrofits and the skilled workers’ immigration law, conflicting issues are once again on the agenda.
CSU transport minister Scheuer wants to make the car companies get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technical retrofit older diesels.
While the diesel crisis has seen a rapprochement over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from each other in the planned Immigration Act.
The SPD calls for a stay prospect for rejected asylum seekers who work or do an education.
The Union is strongly opposed to the "track change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute between the coalition partners – and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal has joined the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society of such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not advance.
But in order to be constructive, disputes must not again be built up on the question of being or not being for partisan reasons.
It’s still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should argue - but always keep an eye on people's reality of life.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, it is pragmatically possible to clarify both the diesel and the lane change question - and thus regain confidence.
This is why the People’s Party has to fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in sight
Does the Minister of Labour infringe the applicable civil service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" her legists had worked on the social security reform, an exuberant social minister reported at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) comes astonishing - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via inquiry.
"The Minister only expressed her enthusiasm for the use of her team and did not want to announce any violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras," she said.
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to be able to acquit Hartinger "of any suspicion".
Police break a street in search of women's body
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is still closed until Monday in the Marxgrün area.
The investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters together with his guide in multiple use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said piece of road together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bavarian Heritage Protection Authority.
For more than a year now, the public prosecutor’s office and the criminal police have been handling the missing case.
Again and again, a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike’s body might have been shattered here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colored powders and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia’s anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is celebrated for the first time.
But before that, there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police have occurred in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence advocates, among other things, with color powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 police officers from Polic<0xC3><0xAD>a Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who were in the polls last year during the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
At the time, when attempting to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists then tried to break the police chain by force, throwing the officers with color bags and eggs, among other things.
Six people were arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, according to the authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum was held for the first time.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split off the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to Belgium in exile.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in U-detention.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the inauguration of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westphalia: Gathering inconvenience: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split goallessly
Red and white Ahlen continues to appear on the spot.
At FC Gütersloh, too, it was only a 0-0 draw.
The final light and the third last, they revealed in front of 438 spectators at Heidewaldstadion as a gathering of reluctance.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Anyone who wanted to get a beer or a sausage could do so without worrying.
There was no danger of missing a torch, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire match in the 28th minute.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle the only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area border.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel was aiming just above the housing from 18 meters and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz it went fixed.
The swiftly presented counter over Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a flawed shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they retaliated with a header by Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball by former Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, initially bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners did not achieve it.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did it bring in anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played at zero". But unfortunately the zero also stood at the front.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent had no desire to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively “splittered everything a bit” against a team “that just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel like we could get a counter goal," Daut said.
To his sorrow, however, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for whom these donations are intended, are pleased.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the space was still a bit empty, but that was to change over the course of the day.
"It's so nice here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Franz Josef Holthaus, the organizer of the festival, welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a decent touch of humor as always.
For the couple Brockmann, who was supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in at short notice.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are plenty of cremators.
And the "replacement" could not be taken away, in between musically entertaining the ever-increasing visitors.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung along at a later hour.
"Just great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many active people with their stands, including mainly clubs.
"Actually, there shouldn't be such a thing as a table," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colourful painting - here's what's going on.
Then the Maikranz was taken off by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken to the winter quarters.
Many stalls were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his paper saw.
He had veneer works, beer lids with reckenfeld motifs and much more on offer.
One specialty was offered by three beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, tasted so good the cake.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with local political message: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknowns have advertised in a hardly conducive way for the construction of a skateboard.
In several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for material damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" were displayed on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro had already been discovered after the professional election fair on September 19.
Since the short message at the time was apparently left "only" with an Edding, it could have been removed without any problems.
"A few days later, however, it was back there, this time sprayed on," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
Especially this case gets a special touch by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate facility is built, its implementation will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of school, sport and culture, without naming a name.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the lubricated board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the subject of skateboarding.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL-Klinik, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
The Council finally voted for the majority in favour of the firefighter’s parking lot.
However, this notion was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June there was a turnaround.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says on the state of the art that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The city council has the last word.
He expects a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Air traffic control shortages are getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said Matthias Maas, the head of the aviation safety union, to the German press agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known staff shortage in European air traffic controllers, for which there is no quick solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," he said.
Europe-wide, the market for ready-trained solders is empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticized the fact that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city on Friday, representatives of the federal, state, air traffic control, airlines and airports come together to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, this will not be possible without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air traffic control company.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for the lottery misers.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at national air traffic controllers are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to advocate in Brussels for regulations that "do not tighten the air further" for air traffic controllers.
At present, EU targets will be agreed by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobbying pressure from airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs of the airlines would initiate a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", Maas said.
The so far announced admission of 120 pilot students annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary personnel build-up is not yet associated with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans for the restructuring of the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board of Management at the meeting on Sunday, the crippling group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in personnel beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side has only eight heads.
This is opposed to ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be made by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include, among other things, the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, is to bundle the business with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demonstrations of police officers and Catalan independence advocates.
At two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police officers and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 independence advocates demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a large order to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
However, according to the armed forces, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and throwing shots.
According to the data, there were also ranges between the participants of the various protest trains.
Rescue workers said 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had acted against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government, almost exactly one year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez to the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, dismissed the accusation.
“Of course, we want to support our comrades, who last year did only their duty: to defend the law,” he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because that is a great European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, “did not come to provoke,” the policeman assured.
Failure allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security vulnerability in a mobile app has caused the personal data of ministers and deputies of the conservative British Tory party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
The police in Hanover on Sunday morning reported a serious traffic accident on Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the local exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.
The emergency forces are on site.

Football: Juve coach praises for top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening along with half an hour of Valencia," Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the 3-1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo’s three goal templates, Juve turned the game after the early lag by hitting Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst pursuer for the time being.
Torjäger, who was picked up by Real Madrid, first put on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work after a corner with a header for the goal of defence chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in shortly before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of templates," the coach praised.
But of course, Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team the record goal scorer.
“We need to get even better at serving him,” the coach said.
Best Juve goal scorer is currently Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to be even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years already has six points ahead of Naples.
The second table coach, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the referee of the already warned Mario Rui (58th) the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to go on too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red off the pitch.
"We played well against a good Naples," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was able to feel the same way.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
The professional from Liverpool FC was in use in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch in the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changed his name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West has garnered attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.
Among other things, his performance together with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let's just call him "yes," according to the musician.
"The creature formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in response to the late singer Prince, when he dropped his artist name.
The pseudonym is not news.
The 10th album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," the rapper said.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
It's done!
Hoetmar’s coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more grippy, we almost never had any problems with him". Accordingly, the list of Hoetmarer shots is read thin.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
A1: SC Hoetmar subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, but the first one used Maik Krause from a pointed angle to the early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after a great preliminary work by Krause he disbanded free standing.
The hosts only had a double chance when initially Moritz Höne failed at goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and in the follow-up Jan Blome also found his champion in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61th) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forgave.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the goal line and saw red - was also unable to use Niklas Eilmann for the guests (75th).
It was only when Nils Berheide punched the ball over the line that the match was decided (81.).
“We had criticized ourselves harshly before, and that was different today than in the last few weeks,” said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about it," he rang for words.
"We didn't get access to them at all", he allegedly meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites, who stood out with collective offensive urge.
Still, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, whining naughtyly and pulling from his players on the other hand was the relief to note that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Remember, after a duel between two teams, one of which, namely Albachen, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the preservation of the class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that were behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we keep against one of the league's top teams throughout the season, that was really phenomenal."
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top goaltender Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He placed the 2-0 on the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39th).
We knew that, but you can’t take a player like that out completely.
"That was madness, what he did," Lewandowski resented the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the side change, his own elf made up for it: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long toreck (45th).
After the side change it was again McGill who scored the balance (59th).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked albatross again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann balanced out (69th).
Albersloh did not manage to counter the last Concordia hit (80th) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Fröhning (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nübel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74th/Albachten).
Football: TSV Strassberg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The table leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff stood very well and in the end the game ended 0-0.
Media: Full Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire presidency of football club Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media outlets in the evening agreed on a joint letter from the Saxon Board.
At first, there was no confirmation from the association.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles in the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought that he should not have been invited.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers around 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has signaled to pick up the tolerance prize in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term was too short: As Federal President, he was not in Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
As Academy Director Udo Hahn said proudly: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors have already been with us." The fact that celebrities keep popping up at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also an issue at the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker attends a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, on 29 September the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has also promised that he will personally receive the “Tolerance Prize” awarded to him by the academy in Tutzing, which in another category is also given to television host Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 conferences until mid-2019 have it in them.
"The pension is not safe!" is stated in a conference title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without Limit".
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death - the war mocks every human idea".
From structural racism in society to the scissors between the poor and the rich, to the radical change in work through digitization, the spectrum extends.
“A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions.”
At a meeting at 200.
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits one more visitor to the direction of capitalism-criticism, the other more a tendency "from the left to the middle".
What about neutrality?
“We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church,” said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, “so we are not 100 percent neutral.”
Music cabaret: Gender communication with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
The musical cabaret with Tina Teubner was "suitable for both adults and men" on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret actress, Teubner used gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and mastered her violin.
On the wing was Ben Suverkrüp.
He is, on the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanying Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it fits with the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have emerged from Mozart’s composing if “the Nannerl” had opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" into the "Lied vom Tod", and from Mozart's g-moll symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Blumen presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
However, the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not accept an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo not only performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt but also one in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women's Bundesliga: Ahlener SG barely retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahleners had problems especially with the third-liga player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten goals.
"I was really happy with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We didn’t get them under control,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many outspoken opportunities.
The concentration in the final missed his team this time.
As a result, the ASG was behind almost to the end of a lag, was behind at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.).
Only towards the end did the wider bank of the hostess make itself decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put back room Merle Klement on the left, which then "extremely cleverly made the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
The blue and whites won 3-1 in the second-liga finish at VC Allbau Essen.
“It was a big step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
We have now achieved this," coach Dominik Münch was pleased after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the crashed table leader.
The first passage dominated the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice champion of the previous year.
Food has accepted in the two-bar, but has not come into play.
We've been busy with them.
Our opponent has hit with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second movement, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Eating has switched the adoption to triple bars.
We couldn't keep the pressure.
Food sucked up, and we let ourselves be lulled in a bit," Münch continued.
At 18:17, the women volleyball players from the Ruhr area had their noses for the first time.
At 19:24, Ostbevern was able to defend four sets of balls, but the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the exercise leader found to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and quietly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13, the Blue and White Pass brought four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
Turkish Community: Mosque Opening as Missed Chance
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a heap of shards in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be met with difficulty," said TGD chairman Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network of Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance to make a concerted, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of underlining the Muslims' affiliation to Germany alongside German top politicians, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has “reaffirmed many reservations”.
Home Association Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally Folktreff time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln is already organizing its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Old Office.
Almost exactly on the day it is then a year ago that we performed a folktreff for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our folk meeting would be so fast in Nottuln eta.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike in January or Hitzewelle in July, the fireplace room of the official staff was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old Schlager," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friendly musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has pledged his accordion for the first "birthday" of folk hits.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with German texts.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff are happy to remember the last event in summer when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" excited the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening once again," the home association said in an invitation.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to participate actively is invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there in good time.
The folk meeting starts at 7.30 p.m., but the entrance is already at 7 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking a further step towards becoming the world’s largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the proposed merger, Linde said on Sunday.
This means that the billion-dollar merger will still be subject to permits in South Korea and – as the biggest hurdle – in the US.
According to an insider, the chances of approval had improved there recently because Linde promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit farming to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125th anniversary of the Association for Horticulture and Regional Care was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, the last founding impulses for the district association for horticulture and state care Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, it was called at that time even different: as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit farming association was also different from today's work - it was actually all about fruit farming, no one thought about flowers and horticulture back then.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said district nurse Günter Dippold in his festive speech.
Fruit trees should line highways, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A close-to-nature horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the transfer of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
How versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are, the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Mouldings" showed entertainingly on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said Kreisvorsitzender Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
For us children, collecting chestnuts was a big deal, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added Landrat Söllner, highlighting the particular importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt about this.
He guided the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a presentation of images and, among other things, reported on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came from the garden, for the winter it was doped in.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden had turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature is still alive, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the expert advocated for fruit and nut trees.
That is why it is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let go, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, added the President of the Bavarian Land Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, the successful festival, which was solemnly framed by the tower winds of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister postpones UN speech
Mexico’s government wants clarity on Nafta: they provide both trading partners with an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada’s foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement – and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will not speak before the United Nations General Assembly until Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she is focusing on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada and US negotiators would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the US.
In August, the United States and Mexico agreed to recast the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be brought to a close, Trump’s government wants to present the agreement to the U.S. Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico’s designated President Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report from the daily O Globo.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked in early September during an election campaign event in southern Brazil on the open road.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people took to the streets to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele n<0xC3><0xA3>o" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
Also on the social networks, the associations made racist and women-despising statements against Bolsonaro’s.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run for office.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As former mayor of the million-dollar city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in the political operation for a long time, but recently presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a nomination on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this successfully - no matter who he is competing against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal disloyalties.
Another time he said the supporters of Lula’s left workers’ party should be shot.
Europe to regain Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale just outside Paris.
The outsider team of Captain Thomas Björn dethroned the favourite title defender USA around a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators on the three days at Le Golf National with great blows and outstanding team spirit.
After long illness: Danish rock legend dies
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen told Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark to date.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy's opponent Larsen had appeared on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rocknacht in der Schuhfabrik: Volume at the level of the compressed air hammer
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock purely by three other befriended bands.
After the sound check and just before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands, the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night visibly enthusiastic.
Even the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the CD that will be released soon.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the harmonious and expressive interplay of the band.
Although "Addition"-Calls are not to be overlooked, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock demonstrates guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock from the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", a synthesizer is also used for "Here We Stand" in addition to guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has gained a special degree of fame since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China of 2017 - has special stage experience is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in cooperation with the band, also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the process, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo to the sound that feels even higher than before, running through the audience.
A certain volume belongs to such a hard rock concert due to the genre of course: In the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to information from the mixed console team, the three-part concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the compressed-air hammer level, but is thus still clearly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", to which "The Ignition" on their website points.
Ear numbing 120 decibels in jet drive volume as usual in the annual metal setting in the north of the Republic, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night, however.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gang have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, albeit in a figurative sense, can say in the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in a glider crash at Essen/Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the crash.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
As the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reports, a glider plane had crashed on the exhibition car park at the airport.
The pilot died.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student had been on board alone - the plane is said to be a one-seater.
The plane had already landed at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance away from a marquee on the airport grounds.
However, an Oktoberfest has been taking place since this weekend.
The airport Mülheim/Essen is located on the city border of the two cities in the Ruhr area and directly at the entrance to the highway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at major events at Messe Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump says Kim “and then we fell in love”
It is no secret that North Korea’s leader Kim is well-informed despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a genuine declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim’s “beautiful letters.”
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has confessed to a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-year-old sprout of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although it turns out to be quite tough in the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
“I was tough, he was, and between us it was going back and forth,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- Okay.
No, really.
And it wasn’t just the conversations with Kim that made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the stopping of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
The U.S. president seemed well aware that the affection for the infamous “Rocket Man” – Trump’s nickname for Kim – should not be for everyone.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism of this at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: “Donald Trump says they fell in love.”
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresidial.
But he didn’t care much about it, Trump explained, and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena, but we'd only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospheric and also pampered by the sun: very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's downtown has cleaned up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest not only took place in the festival tent at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison via video
Nigerian refugees have made use of a mobile video to point out their disastrous detention conditions in Libya, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under danger of life and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," a man said in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the France 24 Observers website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
“Without the video, we probably could not have returned to Nigeria,” Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while attempting to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life, according to his own statement.
One of his co-workers was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the detention conditions have been catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
Approximately 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year with the help of the program, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor detention conditions in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a phone call.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as being inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the primary school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building via the main entrance.
In the front of the first floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase into the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher contacted the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot be said yet.
Description of the perpetrator: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark t-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg am Inn Police Inspectorate, phone number 059 133 4244.
German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central Franconia, after he had locked the car off all the forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers accidentally discovered the car near a pasture on Saturday afternoon and freed the missing person since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long period without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned from a ride with his off-road vehicle over the local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive search measures, the whereabouts of the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Minister-President Armin Laschet (CDU) has urged the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations between the two countries are currently “overshadowed”, Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns above all the waves of arrest, the freedom of the press and the freedom of religion.
He has therefore made clear at Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had recently been moved to a building of flight readiness of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan went on to open the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump does not tire of stressing the successes in the negotiations on North Korea’s denuclearization, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington to be welcomed.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
“The recent standstill comes from the fact that the U.S. is building on compulsive measures that are deadly for building trust,” Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves,” he said.
That sanctions could force North Korea to “knee” is “a wishful dream of people who don’t know us.”
To build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri pointed out.
However, there were no “corresponding reactions” from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council had decided three sanctions against the internationally isolated country last year alone.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have insisted on strict adherence to the sanctions in recent days at the United Nations.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will once again travel to Pyongyang for talks about ending the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors to the house of the open door HoT got nothing: white blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The youngsters of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had our refrigerators filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were perfectly prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: A power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start over again: we did get a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," Westbuer said.
And that's how everyone got along.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"It's not even better for chefs," one visitor praised, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people put on their feet," emphasized Reverend Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen was amazed with card tricks and other feats.
Jürgen Sator leaves the board of directors of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia
Out of frustration about criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become well known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as deputy chief of the NRW panels, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many fell in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding to the dpa for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism Sartor took with him.
"I can understand his step - people who didn't even know exactly why the Essener Tafel is doing it have spoken."
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized in the "Welt am Sonntag" again criticism of colleagues from other panels.
One should not take the approach, "without us, the people in the city are starving".
It is the task of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not attend a conference of the panels on Friday in Berlin.
“I’m being told too much sweet shit,” he said.
There are all those social fuzzies that criticized me that way back then.
SF Lorch play 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Fußball, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after a lag - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports friends was great.
In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but after 90 minutes won with 2:1.
Gladbach to play twice - Schalke without embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach still has to wait for an away victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) In the first five league games Schalke has maneuvered into the offside four times with early counter goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco once again showed the strength with which it had taken the first place behind Bayern in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Yevgeni Konopljanka per head, as a result the hosts preserved the mini-upholstery with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets new players from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had negotiated a 0:2-back against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but still came to a 4:2- win in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalled with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided another doublet in the final phase (86th/94th) for the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
The first victory was also won by VfB Stuttgart.
Against Werder Bremen, which had already been decimated before the break due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgarters had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler manufactured a curious throw-in goal that helped the guests to balance out in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also no failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave twice a lead out of hand, ultimately played 2:2 and have been waiting for an away victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1:1 compensation with his second Bundesliga player.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, as well as in the second counter-shot after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa proves to be a goalkeeper in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from the OGC Nice met for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven laps Gladbach occupies 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered against VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable location.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the former Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first season hit, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serb cashed after a jersey draw against Daniel Didavi Gelb-Rot.
Although Stuttgart defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremen back into the game through a curious throw-in goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters back on the victory road.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly for themselves.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already put the home team on track with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
Today, around 1.8 million people in Macedonia vote on whether to change the name of their country in northern Macedonia.
With a yes, the almost three decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
The electorate is therefore also deciding on the future Western integration.
The U.S. had announced that it could quickly become a NATO member in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrian in U-Haft.
Refugee attacked three women.
One Syrian brutally beat three pensioners and severely injured them as a result.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had ransacked on Friday at around 10 p.m. in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who was walking past passers-by with clenched fists and trying to attack them, about his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat the officials and kick them.
A little later, it turned out that the suspect had hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists just before in the Währinger Straße at a tram stop.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave their yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered partnership had not been considered for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget spokesperson for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had caused a stir with a rage on June 30, 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "disrupted" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as in the case of adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Bürgervereinigung Kinderhaus and the Gesellschaft für Leprakunde.
Because around 400 meters of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfündnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
“We do this to reduce costs,” said Walter Schröer, chairman of the citizens’ association.
And so much has been accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now only a shape cut.
In the spring, the hedge was shaved.
The breakfast always followed by work also has a long tradition.
“Everyone should be able to stay strong,” said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the World Canoe Slalom Championship
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner has won the gold medal at the end of the World Canoe Slalom Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had already enough rides here on the facility and it all fit today," said the Olympic third of London 2012.
At the finish, he threw his paddle away from joy and held both arms up victorious – knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had starting number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Czech Jiri Prskavec finished second before Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate mentions the first attempted burglary in a single-family home this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter – burglars want to take advantage of this again.
For example, the Gauting Police Inspectorate reported yesterday the first burglary attempt this autumn.
The fact that it remained at the detached house on Königswieser Straße during the attempt is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they took the flight without prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Failure at Hertha: Captured by reality: Bayern against Ajax challenged
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin wants FC Bayern "not to be pleased".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim draft for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance dial under the new coach Niko Kovac should by no means increase to the greater autumnal depth for the Munichs.
A week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now the reality has caught up to us a bit,” Thomas Müller noted after the earned 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year away, no goal was scored, as at the same time of the previous season two mandatory matches in series without a win, the table lead in the football Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall situation is far from as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg in the 1-1 with its intensive man-against-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last overpowering Bayern are to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we won't let this happen and we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the once again deficient handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first interim term of his term positive before the international break - otherwise the tone would probably worsen.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second royal class appearance of this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second preliminary game against Ajax, which had also defeated AEK Athens with 3-0 at the start, begins.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," National Team captain Manuel Neuer announced.
As already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke above all plain text.
The defendant acted as a reminder.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes in the back," the 23-year-old said shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bayern were even behind Dortmund with five points, which has now taken the lead again with a point advantage.
And so, with a wink at least, Kimmich appreciated positively that the public debate about supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
“Yes, that’s good,” said the international player.
It’s good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
A new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent dispute theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
In the early Sunday morning, the Grindel, personally sharply attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the causa in the ZDF "sports studio" in Mainz.
"In the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that such a thing is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral town.
Honestly, as their president, I couldn’t believe that our two young men, who rose up to the German national team, were marginalized.
Grindel referred to Gündogan’s statement that unlike Özil after the World Cup affair, which started with photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt “reasonably treated by the DFB”.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil’s return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration officer will now be appointed alongside Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background clearly works into society and football and says, 'The issue is important, we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration has to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup off and the Özil affair, he wants to run for office as DFB president again next year.
“I do my job and try to make it as good as I can,” Grindel said.
Yearly builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to police reports, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he was driving against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had come off the road and driven against a control post.
Responding to this, the man did not want police on the spot and then drove away.
Afterwards, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, in his place of residence, where he has been living for decades, the pensioner has been prosecuting himself and ramming a construction vehicle while turning.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car suffered significant accidental damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and couldn’t remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moor fire in Meppen: still almost 1000 operational forces in operation.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in the Emsland, 980 operatives are still busy with the extinguishing work.
This was reported by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop stable, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers were recently deducted.
A further reduction of the number of emergency forces is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire was discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the catastrophe was lifted, which was declared well a week earlier on September 21 because it was feared that the flames would endanger neighboring forests and settlements due to wind and sparks.
On Thursday, it was said that an overrun of the fire on neighboring communities no longer threatens.
At times, more than 1,500 emergency personnel tried to get the big fire under control.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "tornados" are also planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand had at times moved up to a hundred kilometers far across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that accepts damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician has married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
They have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave their yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered partnership had not been considered for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
If we get married, that's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget spokesperson for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had caused a stir with a rage on June 30, 2017.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "disrupted" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as in the case of adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Approximately 1.8 million voters should decide whether their state should be named North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the same name, the neighbouring Greece.
As a means of pressure, for almost three decades, Athens had blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the starting signal for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The Author Who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in 2016 in the United States, leaving behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register of organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
If necessary, your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with explicit consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases, a card is found at the decisive moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
“You then have to make a decision in the deceased’s sense, which is often very burdensome,” says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has voted in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or his family members disagree.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head counting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in head calculating.
He won the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, said on Sunday.
16-year-old Wenzel Greetings from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as Chief Arbitrator Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel greeted from Lastrup, demonstrating how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greet was there two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms like superbrain, genius or miracle child, organizer Laue can start little.
"Head calculations can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-based computational competitions.
Disciplines include, for example, square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they have to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have good chances, said the main arbitrator.
Otherwise, Asians are often an advantage, because head calculations are learned more intensively and with other, effective methods already in early childhood.
Urgent Appeal: Video With Nude Serena Williams: It's About Breast Cancer Early Detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams shows off from her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and advocate for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.

Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the “I Touch Myself” project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
An emergency operation was initiated to save the baby’s life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serena’s lungs.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "symbols law" to review.
The aim is to significantly expand the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle is shaking her beds in the West for the first time next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at a high intensity, it said.
20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected from the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions therefore become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start their annual knee care on Monday.
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers are allowed to start their annual buckling care on Monday.
The "green walls" that are unique in Germany have been shaping the landscape of the federal state of Valdarno for about 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges, which are up to five meters wide, are "forest set" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect, as corridors scattered, located habitats through which the exchange of organisms can still function, said the managing director of the German Conservation Confederation (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the orders of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundary and cattle fence, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
His name "Knick" also dates back to that time: the dense, intertwined demarcations were able to develop by "bending" the branches.
Today, around 45,000 kilometers of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the picture of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
In one kilometre of kink, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the bend can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in the winter.
Otherwise, he becomes a light tree series, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, bend care can only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After a tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about local situation
The local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND):
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were over, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport on Palu was closed at that time.
What is the situation on the island?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also housed other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, some of the prisoners are running around freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information supply on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that did not work and we only got information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who they don’t know if they live and where they are, because during the earthquake people were not at home, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Ring of Fire not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to give up Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had pulled a muscle fiber tear in the rear left thigh in the 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football Bundesliga announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss matches after the next break in the international game.
VfB Stuttgart did not provide a downtime forecast.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Seb<0xC3><0xA1>stian Film Festival
San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n - The Film Festival of San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n closes the line of the most prestigious European festivals every year.
Despite all the chants on the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire department tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action continued for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers on Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She was in the water station area.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to dodge the armed forces over and over again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back ashore, where it was then after almost an hour by a firefighter with a hearty handle put into a transport box.
The duck injured in the chest was then taken to the LMU animal clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard wins World Cup medal
In fourth place at Olympia, biathlete Julian Eberhard was in the stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up with the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the medal close to grabbing.
Seven tenths of a second was missing in the end on bronze.
“I deliberately took the time to process this,” says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn’t want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point you have to hit.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is located at Eberhard: "I have already closed the track to the heart", he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) on second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at a turbo speed
The time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at a turbo pace, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the ultra-thin majority for the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial for allegations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The latest turn in the drama about Kavanaugh’s vocation, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the jurist burst out angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judicial Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge in the Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake, contrary to his original announcement, declared that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called Thursday’s heavy talks “dirty,” initially abstained from further attacks on the women and, on the contrary, spoke of “happiness in misfortune.”
In this way, final doubts could be eliminated, he said.
Later, in an election rally, Trump attacked Democrats sharply for rejecting Kavanaugh: “They’re trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely restricted the powers of investigators.
They will investigate the well-known accusations of two women, nothing more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are expected to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit is stationed on the garden road from Monday, 1 October, according to the municipality.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You have felt the fear
Trainers Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I’ve seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room," said Schalke 04's sports board and breathed.
After all, the Royal Blues were still able to bring the close 1-0 against the Rhine Hessians over time and thus the first win of the season under the roof.
In fact, it could have happened differently.
After the lead of Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given Tedesco safety to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and pressing"., with increasing playing time, the head obviously played a role.
Don't really create a head-ball monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel, "if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore withdrew further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"We have all fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in this with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the team."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start in the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it,” said Schalkes chief coach.
Victory was important.
We can finally enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Royal Blue missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry about.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the latte twice 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a bitter victory," Tedesco said, "you've already felt the fear a bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He wasn’t the only squirrel.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal valley 2 km visible
The smoke was not overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal has observed a fire on Sunday around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: an unknown man had lit garbage on a two-square-meter area on the Gschwendner mountain.
According to police, it seemed that he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the flame unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
Police are investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task for many years to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Culture Policy" in the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, fixed numbers and one or the other joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise in spite of successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses himself to answer the question of a metaphor.
German society sits at a table, the first-generation migrants sit at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
It is therefore not decisive whether one is politically to the right or to the left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first, rather behave, then the discussion round starts more and more lively.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is on equal footing.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the issue, because "first, when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing hour, he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, was intensively further discussed.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first matchday of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen prevailed in a hard-fought match in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
First leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, German champions Bayern Munich and former series champion Brose Bamberg had much more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday to a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the newly built area of Landsham-Süd on the open market.
Mayor Roland Frick said.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots that the municipality offers at more favourable conditions or prices is completed - similar to the previous local model.
More than 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"The documents are currently being reviewed" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Plieninger mayor, the goal is to have the applicant rankings for the 20 plots drawn up by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council.
After that, the award can be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses will be created on the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses with eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
A single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private individual, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the two apartment buildings of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated on the area of the new Landsham-Süd area, housing is created for about 200 people.
Not only that: now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, there is the start for the construction of a new daycare center.
It will house three kindergarten and three nativity groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
How Schalkes Naldo "big sport" also succeeds on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting eleven: Despite this, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalker Startelf for the third time in a row, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the Brazilian, almost two meters tall, had really talked about the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1-0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked head coach Domenico Tedesco to all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who all call Naldo for simplicity, turned in and said: "We have to thank coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his renewed reservist existence, had no resentment.
Probably Naldo, who has been hailed as the best Schalker last season, knows that he hasn’t really gotten on the slop with his coach – but for good reason he gets a break.
A reason called "load control".
It was not easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you honestly," Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starting eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” Tedesco said.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that at the moment everyone can sniff through.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which also caught Naldo recently.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to accelerate in August compared to the Eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) stood at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
However, Austria still has the third best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still the 13th month in a row below the mark of 50 points, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland’s industry hit this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44.0 points.
“The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst has survived,” said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains the number one growth brake in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as sharply as since November 2011.
The companies therefore reduced jobs for the seventh month in a row.
In China, too, industrial production fell more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers’ Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are highlighted.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds behind victory in eighth league match
September 29, 2018 at 7:45 PM
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won with two hits by superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar put PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and made the final in the post-match time.
In the meantime, Christopher Nkunku (46th) took care of the 2:0.
With this, Paris also succeeded in the general rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the season, Tuchel's team had to take on the only mandatory game defeat so far in Liverpool at the 2-3.
